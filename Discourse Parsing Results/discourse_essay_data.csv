1004,"Well , college is turning out to be quite an adventure , although I could have guessed that before I got here .  I am enjoying meeting different kinds of people as well as being challenged in all of my classes .  I could probably do with less reading assignments , but the majority of the text that I 've been reading holds the same principal .  Learn to question things and make a decision on your own , with ideas to support it .  I like this concept , it allows several possibilities in every aspect of life .  The idea that the classroom wants me to think critically is exciting .  My first impression when I walked into a big lecture class was intimidating .  I 'm used to the small classrooms where I know the other students around me and I 'm comfortable with them .  I can also get bored with them as well , so the big classrooms allow me to meet different people every day , this is something I definately like .  I like to think that there are a lot of other college freshman feeling the same feelings that I am feeling , that I 'm not the only one that is scared and intimdated yet excited all at once .  It makes me feel not so alone , in s University as large as this one it becomes a necessity to not feel alone or isolated by your fears .  Making new friends is difficult but I think that the majority of freshman on campus are open to forming new friendships with many different people .  The entire aspect of not living with my parents and having them in the same house as me p = monitoring my decisions and actions is both liberating and terrifying .  I feel as though I have a chance to completly be myself and decide if the person I have been for the past eighteen years is truly me , but at the same time , I wonder if I can meet my parents expectations of greatness .  Will I be the type of person that they would be proud of , will I have the ideas and beliefs that are acceptable to them .  My fear of not meeting their expectations is not completely overwhelming because they have always taught me to question things and I think that if I form my own beliefs that happen to differ from their beliefs , they will be accepting if and only if I have reached that conclusion through logic and reasoning and I can support my ideas with valid argumentation .  It definately can become intimidating at times though .",0,10,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,8,36,1,3,0,3,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,61,0

1011,"why did these girls from my hometown just call me and invite my roomate and I to a frat party ?  what were they thinking ?  these silly girls went to school with me for 4 years , and all of a sudden I have changed into a college girl that wants to drink , party , and hang out with jocks ? ?  uhhh , I do n't think so .  I mean , it is a nice gesture , I guess .  I would almost rather they not call at all .  that would make me feel so much better , I hate seeing all of those kingwood people in austin .  I eamn , I did come here to expand my horizons .  I do not think that frat parties are neccessary to experience what college is all about .  So , I decided to stay at home and work on psychology homework .  Why ?  it is n't like I am enjoying this .  I would much rather be out watching a band , or listening to music , or hanging out with my best friend holly .  I really like the fact that we are roomates now .  over the summer and for about the last year or so , we did n't get to hang out very much .  But , now that we are here , it is like we are getting to know each other all over again , and I love that .  Even though we are extremely different now , she is like part of my family and makes this huge campus seem somewhat small and unintimidating .  She is also a lot like me , like when those girls called , I could tell by her facial expressions that it was a ridiculous idea .  It was almost as though I could read her mind .  My foot itches .  Tomroow , I am going to church for the first time in about 6 months .  I do n't know why I stopped going , maybe I got too pessimistic or maybe my spiritual side just died with the loss of some important friends .  I am not really sure , but I am certainly hoping to revive that side of me , because I definately need some sort of outlet for all of this stress and lonliness .  No , that is not the right word , I am not lonely , maybe just scared of what I am to become being spiritually dark .  Why did that happen ?  I do n't understand so many things , but I am trying .  I have also been going with Holly , my best friend , to her church related organization on campus .  I really like it a lot , maybe things will change soon .  I miss my mom .  I hope that she is ok without me , and my little brother too .  He is in second grade and doing so well , but he hates school .  He is n't very attentive , but very creative .  I miss my family , we were very close .  Except for my dad , he is a jerk .  I wonder sometimes if I will ever find it important to speak to him again .  I do n't really think so .  He does nothing but cause stress and harm , he does n't pay attention unless it is something bad .  He does n't know me , yet he seems to evaluate my every BAD move , without noticing the good ones .  I am not a girl that holds onto grudges , but I am too pessimisstic right now to forgive him .  Maybe it will come in time .  I hope that I am not studying the wrong things for class .  I often wonder how I am going to make the grades .  I mean , I know I can , I am very smart , but it is hard to concentrate right now with all of these things happening at once .  Especially coming to college for the first time .  I never dreamed that it would be as draining as it is .  Once again , I am so glad to have Holly here to keep me in my comfort zone .

Today is a very sad day for many .  The new of Princess Diana 's death has just unfolded .  It is very strange that every time a prominent "" celeb "" dies the world acts as if they knew them personally .

I am feeling a bit like Doogie Howser ( at the end of each episode , it is night and he normally sits at his computer and types his journals out and reflects upon the events that happened throughout the day ) .  I am typing this in Microsoft word , because it was recommended by your little site and was repeated about 4 times .  Although I have Physics tomorrow , which I have no clue what is going on in because my teacher is a bit confused himself .  I am feeling relieved because I had this HUGE paper due in my freshman seminar class today and I worked my ass off for it and I feel good about it .  I am not all that great of a writer but I think I will get a decent grade on it .  Plus it was only a first draft , and we will have to go back and revise them and whatnot .  By the time I am completely finished with the paper I am going to despise it but hey , that is how it goes , I suppose .  I think it is good for a person to just sit and write or type every once and a while .  I have a friend , Olga , who has gone through like 12 journals in the past 3 years .  She tries to find time for it everyday .  it is her relaxation and when she is really upset or depressed , once she gets everything out .  she feels better .  Which reminds me , I need to give her a call .  I miss her .  She goes to Southwest Texas .  I am actually sitting on the phone with my boyfriend who is also in the class ( Michael Linford ) .  We are both typing this writing assignment at the same time .  Well .  I thought it was a bit humorous .  I am actually in a really good mood , because my boyfriend and I actually live in the same city now .  It is a really good feeling .  We met last year , here in Austin at debate camp .  He is from Colleyville ( DallasFort Worth ) , so we spent just under a year living 4 hours apart from each other .  All of my classes are going pretty good , although I still do n't really have a clue what I want to major in just yet .  I am in the college of Liberal Arts ( woo hoo ! )  and I was thinking about a double major in psychology and government .  I also want to go to law school .  I seriously doubt I will get into UT 's law school .  It is way too competitive .  * Sigh * who knows , I sure do n't .  I am living at Dobie right now , and let me tell youI am getting ripped off .  It is $ 7000 a year and I have a little room and have to walked up stairs all the time because I live on the 2nd floor ( the "" intensive study floor "" ) , which I never signed up to be in .  I guess it is n't all that bad though ; at least I 'm not at Jester .  I do n't have a car here because my parents are irrational .  I have a car sitting in the garage at home but they did n't want me to bring it with me because they thought it would be some sort of a "" growing experience "" for me .  Although I only live around an hour or so away from here ( Schertz , TX .  near San Antonio ) I have n't been home since I have been here .  I have no real desire to go home .  I hated high school , well I hated it my senior year .  All my friends graduated and my classes were a waste of time .  I guess that is one of the reasons why I feel I ca n't compete with some of the people here at UT , my high school did n't have much to offer .

I have so much homework everyday and I do n't know I hate precal .  and I have homework in that class all the time and now I have to worry about the precal test on Monday .  and dietary analysis do on Friday .  and nutrition and psychology test on Monday after that oh my gosh I guess the professors just like to torture us by having due dates and test all in the same day and I have a tennis tryout on Monday .  that means I have to skip my psychology class and my tasp thing .  gosh .  and I do n't know why .  but I just ca n't pass tasp I know that English is my second language but I 've written so many paper .  and I do ok on them but I just do n't understand why I ca n't pass writing part on the tasp this is crazy .  and since this is the first semester in ut I have n't got an apartment and so my parents is making me living with our family friends and I really really do n't enjoy being with them so .

I fear that I will not be able to put enough effort into accomplishing my tasks in school and at home .  Thus , most of the time I reflect on future and find myself greatly concerned and worried .

Often , I feel that college has placed a great burden both financially and emotionally on my parents .  This , in turn , causes much sadness for me .  Although the social aspect of my life , at the moment , is not a significant matter , I still find myself looking back at the days in high school and at the friends that I left behind .

After high school , everyone left there own way in seeking out a future for themselves .  One friend would move to New York and another would move to California .  The once click of friends that you grew up is now a long distance relationship creating friends coast to coast .  Although UT is a new change for me , it is one that is welcoming because it begins a new chapter in your life and basically gives you a clean slate to work on .  From this day forward , I am able to become whatever my heart desires and whatever happened in the past I can put behind as memories .  The challenge is a great one however with its competitive nature .  Back in high school , I would hear stories of friends failing out of UT due to its luring temptation of the atmosphere of clubs and alcohol .  Everyone seemed to be lured into the trap and go deranged when they got on their own .  I would hear stories of friends messing up in school and having to return home .  These stories although depressing helped me however in establishing the goal that I would not be like the rest , but an individual .  That 's what UT is basically is , just a group of individuals all with the same goal , a goal of succeeding which is sad that some take it lightly and begin to ruin their lives .

I am kind of stuck right now on what to type , but the assignment calls for us to write exactly what pops into my head while typing , and I guess this is it .  I am thinking that I should be someplace right now I think that I may have missed something important all of a sudden .  That is really scary .  I hate that feeling .  I am really tired right now and could really use a nap .  I tossed and turned all last night and could n't fall asleep .

It 's weird , I 've only known her since I moved here in August , and already we are good friends and plan on living together next year .  We want to live at Orange Tree because it 's cute .  I looked on the Internet for some info on it , and there is none .  I think it is stupid that we have to go apartment shopping in September for a place we wo n't move into for almost a year .  Oh well , we are doing it now so we do n't get screwed .  I was just talking to Corey , my cute boyfriend , and I was telling him about the pleasure center in mice and how different it was from humans .  I always tell him what I 've learned in class because it helps me remember it .  I feel sorry for him , I would n't want to hear it if I were him .  He 's so nice like that .  I ordered cookies last night from Tiffany 's Treats , they deliver freshly cooked cookies to your door .  Anyway , I was in a friend 's room at Hardin Housewhich I hate and we were talking about boyfriends and stuff .  I told them I want to get married on November 19 , 2005 to Corey .  They laughed and asked why , so I told them .  We 've actually talked about marriage , and we both love each other that much , so it 's cool .  We want to live together in a couple of years .  Actually he is going to live near us at Orange Tree if at all possible .  He has a brother who is a year younger , Codey , who is a pothead .  He has a girlfriend Amy , who I do n't like .  She 's only a freshman in high school , but she does n't belong with him .  Corey and Codey are total opposites .  I have a lot of work to do .  Tonight I have to do calculus , read for my freshman seminar , and do my Italian work .  I got a quiz back today from that class , and I got a 75 .  I was so upset .  I 'm used to A 's .  Italian is not a required course for my major , so I was wondering if I could take it pass/fail .  That would be good , then it could n't bring down my GPA .  I need to ask some one about that .  I hate my roommate and suitemate .  They are so damn loud .  Caroline , the suitemate has people over now who are very loud .  I like it quite , but that does n't happen here at Hardin House .  I went through rush this year and got a bid from A Chi O , but I decided not to pledge .  I am glad I did n't because they are out all of the time , and I 'm taking 16 hours this and every other semester .",0,18,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,13,72,2,14,0,5,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5,0,0,0,0,12,134,10
113,it seems to me that the purpose of this assignment is not really to examine our mundane thoughts that we perceive but the logic behind the way our mind thinks .  Since most my time is spent analyzing my thoughts and their processes I think that I must examine more of the logical progression .  This entry to me simulates making an entry into my journal .  I look at that and realize that everything in their is exactly what you want .  The most interesting things that I think about and that lead into other realms our my interactions with other people .  Today at dinner I saw my ex-girlfriend from high school .  she was n't just a high school crush but the relationship lasted for over a year .  After our break up things went down hill to the point that we do n't ever talk to each other any more .,0,12,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,44,1,1,0,4,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,4,68,2
1141,"Sitting here in front of my large window , I notice the rays of sun filtering into my dorm room .  Everything feels fresh and clean , except for that pile of clothes laying next to my bed .  I love warmth any form of it actually .  Sometimes I wonder why my hands and feet get so cold .  Does my heart not pump hard or fast enough ?  My old special boyfriend used to tell me , "" cold hands , warm heart .  "" That was something his mother used to say .  I guess she had cold hands too .  Right now , I am wondering about my present faith and how that should impact or change my actions and choices .  I am no way questioning my faith in God , but instead , how such faith should be transforming me throughout this transition period that I am experiencing .  For instance , ever since going through rush and pledging , I have been put into many situations that I am not normally used to .  Basically , my biggest concern is partying and or drinking .  For me personally , I feel that alcohol is something that I really do n't need to have fun .  Then , why did I go against my believe and have a drink anyway ?  After confronting myself in front of my god of such temptation and hypocrisy , I have done much better .

I am trying to relax right now so that I am not tense .  Stress keeps being the topic of discussions in my classes , Health Promotions , ( eeh .  my leg is shaking again ! )  Nutrition and Psychology .  These classes seem to be overlapping each other a lot during subject matter .  I do n't know why I kept avoiding this assignment .  I have been putting it off .  I think I feel incompetent when it comes to writing .  It 's not something I would consider myself skilled at .  Yes , writing intimidates me .  I should n't think that I am so inferior .

I 'm going to let you know about a little situation I have undergone recently , and see if I can figure out why women are so weird .  Ok so first off , I had this girl , we 'll call her Jessica , that I have been in love with since 8th grade but never got a chance to pursue .  As a background on her , she is a player ; meaning that she likes to lead guys on , then break their hearts .  But she still had me swooning over her for some reason .  She has been my best friend for almost 2 years and so I this summer I decided to give it a shot and ask her out , after all I had nothing to lose .  So I asked her out , and she said no because : "" the timing is wrong , college is coming up and I do n't want to start anything because I like you so much that I think it would actually be a relationship and not just a game for me "" .",0,19,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,11,22,1,6,0,15,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,16,82,0
1145,"Okay , I am starting to write for this assignment .  I do n't really know what I 'm supposed to write , but I guess it 's sort of like a journal and I 'm supposed to write whatever I am thinking .  I am kind of overwhelmed by school right now .  It is so big here , and it 's kind scary .  I 'm used to knowing everyone around , but here I do n't know anyone .  Friends is on right now .  It 's pretty funny .  I miss being in Houston where everything is normal .  I 'm not used to the times shows come on here .  This sounds really stupid , like I am just rambling on about nothing .  Friends is funny .  Am I doing this right ?  I do n't know if this is what y ' all are asking me to do .  I miss John , the guy I am dating from Houston .  I do n't really want anything serious with him , but I like him a lot so I am kind of confused on what I should do .  Should I have my fun and not date someone I really like a lot , or should I date him and maybe miss out on opportunities to have fun at school .  I do n't know I am not sure .  And then there is my exboyfriend Ricky .  I do n't want to be with him , but sometimes I miss him .  I think it is only when I think back on high school I think about the good times we had and I miss that .  I also do n't like it that maybe I made the wrong choice in not wanting him and moving on .  What if I totally regret it in the future , and I want him back , but he does n't want me .  That would be horrible .  I do n't know .  I 'm just pretty confused right now .  I do n't know what I want about anything .  It 's hard getting used to everything around here .  I miss the show 90210 .  I was just thinking about it for some weird reason .  That used to be my favorite show , but it got canceled .  I 'm supposed to go to a frat party tonight but I do n't know if I 'm going to go or not .  My roommate does n't want to go cause she needs to do work .  She 's the same major as me .  She 's a pretty good influence on me .

It 's not just that I feel sad but I feel guilty to .  My dad is so awesome and when I lived at home I never really appreciated him .  Sometimes I can be so incredibly selfish and self absorbed .  I guess experiences like leaving home are good for us because they help open our eyes and let us see things that we would n't ordinarily .  At home I was in my own little world which revolved around my school , friends , and family .  Now being in Austin with out any of these comforts , I feel much more vulnerable and also naive .  Living on the drag can open your eyes more than anything .  My dad told me that just yesterday the bank underneath my building got robbed .  That kind of stuff freaks me out because I go to that bank constantly and I just never expect anything like that to happen .  I really do n't understand why people do things like robbing a bank .

I want to read Harry Potter .  I think that I almost make myself want to read because my mom loves it so much .  I love my mom , and I miss going to camp .

My mom once told me that she still feels like she has to do what her mother thinks is right , but she has learned to not feel guilty for a decision she feels is the best one .  My boyfriend thinks I try to please to many people and I need to start doing what I want .  I guess he does n't know that I try to please him the most .  He thinks he is not one of the people that makes me unhappy .  He is older and he thinks he knows more than I do , but went to A&M so there is no way that is true .  Most of my friends stayed in Austin , but some of by best friends went to far away places and I already miss them a lot .  I live with three of my best friends from high school .  My room roommate and I get along great and have been friends since we were five , and the other two I have known since we were eleven .  So far everything is going well in our new apartment , but one girl has decided it is not her job to clean anything , and we are going to have to talk to her about that .

I 'm not sure why I felt that way , I was surrounded by two of the people I feel most comfortable around .

I was first involved in a relationship in my sophomore year of high school , were I felt as if I was in love with this girl .  We took it to the extreme where we contemplated about getting married and planning the number of kids we would have .  But this form of love seemed to build so quickly .  As I looked back at the letters we wrote each other , it seems we fell in love in a matter of a month or two .  How cold that be ?

I was so overwhelmed by it all .  I decided to go through rush here at UT , and that was an experience all on it 's own .  It was a week full of stress , and aching feet .  You are surrounded by a bunch of girls that are trying to out do the next and you ca n't really tell if people are being fake or themselves .  I just hoped for the best and tried to have fun .  Now that it is all over and I made my bid .  I was relieved a little , but not enough .  The day after rush ended classes begin .  I had no time to relax or get things together .  I was stressing out more than I had ever before .  I did n't know where my classes were , I missed my friends and family , my roommate and I have been a little off , it seemed like nothing was going right .  I really wanted to cry .  It 's so hard for me to think that I am not happy here because I can vividly recall not too long ago saying that I could n't wait to get out of high school and get to college .  I was so excited about moving to Austin .  I did n't think I would miss my family too much because they would be coming down for all the home football games .  Boy , was I wrong .  I told everyone that I would n't think of going home my first weekend of college , but as I sat in my dorm room last Friday thinking about all my friends going home for the holiday I do n't think I could have packed up my stuff any quicker .  I was so excited about going home .  I could n't wait to get there .",0,17,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,21,1,10,0,6,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,6,65,0

I wonder if I really have to read all the chapters or if I can just rely on Mr.  Pennebaker 's lectures .  I hope I do n't fail psychology class .  I hope that I pass with an A.  Wow , I feel like I 'm just babbling now .  Will this paper get too long ?  My mind seems so boring up there .  The things that are coming out on paper right now are so boring and useless , but this is what I was told to do .  I 'm trying really hard to type without stopping but it 's hard .

1263,"What does the drug ecstasy do to the brain ?  I have been very curious about this for some time now .  Maybe you could tell us what studies have concluded about this drug .  The reason why I am so curious is because many of my friends have recently discovered and become enchanted with it .  In fact , in about the middle of the second semester of my senior year in high school , it became almost like an ecstasy epidemic !  Several of my friends have done it up to 11 or 12 times already !  I have n't tried it since I refuse to do drugs but I 'm really interested to find out what its long term effects are and why it produces the reaction that it does .  Apparently , when on ecstasy , it feels as if nothing can go wrong and everything is perfect .  Music is everything and once listening , someone who is rolling ( the term used to define the feeling one gets after taking X ) ca n't pull away .  Also , they say they feel as if they have "" lungs of steel "" in that they are constantly smoking cigarettes and feel as if they ca n't stop .  Oh , and the mouth chewing .  Why does that happen ?  Their mouths jitter while they 're rolling and after the drug wears off , their mouths hurt or feel sore .  That 's why you can tell when someone is rolling at a party .  Well , first of all they 're sweating profusely and also they 're chewing lots and lots of gum !  Its crazy actually .  I went to a rave with my friends last Saturday .  It was at Austin Music Hall .  At least 70 % of the people attending the rave was rolling on X.  Well , essentially , that 's what rave 's are for .  Its a closed space with djs who spin techno and trance music for a huge group of people , the majority of whom is Xing like crazy !  Anyway , my friends had a blast there .  of course they were rolling .  I had fun too , but not nearly as much I imagine !  In fact , it was 3:30 in the morning , we had been dancing for at least 4 hours straight , and one of my friends refused to leave because he was rolling so hard and not remotely tired .  Does n't this sound crazy ?  What does the drug do to people ?  Have any severe , longlasting consequences been discovered for sure .",0,20,2,0,1,0,0,0,3,12,36,1,16,0,8,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,30,97,6

Man I do n't know if I want to join a sorority or not , and if I do i 'm not sure which one to join .  there are so many different ones with unique styles .

It 's what I feel and think and want to say , which is always nice , especially in writing .  I 'm used to doing this though I guess cause I write in my journal often .  I never type though , so I guess I 'm getting more said .  And believe it or not , I always worry about space on my journal .  Like , I worry that I 'll "" waste "" too many spaces on only one entry .  I think I 'm so weird .  I guess I do kind of like to keep things in order and not waste too much .  I am like that in many ways I guess .  But I 'm also guessing it 's a better trait to have than not .  I do n't know .  My computer is making funny noises .  I hate my computer cause I paid close to two thousand dollars for it and it does n't even shut down properly .  Plus , stupid Dell wo n't help me any .  I write them and tell them of my technical problem and they just reply to my emails with dumb strategies that do n't even work .  I 've already tried a million times .  It makes me want to not fix it at all and just shut it down with the power surge adaptor under my desk .  I miss home .  I wish I could go home and be with my mom and not worry about money or food or weight .  I 'm gaining so much weight .  I lost about ten pounds my senior year and everybody was complaining that I looked anorexic .  Now that I 'm in Austin , I 've already gained those ten back and I 'm scared that now I 'll turn into too big of a girl , that ill be that girl , the bigger one than all the other girls .  I was only maybe 110 pounds but because all of my friends weighed 90 , I looked bigger .  Maybe that 's why they never wanted to go out with me .  I do n't know .  Maybe it 's cause I 'm Korean , I do n't look like most of the people where I 'm from .

Fears a plague of man for centuries , we can find cures to anything but be most tormented by nothing more than our own conscious being .

1325,"I have so many stressors in my life right now , and I 've decided that since I have to do this stream of consciousness exercise anyway , this is probably the best place to vent .  While being a freshman on a campus of 50,000 people is intimidating and scary , it is n't nearly as threatening as people made it out to be at least not yet .  My current stressful situations lie in areas of my life that have nothing to do with college .  To be honest , right now , my biggest problem is with my parents .  After being divorced for some time now , they have just gotten to the point where they have started to fight and bicker about everything , and of course , I always end up in the middle .  My mother complains about how difficult her life is because of my father , which I 'm sure it is .  This is not to say that he is a perfect person , because I know he is not , but the way she portrays him , you would think that he is not human .  My father is very critical and judgmental of everything my mother does , and the both of them feel the constant need to tell me how they feel about the other .  Now , I am adult enough to realize that after a bitter divorce , there will certainly be problems . They have every right in the world to be furious with each other .  All I ask is that they do not drag me into the middle of it .  I have told them both this on several occasions , and they both apologize and vow to not do it again .  However , before long , they are up to the same old game again , and it makes me feel about 2 inches tall .  I am forced to choose sides , and since I love both my parents , this provides for a very stressful situation .  I am getting to the point that I am ready to tell them both that I will not speak to either of them or have any contact what so ever until they talk to each other and get at least to the point where they can tolerate living in the same city with one another .  I do n't ask that they try to love each other again , or even like each other , because those days are obviously through .  I just want things to be relatively peaceful and not for there to be a war zone .  Another result of this fighting is the separation of me and my siblings .  This has nothing to do with the fact that I live on campus , my little sister lives with my mom , and my brother lives with my dad .  While this is n't the ideal living situation , there is certainly nothing awful about it .  What their fighting has caused is rifts between the kids .  It has gotten to the point that we choose sides against our parents , and therefore , against each other .  I feel like I ca n't say anything bad about my mother in front of my sister because she will just run back and report what I say .  If I wanted to say those things to my mom , I would say them .  I do n't need a messenger .  Dr Pennebaker , if you are reading this , I accidentally pressed send and did not get to complete my writing .  I apologize and hope this does n't cause any problems . Anyway , another problem I have with my family is the direct relationship between my mother and I.  We have always had different personalities , and they have often clashed .

I hope the twenty minutes that I am required to write for pass by in a hurry , because I have yet to finish some of my Economics homework that is due in class today .  I have yet to discern whether my Economics professor is adequate in his teachings .  On several occasions , he has veered off the lecture topic and has attempted to entertain the class with anecdotes and personal experiences that possess no ties to the world of economics .  On the other hand , my Calculus II teacher is not my favorite , because he moves very quickly through sections of the book and speaks very poor English .  I am not quite sure where exactly he is from but his accent makes it difficult to understand his lectures .

We decided to plan something so that we would n't for forget each other , but I guess it 's happening sooner than we thought .  We 've all been together for a very long time .  6 years I think .  I do n't care .  I guess it 's not that big of a deal .  I do n't really like being at college .  I mean .  it 's fun .  And there are n't any rules , but .  I really miss everything about my home .  And I do n't mean like , home as in my house .  I 've gone back there and it 's totally different .  It does n't seem like I belong there .  And I guess I do n't .  That 's what this is all about .  I do n't like this assignment .  It 's making be sadder than I was to begin with .  Is that the point ?  I really like my psych class .  My calculus class on the other hand .  sucks !  A whole bunch .  Not only is it at 9 ( which is an hour that I do n't do ) , but the guy I seriously think is making things up !  I can type pretty fast .  I wonder if this is going to fit in the little box .  I do n't type that fast , but I mean .  it looked like a pretty small box .

1331,"Okay , I 'm starting .  I did assignments like this in freshman English back in high school .  It was pretty cool .  Mrs.  Johnson was a great English teacher , but she scared me sometimes , like when she would yell at one of the kids in class to prove a point about what we were learning in class .  I really liked that class .  I liked the books we read .  We were reading Huckleberry Finn , and one of her points she made was over censorship , she took the book away from us .  We could n't even go to the school library to finish it .  I guess she got her point across .  Another point she made was no matter how little time given for an assignment , you can get it done .  Before we read Animal Farm , she split us up into groups , sheep , pigs , dogs , chicken , and we had to have a campaign .  This just was n't any campaign , we really had to work for it .  Make up slogans , flyers , songs , costumes , bribes .  you name , we were graded on it .  We were allowed to decorate all the halls with our flyers .  It became really big , Mrs.  Johnson and her campaigns .  It just kept getting bigger every year .  I guess you could say the incoming freshman were getting crazier each year .  I did n't really care , each year that went by was closer to me getting away from there .  I ca n't stand it back home .  I knew everybody in my school , and they all knew me , so tell my how I ended up with only a handful of people who would talk with me during lunch .

Many times we try to obtain success at all costs ; even at the cost of our own happiness and well being .  Students feel pressure from many sources .  Many of those sources are our parents .  They feel pressure to be a success in their parents eyes no matter what the costs .  Even if the costs includes the well being of their self .  This is a sad occurrence .  We should be encouraged by our parents .  Their is a thin line between encouraging and pressuring .  We look for that line and do our best to walk as close to it as possible .

Oh well .  It 's really cold in here , but it always is .  I really should n't be getting distracted by the temperature in here .  I should be more worried about the EE test that I have to take this semester or the CS class that I have to pass , although neither of them are weighing on my mind with the magnitude that they should .  I 'm begging to miss surfing again .  I thought that the three weeks home this summer would help cure me of my love of the ocean , but it did n't .  It never does .  I need to be playing guitar more also .  I 've let it slip quite a bit here lately .  I know the reason for that , I 've let myself get too distracted with the girls around me .  I allow them too much power over my life , and my actions .  But that 's ok because I 'm done with all of that .  I 'm really going to try to cut my ties to all of what is negative in my life .  Well at least as far as my friends go .  I 've begun to realize more and more how much people use me .  The funny part of it is they all think that they 're getting away with something , when in fact I 'm quite aware of what is going on around me and what is happening to me .  I guess I just give people to much damn credit .  That 's another thing I 'm over .  Despite how much I say I do n't want those people in my life I know that I crave them being there due to my own insecurities and my need to have other gay people around me .  But why the hell to I feel the need to have those gay people around me ?  They end up making me feel more ostracized than accepted .  I 'll never become what they see as normal .  For that matter , I do n't want to become that .  I do n't want to go out and sleep around , and do the drugs and all that other crap .  It just occurred to me that who ever reads this will think that I 'm writing this solely to seem like some good kid , yeah right .  I 'm not , but then again , they 'll never know that .  I find this assignment odd .  I 'd love to read what other students write , and more importantly I 'd love to know how much of it is truly stream of conscious writing and how much of it is just premeditated butt kissing .  Once again something I 'm sure I 'll never know .  But sure enough something I 'll ponder for at least a little while .  I 'm sure I 'll be able to use that as an intricate procrastination method when I should be studying for one of the many classes that I 'm taking this semester which are surely going to kill me .  Man , I meant to pay my phone bill today .  I 've got to do that tomorrow .  My credit is going to be so screwed .  I 've screwed up so bad as far as money goes this past few years , well actually it 's been this past year .  I just do n't even like to think about money .  It makes me sick to my stomach every time I think about it .  If I were the least bit intelligent I would learn to budget or even better yet keep a check book like a normal person but oh no.  God , there 's that damn word again , "" normal "" .  I 've come to despise that word .  It seems like everywhere I turn I 'm being bombarded with it , and what 's worse is the fact that no matter who 's throwing it at me I 'm not fitting it .  I just hate that word .  Who 's right is it to decided weather or not I 'm normal .  Who gets to decide what is normal .  I think that 's what I want to be when I grow up .  the one who decides what 's normal .  No I do n't want to do that , changed my mind .  I do n't want to put any more labels into this world than already exists .  Speaking of things I 've got to do soon , I need to change my oil .  Since Chris and I drove to Dallas yesterday that put me nearly 200 miles where I was supposed to change it .  I used to never let it get that far over .  School has become such a distraction to my life .  I know it 's bad when my parents keep telling me that I 'm working too hard and taking school too serious .  I guess it all goes back to working hard at school as being a way of running away from everything else .  It 's just so much easier to come up to the library and work , and at least do something productive , rather than sitting around and dwelling over the drama and crap that exits in my life .  Most of which I ca n't do a damn thing about .  That 's another thing I need to work on accepting what I can change and what I ca n't .  I seem to get it in my mind that I solve the problems of the world .  Before I do that I need to get my own life straightened out .

It is such a home to me .  My best friends are from my church .  It is so sad that I will never be in a youth group again as a youth .  I ay end up going on trips as a sponsor or something but it will never be the same .  I 'm at somewhat of peace with the change but it still makes me sad when I realize the little things like not having to rush around on Sundays in order to be back for choir , supper , and bible study .  The things that can drive you crazy are the things you miss.  I miss my cat .  He is so old .  I remember when he was a tiny baby in 1988 .  He find us and adopted us .  We named him Kitty Duke after Michael Dukakis ' wife who we were voting for that year ( it was Election time ) but soon found that he was a he so we changed it to Duke .  Everyone says that it sounds like a big dog 's name but oh well .  He is an orange tabby cat .  It seems like he used to be fatter but maybe I 've just gotten bigger .  We 've been through a lot .  W e used to play together all the time .  I 'd sing to him when he was a baby .  Without my brother I would be such a different person .  He has helped form me in so many ways .  He is my hero .  I think the world of him .  I did n't always though , like when he would hit me on the head or do "" gross "" things in my face as a normal big brother should do .  But I 'm very lucky to be so close to him .  I try not to talk about him around Caitlyn , Jake 's little sister .  When he died she was in 4th grade .  They were so close .  I remember it all like it was yesterday .  Getting the call at 6 the next morning .  I had seen hi that Sunday night that he died at church and I remember him giving me that half smile that he did and me melting along with the rest of the girls in youth group .  I talked to Catilyn about it for the first time this summer since it happened when she was in fourth grade .  She broke down one night in Montana when we were on mission tour .  We were all sharing what something meant to us and several people ended up relating it to their siblings .  She just broke down which was a first .  I talked to her and told her that I hated talking about Seth around her because Jake and him were the same age .  She said that she loved hearing about Seth but she just wished that she had an older brother so badly .  She said it like any other person who had never had a brother would say it .  My brother is getting married this summer .  It is so strange .  I love Lauren .  She is already just like my sister .  They have been together for four years now .  At first I was so jealous because I felt like she was taking my place as my brother 's best friend .  I soon realized that we had very different places in Seth 's life and that there is room for both of us .  I have Seth ' past and we both have his future .  My Family and I used to drive to our cabin in east Texas and have the best time .  Seth and I would play so hard .  On the way down we would always eat at the same fast food place and get burgers and icecream .  Seth would always comment on the fresh air as soon as we got out of the car in the woods .

1425,"Well , I suppose since this is a stream of consciousness exercise I will just say whatever is on my mind , which at the moment happens to be how incredibly horrible this past weekend was .  But , let 's back up and get the basics down .  For graduation , my grandparents promised to buy me a new computer .  New , being the operative word .  So they told me to go find one that I liked and tell them where it was .  My mother and I went out and looked at computers and found a nice setup that included a printer for about $ 1500 .  We thought that sounded reasonable , so we informed my grandparents of the computer 's location and they said it sounded good .  HOWEVER , they went to see my Uncle 's family in Dallas for my cousin 's birthday and decided to go a cheaper route and not buy a namebrand computer .  So I ended up with this piece of crap that keeps shutting down on me .  My Dad has been freaking out for the past two weeks how he knew all along we should have gotten a different computer in the first place and how my grandparents always go the cheaper route even when it means less quality and now my entire college career is jeopardized because I can not get online .  So I spent Saturday messing with my computer , trying to reinstall stuff to see if it was a software problem .  It was n't .  My Uncle drove in from Dallas on Sunday and took Windows off , reinstalled it , deleted my C drive ( which is a big deal ) , then created a new one and repartitioned it , Everything SEEMED to work for a brief period of time before my computer decided to do one more mad little dance of irony and shut itself down .  Now I am stuck with a computer that does n't even partially compute and my Dad has to come pick it up to take it to some store called "" Computer Doctor "" and meanwhile he 's still ranting about how he was right all along and my Mother should talk my grandparents into getting me a new computer , and if they do n't how my parents should because if they do n't I 'm going to flunk because after all everything is online nowadays , etc.  So I wasted my weekend sitting up in my room with my family when I could have been in the music room practicing .  And I 'm a music major , not computer science , so the music building is where I should be .  But my mother would n't let me go to the music building because she wanted me to be around while they were messing with my computer .  So I did n't practice AT ALL this weekend when my professor says I should practice 4 hours a day at least , and I just got a bunch of new music and now I 'm totally screwed for my lesson on Friday .  I also am having trouble in my music theory class because my teacher never bothered to tell me what an augmented interval or a diminished interval is , and they expect us to learn this stuff in one night , and since we have the class everyday , it 's not like we can procrastinate at all .  It 's very frustrating .  or maybe it 's just me .  I do n't know .  All I know is that I have n't even typed for ten minutes yet and I 'm still complaining .  It 's not like I usually procrastinate about anything anyway .  I mean , I was valedictorian of my high school , I think I know something about time management .  Although , being valedictorian of my school was no terrible feat .  I went to all the parties and pulled all the typical high school stunts , and had the highest number of "" unexcused absences "" you could have without being held back .  And I wrote my speech at three in the morning the day of graduation .  So I guess I know a little about procrastination anyway .

I used to write a lot when I was younger and planned on becoming a writer .  I stopped at about the 6th grade because that is when I began to focus more on school .  I think that middle schools and especially high schools place too much emphasis on grades .  Those institutions should be places for students to WANT to learn , but now it 's all competition and people care less about what they actually learn and get out of the class and care way too much about whether they get an A in the class .

1446,"Last night around 11pm or so a friend of mine from high school came knocking at my door .  She told me that a guy I went to high school with had just committed suicide on Friday .  Apparently he had a fight with his parents about his drug abuse ( which I had no idea was even an issue with him ) and he stormed out of the house .  No one knew where he was so they went looking for him .  They found his body by a creek in a neighborhood near mine ( some of my friends still live there , too ) .  It still has n't hit me yet .  I have been at school with him since the first grade .  I know that at the funeral , it will definitely hit me .  After last year I thought everything was going to be better .  At the beginning of the school year ( actually the summer before my senior year ) Kyle committed suicide by hanging himself .  After getting over that , Will was killed in a car accident .  After coping with Will 's death , I thought nothing else was going to happen .  I mean , two deaths ( not to mention the death of teacher ) happened within the span of about three or so months .  The rest of my year was going great until April .  That was when I found out that one of the girls who I had been best friends with in elementary and junior high had committed suicide .  She overdosed on her medication and died in her sleep .  I could n't believe it .  For years I would talk to her and hang with her and played sports with her all through middle school .  Going to her funeral was the hardest thing that I have EVER had to do .  I cried the minute I got there and did n't stop crying until days later .  Seeing her parents made it even harder .  I mean what can you say to them .  Nothing you could ever come up with could make them feel any better .  Nothing could make you feel any better either .  She had an open casket , so as we walked out after the service was over , we had to pass by her .  I absolutely and completely fell apart .  I could n't see where I was going I was crying so hard .  Even now as I am writing this assignment I 'm getting tearyeyed .  I still do n't understand ( and I probably never will ) why anyone could take their life like that .  I mean , do n't they know how many people need them , how many people depend on them , or how many people just love them for who they are and how they make us feel when we 're around them .  Marshall is the second one to kill themselves from my elementary/junior high school .  Everyone always talks about how things like that come in three 's .

1448,"So here are twenty minutes of Brian 's thoughts .  As I sit here , I am dumbfounded by the ignorance of humans .  Today I talked to a coworker about religion .  He found out that I 'm agnostic and proceeded to proselytize .  I can respect this , because his religion dictates that people who do n't accept Jesus Christ will go to hell .  But at the same time , I poked several holes in the Christian philosophy and in the Bible .  He was n't able to counter my arguments , and he responded only by saying that he has faith .  This epitomizes human ignorance .  I have faith the chair I 'm sitting in now will not collapse and harm me .  This faith is based on my past experiences with chairs and with seeing things that turn out to , in fact , exist .  Yet he claims he has "" faith "" in a god that nobody on this planet can prove they 've seen .  I can just as well assert via faith that there is a Pink Elephant on the other side of the moon that we 'll never see .  I 've never seen this elephant , but I KNOW it 's there .  I have faith .  It speaks to me through the Elephant Spirit .  What the fuck is that all about ?  How can someone bastardize his or her beliefs to knowledge like this ? ?  It is incomprehensible to me .  I realize that people have a deepseated need for absolutes .  Nobody wants to think our planet is a lonely hunk of dirt floating in space , so instead we conjure up deities that give our lives and our very existence meaning .  Never mind that there is absolutely no reason to believe we are correct save a book compiled thousands of years ago based on events hundred or thousands of years before that !  Who needs logic and reason anyway ?  And it never ceases to amaze me that some scientists still embrace religion !  It scares me how easy it is for them to walk away from work and into church and never mingle the two because they 're so incompatible .  It makes me truly sad that people can be so stupid .  Thankfully our society is progressing further and further away from religion , albeit at a crawling pace .  And even so , rather than shedding this relic of our intellectual infancy we simply mold the religion ( absolute truth , mind you ) to fit our current society and way of life .  I 'm dumbfounded .  It also amazes me how closedminded people can be .  I 'm gay .  Big deal .  Yet many people ( though a few proportion in Austin ) perceive me as evil for it .  My actions are vile and disgusting to them .  Never mind the fact that homosexual activity occurs in nature , though not as frequently as heterosexual behavior .  And do n't even touch upon the fact that there is no logical , reasonable justification for opposing homosexuality .  People have all these notions that homosexuals are pedophiles or that we try to "" recruit .  "" At the risk of sounding pessimistic in my writing and thoughts , I ca n't believe how moronic our society is , on average .  We even have Al Gore in the news saying he opposes samesex marriage based on religious reasons .  ( Hmm , are my two pet peeves of the day related ?  Of course ! )  J.  And so I 'm left sitting here , wondering how people can be so stupid as to embrace Christianity and oppose homosexuality .  Ugh .  THESE are the times that try men 's ( and women 's ) souls !  Which brings up another point .  I 'm so annoyed at how misogynistic our society is .  The craze in the past decade has been political correctness , and conservatives are sick of it .  But things have n't changed nearly as much as people think .  I still sit through lectures where the professor refers to every character described ( a banker , an investor , a CEO ) as he .  he .  he .  I ca n't stand it .  But perhaps it 's not so much that these professors are bigoted to some degree .  Perhaps they 're simply trying to convey the way the world really is !  Because women do n't have anywhere near an equitable stake in society .

Also it seems as if school is not that big of a deal to my friends it bothers me because I do n't like school either but I still have to do it .",0,18,2,0,0,0,0,0,2,9,28,1,3,0,5,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,66,0

1484,"I 'm realizing , as I begin to write this , that this psychology assignment is probably the weirdest thing I 've ever had to do for a class .  On one hand , it seems utterly useless , but then again , I know nothing about psychology , so I 'm fascinated to find out how they can use something like this for scientific purposes .  I just got my wind ensemble music about half an hour ago , and I 'm already nervous .  I 'm also really hungry .  I should be meeting Ashley for lunch right now in Kinsolving , but I 'm doing this assignment instead .  Hope she 's not mad .  I do n't think she will be .  Christina wanted to eat over there anyway , and I 'd like to try their food , so we 'll probably go over there for lunch .  Maybe not dinner .  I have rehearsal tonight for LHB .  Dang it .  The last thing I feel like doing right now is marching .  It 's so hot .  I really miss Doug .  He 's been on my mind every once in awhile , ever since I started school .  I do n't know why I think about him so much .  I 've tried to deal with these feelings before , and they 've gotten better , but only a little bit .  I think of him as a friend , but a part of me still likes him a lot .  I do n't know why .  I should know better .  He 's the last person I 'd ever want to date .  But maybe that 's why I like him so much , that whole "" opposites attract "" theory .  I do n't know .  Actually , it 's not that I do n't want to date him , but he has so many qualities that I should n't like .  When I think about his friendship with Carolyn , it always stirs up jealousy inside me .  I know I should n't get jealous of her .  They were such good friends more than friends for awhile , and there 's no reason that I should mean as much , or more , to him than she does .  I should be happy for them .  I love carolyn .  She 's one of my best friends , but at the same time , she drives me crazy .  I do n't think she realizes how much it hurts me when she talks about how sweet doug is to her and everything .  I wish she 'd just make up her mind between him and zag .  But the more I think about it , the more I do n't miss all that crap from high school .  I know there are going to be other guys that I meet I already have met several in LHB but it 's just that I do n't know anyone well yet .  There 's nobody that I can just talk to , or sit beside and listen to them talk , like I did with Doug .  I really miss those times when he 'd play with my hair or hold my hand or stroke my cheek .  All the times carolyn was n't around .  Weird .  No , I need to stop thinking like this .  What did my book say ?  I 'm supposed to wait for God to put someone in my life .  I should n't go chasing after guys ( like Carolyn does ) because that 'll only get me hurt .  I try so hard to be good and do what my Christian friends say , but I guess it 's that human nature that makes me want to do the other things .

1506,"Urg !  There is sand in my sandal .  It 's been there for a while now .  It was so annoying that I had to take my shoes off while I was driving home from my horrendously long art class today .  I had to wait for half an hour for that stupid bus .  It was at least 6:45 by the time I reached my stop .  You 'd think that rush hour would be over by then .  It was n't .  I sat in traffic from Enfield all the way out past the Y at 290 .  That is just insane .  I was stuck behind a maroon jeep cherokee with a Gore/Liberman bumpersticker on it for most of the way .  But that guy exited when I got to the 290/Mopac split .  Then I was confused as a white Rav 4 started diving through lanes into spaces too absurd to drive in .  It was quite odd and annoying all at the same time .  Then I was almost cut off by a stupid woman in a red mini-van and her punk looking son .  I 'll just say this : I was ready for this day to end at about 2:00 this afternoon .  Now it 's getting cold in here .  My dad 's office is always cold .  Of course , his computer is always on .  It 's a giant that 's hardly ever used .  Shame really .  So my feet are starting to get quite chilly .  More of the usual discomfort .  The smell in here is rather interesting .  It smells like candy .  Cherry candy to be precise .  For a moment I thought my boyfriend might be eating some of the lollypops my dad always has on his desk .  He was n't though .  Odd .  It 's really not that usual for an automotive shop office to be smelling like candy .  There are too many boxes at my feet .  It 's hard to get comfortable with all of them at my feet .  I keep mentioning my feet .  Why is that ?  They 're uncomfortable , that could be one reason .  I feel bad because I have been sort of brusque with my boyfriend .  Here he is , come all the way from across town just to see me and I ca n't even spare him five minutes before I launch into my homework .  I think I 'll give him a hug now .  Just a minute .  I think he appreciated that .  It was a necessary break in my stream of consciousness .  He gives so much of his time to me , the least I can do is give him some back in return .  Sometimes I wonder why he is so loyal .  I tend to rush past him when I 'm doing something or I overlook him when he wants my attention .  He really dose n't deserve that .  He 's such a nice person .  I always tell him that I 'm a mean person and that he would be better off with someone prettier and nicer .  He just smiles and hugs me and tells me there is no one better .  I have my doubts , but I really do n't think I 'd give him up if someone better were to come along .  I 'd fight to the death to keep him .  That 's how much I love him .  I 'm a very jealous person .  I 'm stingy with my boyfriend and I 'm stingy with my friends .  I do n't like anyone being around him ( mostly females ) if I 'm not there too .  I know I should n't be so difficult , but it 's not really something I have any conscious control over .  I do n't like my sister being around my friends either .  I hate sharing friends with her .  She 's younger than I am and she has her own friends to hang out with .

I know that I will have to get something very soon because I can smell the food that my friend is eating over there in the corner .  I smells sooooo good that my stomach feels like it will never stop making the noises that it is making until I give some food to it .  I feel sort of tired at this point in the day .  I have just recently finished all of my classes which begin early in the morning and do not finish until late in the afternoon .  That is sort of a good thing because I get a big break in the middle of the day , but I would rather get my school day over with early so that I could do homework at any time that I want to instead of being forced to do it right after class .  The reason that I have a schedule that is this way is because I went to one of the last sessions of orientation and I did not get the times for the classes that I wanted .  Right now my eyes are sort of getting tired because I am not used to typing for this many minutes straight without a single break .  Usually when I type I will take a lot of breaks and I will waste a lot of time that I should not be wasting .

One girl in the class said , Who cares ! !  People die every day ! !  We kill people in Afganistan every day and we do n't hold memorials for them ! !  I personally was outraged by that comment .  How disrespectful for her to say that on a day like that .  That night I went with my friends to the memorial at the tower .  We stayed for a couple minutes and then proceeded to walk to the capital building for the memorial that was held there .  It was awesome .  To be standing there next to my friends , people that I loved , and listen to the songs and here the speeches was very emotional .  To hear the bagpipes play and see the fireman and the policeofficers .  And then a fire man talked about how when they lose a fireman they ring the firebell , so they did that .

1528,"This is the second paper I have written like this because somehow the other one disappeared right when I was trying to push the Finish button .  It seems like my life is always going the wrong way or I have bad luck such as this for most of the time .  I did just get through working out with my Tae-bo tape .  After completing that I always feel 100 % better about myself and problems . I guess you could say that is how I deal with all of my stress , even though my life is not all that bad .  Whenever someone thinks their life is terrible I always think about those children that you see on television that are starving or sick .  I do n't know why but I whenever I see a homeless person on the street I immediately feel sorry for them but then I start to think about why they do n't have a job or are not in a shelter .  My mind goes back and fourth like that a lot .  Austin has a lot of homeless and I am so not used to that atmosphere , that is partly why I do n't like living here .  And because my boyfriend wants me to come back closer to where he lives which is Dallas , where I live as well .  I chose Austin and UT because a lot of people told me that I should not go here , including my boyfriend .  That just made me want to come even more though , dispite the fact that I could tell at orientation that I was not going to like it .  My boyfriend is very important to me though because I have dated him for 4 years and we have a really special relationship .",0,28,8,0,0,0,0,0,1,9,21,3,13,0,6,16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,10,87,0

1533,"Right now i am simply writing and not feeling anything in particular .  I am somewhat upset right now though because my throat is hurting , and this is due to the fact that i have started smoking a lot more than usual .  I am a pretty sensitive person so i think that is why it hurts .  who knows .  I also am feeling a little unmotivated at the moment and i ca n't figure out why .  This is the time in life when i am supposed to be super juiced to go out and get what i want , to grab life by the horns so to speak .  This is not happening though , and it is kind of scary .  Throughout my life i have been pretty much handed everything i have either through the mediocrity of others or through my own natural abilities , or a combination of both .  It scares me to think that i have never applied myself fully to anything that i have ever done , and have still managed a somewhat successful , although underachieving , life .  It makes me wonder a few things though about myself and what i have in store for the rest of my life .  I do n't know if i actually know how to apply myself fully to something , and if i do will i actually be able to stop and apply it to something else .  This not only applies to me with work and school but also with personal relationships .  Up to this point I have many friends , but very few whom i can actually call close friends .  They are just there because of attrition or because i was what some people might call popular in high school .  I was n't popular because of my stunning personality though , but more of what i was ; a basketball player , an intelligent person , and somewhat goodlooking .  When i got to college and found that there are hundreds if not thousands of people like this i found out that i am not at all who i thought .  I do n't really know who i am and who im not , and i am kind of scared to try to find out .  When i finally decide what i am will i like it ?  Will anyone else like me ?  Will it make me happy or will i learn to hate myself because i disdain the person that i actually am .  They say that you can be whoever you want but this is not true .  You can TRY to be whoever you want but for some reason you can not always be this way because there is something deep down inside of you that knows better .",0,30,4,0,0,0,0,0,5,7,23,3,16,0,7,38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,0,0,6,95,2

I think I really want to quit smoking also because I can feel how much it is taking its toll on my health .  I think another reason why today was difficul to get through was because I am still very sore from rugby practice that was last night .  Finally we are getting into the scrimaging and off of such concentration on the fundamentals of the game .  There are only so many times that I can sit and do the same drills over and over .

Of course I got there late for my discussion group so I got the bottom of the barrell when signing up for a presentation topic and the only one left was for Monday .  But that is so my luck .

I really want to work for MTV .  I know many people must think of this as a childish fantasy , but it is really something I am serious about and want to persue .

I am living with a friend from back home that is a sophomore here .  I did n't know anyone here when I came so I decided to go through the rush process and go greek .  I was very disappointd in the greek system .  They are so political here in Austin .  I felt like I was cheated out of a few good sororities because my parents did n't go greek in college or did not have as much money as other girls going through rush .  A lot of the legacy stuff did n't make sense to me .  Oh well , I ended up pledging Alpha ChiOmega and I absolutely love it !  The sweetest girls in the owrld are in there and they are so much fun !  I have made many friendships that will last for a lifetime already .  Right now my roomate and her boyfriend went to eat and I am typing this for my new psych class .  I am listening to a song from back home that makes me miss my x boyfriend .  We were together for the past year and I was so in love with him , but he was 21 and I was 18 and that 's not a bad age difference , but he just wanted to party all of the time , which is okay , but he drank every night we were together and that really upset me .  That also led into him lying to me and doing things behind my back that really hurt so I broke up with him .  But I still miss him so much .  But moving to Austin is a good thing for me because I am away from everyithing from back home and I can start all over .  He was n't good for me at the time .  Hompefully he will grow out of his drinking stage and maybe someday we will wokr everything out , but until then I am not putting up with that and i can do better .

Its knda crazy becasue I am from Pottsboro , an hour north of dallas , she is from Plano , and he is from Prosper .  I met Jacob at the lake when I was modeling for a swimsuit store .  We fell in love and spent the next year together .  ANyways , i have been knda upset with my parents lately because they are just really frustrating me .

They are so worried that I am just down here partying and not going to class .  I do n't know why they think that because coming to UT has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl !  I am so happy here !  My mom got upset with me last night becasue i told her I was going to the Tulane vs. Texas game in New Orleans and she said no , and I said well I 'm old enought to make my own decisions now .  Why would she not want me to go on a roadtrip with all my new sorority sisters and have fun ?

It is probally the caffeine that is keeping me up .  I am also feeling extremely stressed out at the moment .  I went through rush and became a pledge in a sorority that I love .  I went through the whole process by my self .  Unlike many other girls , my parents did not really help me , or even want me to .  Now that I have become a member , we are accpted to pay a lot of money and my parents are telling me we do not have it .  It is extremely frusterating because they are being complety unsupportive .  I told them that I would get a job and they said that if my grades suffered then I would have to quit the sorority and the job , but since they are not offering to pay much money towards it , what exactly is it that they want me to do ? ?  I am also extremely frusterated that I do not have a computer yet .  I am in the college of education , and I ordered an ibook from the UT computer store .  When I placed the order , they told me it would take up to two weeks for the computer to be in .  It has been a week and a half so far .  I called the store today and the lady was extremely rude and said that it usually takes three weeks for a customer to receive their product .  I am using my roomate 's computer at the moment , and although she says that she does not mind , I feel bad constantly using it , and I would just be more comfortable if I had my own .  I also feel sick .  I have had a sore and extremely scratchy throat for what feels like weeks now .  I never seem to get better .  One day I might feel a little more lively and energetic but the next day I will just feel worse .  You know , I am usually not this pessimistic .  In fact I am proud of the fact that I am so optimistic , however at this moment , right now , I just have a lot of problems and a lot of stuff to be upset about .  The whole cost of my sorority is really stressing me out .  I know that my parents want me to quit , they were hinting at it on the phone last night , but I just do not want to .  It is something that I have gone through , and it is something that I enjoy .  I am the first person on either side of my family to have joined either a sorority or a fraternity , and I would like to uphold this .  I would like to prove to them that their is nothing wrong with it .  My family can sometimes be close minded and I would like to be the first one to open up their mind on this idea .  Lets see , so I do n't sound like a depressed , basket case , let me think of the positive aspects in my life right now .  To begin , I absolutely and completely am in love with college .  I love my dorm , I like my roomates and my suitemates and all of the people that live in my hall .  I have already established some awesome friendships and I know that as the year progresses , they will only blossom .  I like my classes .  I mean school is school , but the classes I am taking are somewhat interesting to me , and I do not really mind studying these subjects .  I am in the college of education ; I want to be an elementary school teacher , and I am very much looking foward to that .  I can not wait to begin working with children .  I love kids .  I would like to have four someday .  Preferabally two girls and two boys , but it is not like I would not be happy with whatever I get .  I am from Austin , and my parents and my two younger sisters live about fifteen minutes away .",0,23,6,0,0,0,0,0,2,13,30,2,15,0,8,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,8,101,6
1557,"Okay , I thought right now would be the best time to do this .  I 'm alone and can think aobut what 's going on .  These last couple of weeks and been great as in school wise but my personal life has been shitty .  We got into a wreck where alcohol was involved and the thing was the driver was designated and had nothing to drink and it was the other guys fault .  Somehow with our parents we though we could cover it up aobut the alcohol but they found out aobut everything .  This is all that keeps playing over and over right now .  Where did we mess up ?  Well the past is the past and you ca n't change it .  My dad came down and was very disappointed .  He did n't know I had been drinknig for 1 and half years now and I do n't evne get drunk .  I get a buzz and I 'm good .  I have a few drinks every now and then not even all the time .  For some reason he does n't beleive it .  He was furious .  He 's always trusted me for everything and never thought I 'd mess up like this .  I do good in school graduated top 2 % of my class and everything .  I have always done good in school and put school first jsut like my parents taught me too .  I never wanted to disappoint my parents .  I kept it so none of my little mess-ups would ever reach them .  So they would think of me as they saw me everyday .  This last senior year I started going to parties and hanging out with different people .  I 'm a real easy going person .  The way I think is that I do n't care aobut anything .  I let things happen .  I make the decisions that I think are right at the time and let whatever happen .  I like to make people happy .  I 'm one of those people that when someone is arguing aobut something I let them argue and win .  If they think they are right than they feel good .  As for me I do n't care .  I know I 'm right or wrong and I let it be , as lngo as their happy it 's all good .  So aobut the drinknig I have no idea what lead me to it .  I used to be a very shy and not really outgonig person .  Everyone liked me but I never tlaked oir anything but people knew me just because I was the only Indian at my school and I was easy gonig and friendly .  I hate no one , I think everyone has a good side as long as they do n't screw me over .  Once someone screws me over than I do n't like them but until then I try to get along with everyone .  Well I guess that 's why I staretd drinkngi to get my shyness away .  Very bad excuse , I know .  My dad thinks it 's peer pressure .",0,32,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,6,63,3,13,0,6,46,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,18,131,2

The idea was to paint each one different , but to have the same motif .  It was harder to come up with an idea than I thought it would be .

My dad is very upset with my cat because while I have been away , she has gone to the bathroom on lots of his important papers .  She only does that when she is upset about something .  I guess she misses me .  We used to have a cocker spaniel named lady , but we had to get her put to sleep a while back .  She was a wonderful dog .  I am bringing my fish back with me when I go back to Austin tomorrow .  That is the only kind of pet we can have in the dorm .  I had to sell my horse before I left for college .

No , I take that back , I 'm not that hungry .  I could eat but it 's not to the point where I feel like I have to eat .  My friend and I are going to lunch today .  I 'm so glad that I 've made a friend that I can hang out with and talk to all the time .  It 's not the same like my friends at home though .  I miss Melissa and Amber .

1563,"Today is September 10 , the day before our new monumental rememberence day of September 11th .  I sometimes wonder if tomorrow there will be another attack on the United States .  It is weird to think that anything could happen tomorrow and we ca n't do anything about it .  I still remember like it was yesterday watching the September 11th terrorist attack not knowing what will happen to the United STates .  I really hope that we can prevent anything from happening tomorrow .  Now that I am a freshman at the University of Texas things are beginging to change .  For instance , my boyfriend and I are on a break , whatever that means .  He does n't like me only seeing him when it is convinient for me to hang out .  He 's a junior at St.  Edwards University and has done the whole new college experience already .  It is hard for him to not see me as much as this summer .  I think it is that I really want to go out and meet new people .  Getting to know the girls at my dorm in Kinsolving is really fun , and I like hanging out with them on the weekends .  Of course this means going to parties with other boys there , and this does n't make my boyfriend very happy .  I can totally understand because I wouldnt want him to hang out with all girls at a party , but I have to do the whole college experience right ?  Well anyway now that we are broken up , I realize how much I miss him and how much I do n't want to end things .  It 's weird how when it 's time to go to sleep or study that is all I can think about .  He 's so cute and perfect , I do n't know what I am screwing up .  It 's hard trying to balance your time here now that I am in college .  There is always something to do , and I love that , but I need to concentrate on studying and keeping myself on track .  I guess in high school that courses could be made not as difficult , and deadlines were not so final , as long as you could persuade the teacher .  College is a blast and I love my roomate .

1566,"When I first heard about our first writing assignment , I figured it would be very difficult because I am used to writing about a specified subject matter .  But hopefully I can take up these 20 minutes by talking my day or how I feel .  Actually , I think I 'd like to start out by expressing my thoughts about the pre-testing we were required to do .  It was amazing at how some of the questions completely reflected me or something that I might feel or think .  I also learned a little about myself , my self-esteem , and my self-confidence .  Well , I do n't have much of either ( self-esteem / self-confidence ) .  Hopefully , by living by myself and taking care of things here in Austin I will develop these traits .  When I first came to college , it was very terrifying because all my life my family and friends have always been with me and even taken care of things for .  I almost had no experience about ' living on my own ' and ' taking care of myself .  ' I mean , I knew how to do my laundry and the essentials , but when it came to asking others questions or figuring stuff on my own , I was not able to do it .  For example , I had n't even ordered pizza by myself !  So I naturally hesitated to call up the pizza guy because I was n't sure of what sizes or deals they had .  But I quickly learned here , that YOU have to take initiative and most importantly , no question is stupid .  In fact , the question I probably ask , someone else might benefit from it .  So I think I have grown a great deal in that aspect while here in college .  In addition , I would always do everything with my friends .  And upon coming to Austin , I feel/felt very lonely because all my close friends have gone to other colleges .",0,13,5,0,0,0,0,0,1,10,8,2,12,0,3,16,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,24,55,0

I really need to find out where the Fine Arts library is so I can do this gay reading list .  I do n't even have a clear understanding of what I 'm supposed to do .  I assume I just have to look at some art and write down my feelings about it or something .  It is really annoying becuase the class is already 4 hours long .  There should not be any outside work , but I guess it 's not too hard , and if there are not any set boundaries there is n't any set grading material , this means that it is basically completion , much like this assignment .  I really want to go to the Texas Ski Ranch tommorrow but I ca n't find anyone to go and it is like an hour away and it will probably take longer because of traffic because the only time I could leave would be around 5:30 .

159,""" Stream of Consciousness "" Everyday about now , I am still sleeping .  I feel good just having barely six hours of sleep .  I thought I would be feeling more tired and exhausted , but It has not hit me yet .  This morning , while watching CNN , and still seeing the coverage of Princess Diana , made me sad .  It makes me think why everyone in that crash died and the bodyguard did not .  He had ten hours of surgery .  What pain I thought .  I kept on asking myself why did G-d let him live .  Why not someone like Princess Diana who did so much for the world and has two young boys to help grow up .  She did so much for other people .  She even raffled her dresses of for charity .  What a women .  I 'm feeling a little bit tired now .  The psy experiment I did today was a fun experiment .  I enjoyed it .  I sat next to a cute girl .  I hope today 's classes will go fast .  I would like to take a nap today .  Just to sleep and rest for an hour .  It was nice seeing one of my brothers in my fraternity on campus today .  It was a nice surprise .  Also , I saw one of my friends from home on campus .  It is exciting walking home from campus or going a different route because of the unexpected people you see or new or old friends you see .  My mother went on business and I hope she is doing well .  I hope she got well rested today .  I hope to talk with my sister and she how well she is doing .  I try to put myself in a better mood everyday .  I think about a lot of things and it gets me worried .  An example is I worry about friends , family , grades , whether I am behind or do n't understand something in a class .  I also do not like change .  I do n't like a change in atmosphere or any change whatsoever .  Like going home this summer was hard because of a change in atmosphere and a change in obeying my parents again with a curfew etc.  I try to get along with all my fraternity brothers , but sometimes I feel it is harder than normal .  I spoke with my mother and she says you ca n't be friends with everyone .  I have so much to thank for but I feel that I am always asking G-d to help me in a situation .  I enjoy life and enjoy the pleasures it gives me .  I enjoy school and friends .  I feel everyone has there moods and their times they feel good and bad .  I had a very rough summer due to the fact that I had irritable bowel syndrome .  It was very painful and I did not like the pain .  A doctor prescribed me some medication .  What upsets me is that one of my friends I feel is rude at times .  I feel this because last night he was rude when I went to his room and he started yelling that I was disturbing his speech .  I continue to be nice to him .  I am always debating whether or not to be nice to him .  He can be nice at times , but a jerk at other times .  I feel that he maybe insecure and have no real friends .  Sometimes I 'm angry at him and sometimes I 'm not .  Sometimes I feel sorry for him and sometimes I do n't .  I walked into my fraternity house this morning and saw our cleaning man .  The fraternity buys all his children gifts for Christmas and I think it 's nice .  Sometimes I feel sorry for him .  He is a nice man .  I also feel sad sometimes because I wish the relationship with me and my father would be better .  I do not get along with him very well .  Sometimes I get very upset thinking about it .  I often thank G-d that I have an excellent relationship with my mother and my uncle and sister .  I miss my dog .  He is so cute .  I did n't spend that much time with him this summer and forgot to ask my parents how he is doing .  Usually I hear him barking when I am on the phone with my parents , but I have not heard him recently .  When I visit home in a couple of weekends , I would like to spend a little time with him .  He is a very nice and loving pet .  He is old but still wild .  I hope my girlfriend comes home with me .",0,30,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,19,75,2,7,0,7,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5,2,0,0,0,14,146,2

I learned last night in my meditation class that love is the key to everyones happiness , or anunda .  Everyone desires love ; everyone wants to find and experience love .  And once found , then nothing can become a barrier .  But for me it is my parents money that is a barrier .  I 've never been on my own , and they are paying for everything right now .  They pay for my apartment , schooling , books , and they give me a sum of money to live off of .  I doubt that if I wanted to be a full time student that I would be able to have the luxuries that I do now , and have a job , and support myself .  However , I want to experience my own dreams . I want to be able to say and do what I please with no strings attatched .  Man it feels good to say that .  I only wish I had the courage to actually do what I am thinking .  I want to travel and find love , and discover who I am before I can make any decisions whatsoever about my future .

I ca n't speak to my parents without them shrugging or belittling my desires and aspirations .  Obviously they are not letting me be who I strive to be .  I want to have a guiltless consciousness .  I want to be able to express myself without thinking of what my concervative and rude to say the least parents might think .  I just decided that maybe I would enjoy being an elementary school teacher , and they shrugged and laughed , saying that I was taking the easy way out of college .  However , if they had taken the time to listen to my reasoning , they would have found my reasons to be much more altruistic than that .  Also , the fact that I dropped a biology class that I am not interested in and have not time to study for ( considering my schedule at present ) made them cringe .  I had to listen to how all I am here for is a good time and how I am only taking 13 hours when my dad struggled with 18 hours .  I am not them , and I do n't believe in their repression .",0,27,2,0,0,0,1,0,2,9,63,3,7,0,6,34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,12,121,4

I then quickly changed for school and I almost missed my bus .  I have to ride the city bus to campus from work .  I work downtown , not very far from campus .  My first class today was Chemistry .  It seemed like the class wa never going to end .  I learned quite a bit , but I was tired of taking notes .  Then I went to the Gregory gym to work out .  I did very good today and I did n't get tired very fast .  I could n't do my normal 30 minutes on the machine because others were waiting .  I did start on the exercise equipment , trying to work out my legs and abs .  I think I am going to be sore tomorrow .  I really need to lose weight .  I need to get skinny like all the girls on campus , so I can wear low cut jeans and tank tops .  Anyways , I am getting off the subject .  After the exercise , I went to Jester to get something to eat .  I did n't realize the food was going to be processed .  I do n't know , it just was n't what I expected .  The pork chops were okay , but I was very hungry .  I finished up my economics homework and went to class .  I had to call and remind my husband to pick me up at 8:00 pm tonight .  When I got to my Economics class , my professor did n't show up for class .  What a loser .  She preaches how we need to be in class on time and how every class is important , but this is already the second day she missed .  You would think she would lead by example .  Well , what do you expect from a first year professor .  And the thought that she can conduct experiments in a class that has more than 200 students .  What a joke .  I turned in my Lab Report , it was really difficult , but I think I did a very good job .  I am proud of my Lab Report , I hope I get a good grade .  I met this girl in my class today .  I am not sure what her name is , but she was really nice .  She is from Dallas .  But when I told her I was married and had a daughter , she kind of freaked .  Well , she did n't ignore me or anything , but she stopped talking to me as much and she gave her number to the girl sitting on the other side of her .  Am I not good enough to giver her number to ?

As I watched the news today and say story after story of all the people who were killed and of the people who risked their lives to save others I was deeply touched .  Atfirst I was sad as I thought about all those who were killed and their families that they left behind .  But know , as I have watched as our country has come together , I am extremely proud .  I remember at this time last year , American pride was so awesome all across the country .  People had their flags out and people just helped each other .  People began to think more in terms of our country rather than my country .  Today the same thing is happening and many people are uniting to show their pride in their nation , and to remember those that were lost and those that fought for them and lost their lives in the process .  I can remember exactly where I was when the second plane crashed .  I was in my creative writing class and a girl , Emily Momburger , walked in late talking about how a plane had crashed into one of the twin towers .  My teacher turned on the TV and we all watched in awe as it was burning there and people were dyeing .  And then out of nowhere the second plane crashed right before our very eyes .  We were in shock and I remember I got the chills .  I think that I will forever that moment and that feeling inside of me .

So far I havent really met any new people that I would actually fraternize with on a regular basis .

So far in the during these 2-3 weeks of school i have been trying to keep up with the readings , one way is by perchasing the books , which by the way have been giving me back problems . Which leaves me to consider that perhaps I should buy one of those rolling back packs .  The readings so far have been tough to keep up with , because so far i have found that if it is n't interesting i will intend to forget what i just read , unintentionally of course .  Although some chapters , here and there , in this class and that class , have been rather interesting .  I really hate the food i must eat while i am on campus .  Always relying on fast food is disgusting .  A person could only take hamburgers , french fries , chicken nuggets , tacos , and even sandwiches for so long .

I am always so nervous about screwing up in class like for example Psychology I am always worried that im gunna forget to do something and I am always worried that im not taking the right notes .

I always woder wether they would really take me out of school but im not gunna ever see because i wo n't let my self be that bad of a student .  I worry alot way to much i just wish sometimes i could just say F *** it and do my own thing but i know if i do that then i will fall behind and never be able to catch up .  I think one of the real reasons that im always worried is because im dislexic and i feel that sometimes that holds me back from being a great student .

I 'll just give them a call or something to verify before I trek over there next .  I wonder if Rick checked in at Target for that television shelf mom saw .  I 'd like to go check for it and hang around with him this weekend , but I may be going back to Houston .  It 'll be good to see mom , dad , and Anna again .  It 's great up here , but it 's obviously considerably different than it would be staying in the bed I 've slept in for eighteen years .  It 's funny how that sort of thing works .  Something so simple as a bed or a rug that has always seemed inconsequential can suddenly seem important once it 's gone , though I suppose that 's the way it goes regarding most things .  Taking things for granted is much easier for most people .  I really wish this bloody ear would unclog itself ( bloody being the British exclamation , mind you .  I have a tendency to drop into foreign exclamations some times , and I 'm sure a writing assignment such as this would n't be particularly indicative of the situation surrounding the term .  Yeesh , I rant quite a lot ) .  I 'm sure that last sentence is probably improperly punctuated , but I 'm going to let it slide this time .  Anyway , now I 'm coming to the problem I expected would happen .  I have nothing of real substance to put into the paper , though in essence that in itself is enough to fuel the writing .  This is a stream of consciousness , after all , and noticing that being unable to come up with anything to type is just as fulfilling ( and even as cliche ) as any other topic .  Huh .

I find it incredibly amusing that I am typing this as though I were talking to someone as opposed to writing my traditionally lengthy essays .  English class has taught me well , it would seem .  Okay , I love this Coleman fold out chair and all , but the positioning at my desk is somewhat irritating .  It 's just a bit too low , so I have to set my ketboard in my lap to type , and the annoyance is exacerbated by the fact that my arms are bent when typing .  It 's uncomfortable , but not so much that I can not type .  I am going to arbitrarily place another paragraph now .  This one has run on for far too long with out a break , irregardless of the fact that it is nothing but constantly flowing ideas .

All of a sudden , I 'm in a school more than twice as big as my town and a dorm more than twice as big as my high school .  I am deep down enjoying the experience .  On the surface , I am just caught up in reorganizing everything .  I am also still recovering from last year .  I keep thinking that things will pick up and that I will meet people .

It has a better taste .  I think I miss good New Mexican food ( burritos ) almost as much as I miss my old room .  I miss being able to walk down the street without running into another person if I feel like it .  I miss my friends .  I miss being able to have inside jokes and laugh without even talking .

1726,"I just came back to my dorm from Hobby Lobby .  I went there with my friends Lauren and Rachel to get crafts and other supplies for our Nothing Books .  Nothing Books are like scrapbooks , and we have to make them for our sorority , Alpha Epsilon Phi .  I think it 's a really cute way of making sure we remember our pledge term .  Rush week was maybe the most hectic week of my entire life .  First of all , we got to Austin on move-in day , and we spent all day , I mean all day long moving into University Towers .  It was crazy !  We took a break to eat lunch , but the day was insane .  Everyone moving in with their boxes and crates , and the move-in equipment that was supplied was hardly efficient .  So that night , we started rush , after all that mess .  I was so tired and worn out , I could barely walk to the meeting .  The rest of that night is kind of a blur ; I think I came back to Towers after the meeting and went straight to bed .  The rest of the week we had to dress up .  The events got more and more dressy each day , and I could swear that the weather got hotter and hotter each day .  I think I probably sweat more in those 5 days than I ever have .  ever !  It was honestly just gross .  Really , the whole process of Sorority Rush at this university is ridiculous .  I guess I am being a hypocrite , but when you think about it , some sororities will cut you without even getting to know you at all .  You think they like you , and they 're cheering in your face like they love you , saying all kinds of things , like we hope to see you tomorrow , and the next thing you know , they 've cut you .  I guess I am making it sound like it 's an awful experience , when in reality it really was n't so bad .  There were some very entertaining events during rush .  My favorite was probably Skit Night , where we were allowed to go back to a maximum of five houses , and at each house they performed their own unique skit to try to get us to come back to their house the next night for Pref Night .  Pref Night was probably the most emotional night of the whole week .  All of the seniors in the sororities were crying , either because they were excited to get new members the next day , or because they were sad to be leaving .  It could have been a combination of both .  Immediately after we went to our last three houses that night , we were on complete silence .  We could not speak to anyone , not our friends , our families , not even people that were n't rushing .  It was supposed to be our chance to think about the entire week and to make a decision based on only our personal feelings as to which sorority we wanted to be in .  We went back to our group meeting areas for the last time , and we ranked our choices .  It was not very hard for me , because I pretty much knew which one I wanted to be in .  However , there were tons of girls crying that night , torn over what they should do .  I am just glad I was not in that position .  That next day was Bid Day , where everyone found out what sorority they actually got into .  There was even more crying that day .  All around me , girls were screaming and crying , because some of them had n't gotten into their first choice sorority , and some were just so happy with their bids that they could n't contain themselves I guess .  It was crazy !  I was very happy , and when I got out of the building and saw that all of my friends had also been put into my sorority , I was even more ecstatic .  Our pledge class is made up of 62 diverse girls who each contribute something different to the sorority .  I know I am going to love being in Alpha Epsilon Phi .",0,26,3,0,0,0,0,0,3,4,45,2,8,0,6,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0,0,0,20,102,2
1727,"Well , the biggest thing that I have been thinking about is of course , my boyfriend !  He is in San Antonio , and I miss him so much !  I was fortunate enough to see him the past two weekends .  This last weekend I got to see him play in his first college football game at Trinity !  It was really exciting , but it stunk because unlike in high school , I was n't on the track cheering for him .  I was also super happy because I have been able to see my family .  I am such a nerd , because I miss my mom so much !  She has always been there for me , so it is actually kind of hard to make my own decisions .  But it is also good , cause it is definitely time for me to grow up !  My brother came in town for the first time in several months and I did not get to see him , but it did n't bother me , because I know he did n't miss me .  He was away for the Navy , and I wrote him a letter , and he never wrote me back .  He has put my family through so much crap , that I do n't know when I am going to be strong enough to see him .  Thank god the rest of my family is so caring and sane !  Life goes on , and he will soon realize how important his family really is , especially after all we have done for him .  At first , I was extremely nervous about school and Sorority rush , but now everything is getting better .  I was so glad when I became a Zeta because that is what I wanted from the start .  It was just kind of hard because when we were practicing for Phi Psi field day , they tried to put me up in a stunt , and made me feel soooo fat .  I am already so self conscious about my weight , so it really hurt me .  I really do n't want to have an eating disorder , especially after a movie being made about my aunt and her failure as an Olympic athlete because of balimia .  Well , now after almost eight minutes , my arm hurts so much , and all i am wondering is when this is going to be over with ! ! !  I also hope that my studies turn out ok because I really have to study to get good grades , like REALLY !  I am just not smart like everyone else , or at least that is how I feel .  I mean I like all my professors except for Pre-Cal , which really pisses me off because I took pre-cal and calculus in high school and aced them both .  but this adjunct teacher does not teach at all .  He goes over the basic formulas , which I have known since like eighth grade , and then gives us the most difficult homework , which he has not given any examples for or ways to understand in class .  He also words the problems in the most bizarre ways .  All the students are so confused , and it makes me feel so stupid , because it is just Pre-Cal !  So , today I went to the University of Texas Learning Center , and it really seemed to help .

1744,"I do n't really think there is much of a purpose to this assignment .  Granted , I realize its purpose but do not find it to be entirely essential to this course .  I do realize , however , that this experiment is to be able to tap into the minds of students for a multitude of reasons .  One , assuming the student submitted factual personal information ( i.  e.  name and social security number ) , then certain concerned faculty members can tap into the minds of students they , a ) do n't like , or b ) about which they are concerned .  Of course , this can be helpful to understand a student better , or should that student be suicidal , intervene in a timely manner .  Unfortunately , if these submissions are not read when they are first processed , then the suicide could take place without due intervention .  Of course now , whoever is reading this is probably evaluating my deep psychological reasons for even mentioning suicide .  I am sure that this is being analyzed as my subconcious admitting to facts that my cognizant mind would never release .  This , however , is not true .  While one must accept the fact the subconscious and conscious directly interact , rarely does one prevail over the other .  Granted , we have absolute control of the conscious -- or at least , more control than that of the subconscious .  I am sure , that by now , for a 17 year old college student , I have begun to come across as some sort of pyschological analyst who has put entirely too much thought into this essay and that , for the most part , this is a typical essay and those who submit similar writings are merely trying to impress the reader with their psychological knowledge prior to and INTRODUCTORY course .  This is rediculous .  As an instructor , s/he probably does not care how much one particular student knows or what their analytical take on this assignment is .

Actually , I 'm not a fan of poker , so we 'll say that we 're playing four-man Chickenfoot ( dominoes ) .  Please note that the use of four-man was not a sexual comment , but the use of man was simply to imply that there are four / participants / in the game of Chickenfoot in my mind .  As long as we 're discussing dominoes , how about a little trivial information ?  Afterall , one does not know when s/he will appear on a radio quiz or a game show .  The dots of dominoes and die are known as pips .  You may recognize pips from the rock-n-roll band blah-blah-blah and the Pips .

Actually , I do n't care if I meet nice guys or not , I am just looking forward towards getting to go out .  Lately I feel like all I ever do is study .  College is so much more stressful than high school because you do n't know what to expect .  I am not sure if I am studying enough .  At least I will be able to tell after I receive my grades from all of these tests .  I am so tired .  I wish I could take a nap .  Hopefully after class I will have time to eat , workout , and take a nap .  I am really upset that I have n't had much time to work out lately .  When I was in high school I had cheerleading practice everyday .  I was always working out .  Now the only thing my body is use to is walking around to all my classes .  It makes me feel so out of shape .  Britany Spears is the best .",0,22,4,0,1,0,0,0,1,7,47,6,7,0,6,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,8,101,2
1774,"I am so glad it is Friday .  I am going home because my friend is also going home and his parents are out of town , so he is going to have some parties .  I know it will be fun .  I am also going to get to watch my brothers football game .  He is a senior this year , and from what he has told me he is doing good in football .  I only live an hour away from Austin so I do n't have a long drive .  It could be long though if I-35 is bad .  I just go North on 35 until I get to Temple so I am happy about that because I do n't have far to go .  I also miss my boyfriend who I will get to see tonight also .  We have been going out for 6 months now , which is definately a record for me .  I sometimes ask myself what in the world is wrong with me ?  All my friends and my parents also ask me that same question .  I just tell them I have no idea .  He is a real nice guy though , and will do anything for me .  He pays for everything and takes me anywhere I want to go or do .  I do not like Austin much , but i love UT .  I know that is weird but I 'm not much of a city girl .  I hate all the traffic and the weird people .  That is why I love going home because it is out in the country .  We have trees and ponds surrounding us and not huge buildings .  It is also a lot more peaceful out in the country and you do n't have the sounds of cars or big rigs .  I like the apartment I am living in this year .  I have three other girls as roommates and it is a lot of fun .  They are also from a small town so we get a long really well .  Last year I lived in the dorms and I hated them .  I lived in San Jacinto and they were real nice for a dorm but I did n't like them because I did n't have a kitchen or my own privacy .  It really just did n't feel like home .  My apartment is a lot better mainly because it is bigger .  Well I wonder what I am going to do this weekend .  Probably go to Cole 's and do some homework and read .",0,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,5,53,0,3,0,5,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,10,78,0
1775,"Well I finally found the website for this place , and now Im not really sure what to say .  Im sitting at my desk , and my room seems really warm .  Im also very angry at my roommate Katie right now .  Sometimes she just isnt very considerate of other peoples feelings .  I signed up for an experiment thing in my CSD class , and I have no idea where the room is !  All it said was Totten and the time and I have no idea what that means .  I hope my teacher explains it closer to the time .  Oh I also have to sign up for the experiment for this class too .  I almost forgot !  The ink on my hand is already wearing off , I should go write down the time on paper when Im done with this .  I really like the class though , except my teacher is boring .  But its cool because I want to major in communications .  The lady from there never called me back !  I should call her again soon .  Well maybe I can get the application online or something .  I wonder whats going on with the guys next door .  They 're always coming over here to say hi .  I think Im going to ask Vinay if he wants to do his calculus homework with me !  Hes pretty smart , and maybe he can help me .  Poor Kris .  I ca n't believe hes sick now because of me !  I hope hes feeling better .  This chair is really nice !  Yesterday was pretty scary , I get really nervous about stuff like that .  The bells at the Tower were really pretty though when they were playing God Bless America .  I guess its a pretty historical moment , and Im glad I was here for that .  Even though this wasnt my first choice I guess its ok .  Its kind of big , but maybe I need that .

1776,I just took that Pre-testing thing for psychology and it made me think a lot about how I view myself .  It kind of put me in a bad mood because I realized how much I look down on myself .  It was interesting to learn that much about myself just by taking a test .  I do n't know if that was one point of the test but it made me think a lot .,0,31,3,0,0,0,1,0,1,5,25,2,8,0,4,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,77,0
1777,"I just got home from a friend 's apartment today .  As of right now I have so many thoughts going through my mind .  I have a hard decision coming up to make .  It is if I want to join a soroity or not .  One of my really good friends is going to rush this semester .  I 'm not sure if I want to do if she is going to at the same time .  I 'm not sure it is the right thing to do together .  However , I 'm still tempted to do it .  The question is if it is right for me .  My parents would both flip out if they found out I wanted to do it .  When they hear the word soroity they automatically think drinking and drugs .  However I have met many people in different soroity 's and they are all really good people .  Many of them are smart and do not fit your stereotypical soroity girl .  All of the ones I have talked to swear by their life that it has made them a better person .  One of my really good friends is in one and she has improved in character in only good ways .  I remember her back in high school , and compared to now she is much more confident .  There are many other things that she says has helped her character but that is the one that stands out the most .  I really do n't know what to do .  It 's all up in the air for now .  I should talk to someone else outside of the college atmosphere and see what they think .  I 'm trying to collect opinions , but they have all been negative so far .  Those negative opinions prolong my decision making .  I figure if I do it then I have to do it now or I never will .  The bad part is that I want no regrets later .  I do n't want to look back and say I wish I had done that .  I 've made that mistake before and , do n't want to do it time and again .  I think a soroity is a great way to get involved with community activities as well .  I know there are volunteer groups out there .  I love doing community service and the events they do really benefit other people .  Another one of my concerns is the time consumption .  I know if I do this all of my waking moments will be dedicated to this one thing .  I 'm not sure if I can handle that or not .  Plus I do n't take rejection very well either .  So I 'd rather not risk it , but then again there is that no regrets thing playing in the process .  Guess decisions will be made at a later time when I have more information about everything .  Right now I like the college life that I 'm living .  I 've met great people .  My only complaint is about my room .  It 's so cold in here that I 'm going to catch hypothermia and die before the semester is over .  I ca n't feel my hands and I have to wear sweatershirts and slippers all the time .  I doubt anyone can do to much about it .  It 's only been ten minutes since I started this assignment .  I feel like it 's been the full twenty .  Another thing I do n't like about my floor here in Jester is the fighting over the washing machines .  For awhile we only had one working washing machine for the entire floor .  I 'd have to do my laundry at like 4 in the morning just to get some of it done .  Now we have three but they always seem to be busy , and no one comes to take out their clothes when they are finished washing .  As if no one else needed the machines .",0,16,4,0,2,0,0,0,0,9,58,2,6,0,2,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,2,6,0,0,8,102,10
1779,"right now im sitting here listening to dave matthews and my roommate is eating fritos with bean dip so i can smell the bean dip and its pretty nasty - ruffles with french onion dip is so much better but whatever - if thats what she wants to eat then thats fine with me .  i think im going to go to the gym and work out tomorrow - the navy stuff hasnt been very much running or working out or anyhting so its kind of pointless to call that my workout for the week .  i think maybe its because were just coming back from the summer and maybe people are out of shape and stuff or something because the navy should be a , little more hard core than its been .  i think the new dave cd is kind of weird but its pretty good - the type of stuff you can listen to over and over without getting sick of it or something .  this keyboard is so weird to type on - im used to my desktop keyboard and this one feels so weird because i like have to reac across it or something - i do n't know what is so weird about it .  i really wanted chick fil a for dinner today but it closes so early at the union - its pretty annoying - so i had to get wendy 's which is good but its not what i wanted .  when i was little i lived in north carolina and i used to get a number 6 with sweet tea - the sweet tea in the south is so good - and then i moved to new jersey and you can only get unsweetened tea and you have to put sugar in it and its pretty gross because then the sugar doesnt even really dissolve into the tea so you get nasty granules of it in your straw .  i do n't even know if you can order sweet tea down here - i havent tried but i doubt it .  you have to dissolve the sugar into it before its cold because its so much better that way .  now i want some sweet tea but theres no way im going to be able to find any right now so maybe ill have to figure out a way to get it for tomorrow or something .  i think my cd is over now .  no its not .  i do n't know why i always think its done right here but i always think that and its pretty annoying .  oh well i guess its a nice surprise to still have a lot more left on the cd .  my stereo stops after one cd instead of just going on to the next one .  maybe i should figure out how to program it so it just goes to the next one .  i feel like im typing really loudly and im distracting emily or something .  oh well she can live .  im really tired and its only like 9:45 .  probably because i woke up at like 5:30 this morning .  this song is definitely the best on this cd .  i love dave matthews - I 've been to so many concerts and they were all awesome .  ill have to find one down here to go to or maybe ill just wait until im back home and go to one then .  that way i would be able to hang out with my friends back there .  not that i wouldnt be able to hang out with them anyway .  it doesnt smell like bean dip anymore - now it smells like air freshener .",0,21,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,10,31,2,16,0,12,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,8,94,4

Before I came to college , I knew what I wanted to be and do so I was going to come here and work for that goal .  I would rather do nothing else but be a teacher .  I want to teach so much but there is absolutely no money in it .  And thats terrible because teachers can be so influencial .

17,"Psychologists .  Always trying to understand how the mind works , and how it does n't work in some cases .  Can such things be understood , or are we merely deluding ourselves that knowledge of any kind can be attained ?  I guess I 've always found psychology to be a very pretentious field .  though an interesting one .  We all want to control our lives , and anticipating the actions and desires of others helps us maintain that facade of control .  Perhaps I 'm getting into a more philosophical realm at the moment , but that is where my thoughts take me .  Is free will merely an illusion ?  I 've thought about this a lot .  Unfortunately there are no definitive answers to this or other questions .  Is there a god ?  I 've never heard a logically sound argument for the existence of a god .  I allow for the possibility of a deity , but it certainly would n't be the Christian God .  I think ultimately that I have to agree with the existentialists .  There is no proof for or against the existence of a god , so we should stop wasting time speculating and just deal with this life .  Few people can deal with that .  Our fear of death makes us create religions , so that we can pretend there is some semblance of life after our earthly bodies die .  These are not new thoughts , I 'm just thinking on demand ; my mind moves most easily to the pathways it knows , and I present some of the more coherent ideas here .  Is someone actually reading this ?  Do you understand that I am human ?  I am not an object .  I am in a body , but I am not the body alone .  I am a mind , vast and complex .  I am .  Do you feel superior because you can analyze minds ?  I ask you this , so that you can ask yourself .  Do you enjoy treating people as objects ?  Do you even admit in your conscious mind that you treat people as objects ?  Perhaps not .  It 's possible that I 'm being slightly unfair to you and your profession .

They ( Jeremiah and Lauren ) came to visit this weekend and even though they have only been gone for an hour and fifteen minutes I miss them like crazy !  Jeremiah means everything to me and I ca n't stand the thought of him being five hundred miles away .  But then again I decided to come to Texas and not to Tech .  Right ?  Well , that is one thing that is bothering me , the other thing eating away at me is that my new step-mother , who is only four years older than me , is causing some major problems back at home .  And on that note it really ticks me off that as soon as I left home she has been on a rampage and really screwing up everything .  I feel really helpless because I am over here in Austin and I ca n't help my sister or my dad go through their problems . I usually stuck up for them when I was home and now I just get to hear about them over the telephone .  Which is even more bad because they may or may not be telling me the whole story .  I know my dad can handle it but its my kid sister I 'm worried about .  Jessica , my step mom is such a pain .  She is very very , immature for her age and I saw this coming the whole time .

I would have to kill myself if I lived in Michigan or something like that .  Just imagine , waking up at 6am to go to work , and having your car door frozen shut .  That is my hell .

1854,"The one thing that amazes me the most is the complexity of the female mind .  At one point , you think you know exactly what they want , but as soon as you can comfortably assume that , it all gets twisted around and kicks you in the ass .  Also , when you are on the flip side of goodbye , you really start to understand the importance of relationships .  If you are always on the winning team , you do n't know what it would be like to lose .  The more you win , the more you will think yourself invincible until you are brought down , and then you feel the most devastating emotion you have ever felt .  The only difference is that with relationships , you never think about losing , especially if youre on a winning streak .  True , some people will never have to experience being on the heartbreaking side of goodbye , but if you keep playing the game , eventually you will lose .  No matter how much success you have after your loss , even if it is a bigger victory , you will always remember the loss you experienced and try to figure it out .  I 've found myself racking my brain to try and figure out something that I will ever be able to understand .  The saying that time will heal all wounds is a load of crap .  Time only allows wounds to fester and become infected .  I think that relationships are more like getting drunk more than anything else .  The more you drink it in , the better it feels .  You know that the feeling wo n't last forever , but you keep doing it anyway , always hoping .

I so badly want to step forward and correct everything that these people are doing wrong but for some reason I keep holding myself back .  This frustration only makes my head hurt and keeps me angry at the world .  My presence then becomes quite rude and unfriendly .  I 'm not quite sure what to do about this little problem .  I really do n't think that it 's me .  My suitemate is about to push me over the edge .  She never picks up after herself , never helps clean the dorm room , never buys and groceries ( even though she finds its all right to consume mass quantities of the food that me and my two other roomates buy ) , and she basically is worthless around the room .  For example , the other day she mentioned that we needed paper towels and bottled water .  On most circumstances that wouldnt bother me , however , she makes these claims but at the same time takes no initiative to fix them .  She just assumes that me or my roomates will take care of the missing items in the room .  She is from Beverly Hills .  Im under that impression that she had someone to pick up after her and do everything for her when she lived there .  Typical if you ask me .  I just ca n't handle her behavior or her attitude anymore .  On top of that , I am homesick .  I miss my friends .  I miss being with Richie .  He 'll call me once and a while .  Usually he 'll call me non stop for a straight week , and then I wo n't hear from him for quite a while .

Sure , he may not show the normal feelings that most people show towards the ones that they care about , but I know that he cares about me .  If he didnt care , he wouldnt bother calling me .  Its honestly one of the worst feelings knowing that your best friend in the world is sitting there making fun of you and getting annoyed by the fact that you are in a complete state of happiness when you talk to the one person you care about .  It really makes me wonder why she is the one person I confide in the most .  Speaking of her , she is in this relationship with a boy whom I adore as a friend .  He is so much fun to be around , but he is here all the time .  I turn around and he is always there .

I do n't know how much weight that pulls in his decision , but I hope that is n't the basis for his decision .  he started out at Baylor because they are said to have a good pre-med program , which is ultimately his goal .  he met with the hpo office while he was here , and met with an advisor about the science program here .  he was impressed that it was so similar to Baylor 's .  We then went over to the admissions office so that he could meet with someone about credits needed to transfer and other such items .

I have gotten a chance to meet a lot of people .  My roommates are all really nice and i enjoy hanging out with them .  I also got the chance to join a sorority here .

1871,"Right now I feel kind of tired from schoolwork and extracurricular activities .  Last night I felt cranky and could not concentrate much .  I think it had something to do with having two tests on a given Thursday .  My nose is sort of stuffy and my eyes seem to be watery .  I noticed today that the sky was a little cloudy as I walked to all of my classes .  I thought that meant that there was high humidity or something .  Possibly too much water in the air meant that there was more sweating and less evaporation of the sweat .  I just came back from the student service building to get two vaccinations .  One for meningitis and the other for Hepetitus B.  I felt worried about diseases when I arrived on campus .  In addition to the worries , I obtained a pamplet from the student services building recommending that I get the shots .  My left arm feels a little different than usual .  The nurse warned me of possible side effects but I was not too worried about that because I do not have any known allergic reactions .  I think I try to type faster than I am able to and because of it I seem to make many mistakes in my typing requiring me to use the backspace key often .  I think that when I was learning how to type I emphasized speed more importantly than preciseness or acuratcy .  My neck and shoulders feel a little tight and cramp .  My lower back pain has been giving me some trouble .  I remember seeing the chiropractor about a month ago and he told me a little exercise would do just fine .  I felt relieved knowing that my x-ray results were good .  I came out to be that I had an extra lower back vertabrae .  Not too rare but not particurally normal .  My eyes are now feeling dry and probably red by now .  Ever since I started wearing contacts , for about 3 years now , I 've been worried about the dryness , redness , and clarity of my eyes .  I might need to use some eye drops now .  I think it might have something to do with my shots but the nurse did warn me about possible side effects .  I usually do n't think stuff like that will effect me directly .  Although some things that i do n't think effect me usually do .  For instance when I got into my car crash about three months ago I didn ; t think that it would happen to me .  My parents would tell be to be careful in the rain but I would usually ignore that fact that I 'll end up in an accident .  I would n't rool me eyesor anything disrepectful , but I would just let the message slide .",0,20,5,0,2,0,0,0,1,6,42,1,2,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,14,85,2

Walking all over the campus is extremely exhausting and tiring .  However , this weekend I did not walk a whole lot .  I have just been sleeping so much .  I think that it could be that I miss my mother or family and my body could be going through some sort of physical depression .  That , I have no idea about .  I do feel that I am getting sick .  I have had a minor soar throat the past two days , and I am upset with myself because I forgot to bring my Vitamin C chewable tablets .  I really like the cherry flavored ones because they taste so much better than the orange flavored ones .  I know that you can only purchase the ones that I like at SunHarvest .  I am not even sure if there is a SunHarvest here in Austin .  I do have a large gallon of orange juice , so I will just drink a whole bunch of that until I start feeling better .  Or at least until I get paid so I can buy my vitamin C pills .

1878,"I am feeling very tired at the beginning of this strange assignment .  What a long weekend , and day it has been .  Rainy days always seem so long and dreary .  It has just recently stopped raining but I wish that it had n't .  In my opinion , days spent studying are much better when it is dark and gloomy out than sunny and shiny .  I actually love the rain and really enjoy rainy days .  I would really prefer for the rainy days to also be cold but that does not happen very much this time of year .  One thing that I have been thinking a lot about recently is this new season that is rapidly approaching .  I love the fall more tham anytime of year , especially the month of October .  What a fabulous month it is .  October is long sleeve and jacket weather , football games , State Fair of Texas , and the time when the leaves change .  It is always so pleasant and so comforting .  I do not know why or when my obsession with October started but it did , and it has been a part of my life for quite some time .  This will be my first October away from home though so my expectations could very likely NOT be met .  That would be a dissapointment but it would also serve as a reminder to me to not expect anything .  I really wish that I would never expect anything from anybody because I am always setting myself up for a dissapointment when I do that .  People that do not have really high expectations from others or situations must really benefit from life because everything that happens to them is better than they though it would be .  That is actually probably not always true but , its a thought .  I tend to have too high expectations from people .  I have a big imagination so I will usually get worked up about something before it ever happens , and spend time imaging what it might be like .  When I do that , I always find myself dissapointed when things do not turn out the way that they are supposed to .  I am about to be distracted from my stream of conciouseness because my roomate and friends keep talking loudly in the hall and I can hear them .  It is late at night so I did not take my medicine to help me focus so I hope this does not become too much of a problem .  It is very hard for me to concentrate when I can hear one distinct conversation in the background .  It is a strange thing , but I could write a paper in the middle of a crowd if it is just useless , background noise , nothing clear , just a lot of muddled voices .  If I hear a conversation though , a really clear conversation among a group of people , it becomes near impossible for me to focus .

187,"Hmmm .  stream of consciousness .  Follow my train of thought .  I guess I can say I 've had experience with this in that I used to , and still do sometimes , write down stuff when I just had to get something off my chest .  I followed my thoughts and emotions .  It helped me a lot to get through some things .  I had never really done anything like that until this past summer .  I guess it was because I had n't had anything bother me so much until then .  But anyhow , I am not about to tell you about my experience ; that is personal .  I find it strange that I never really liked to write , assignments for example .  I found it so boring and pointless .  But now I realize that many authors write for pleasure , for entertainment , or to simply get something off their chest .  But I guess you learn as you go .

I 've been told that I have a contorted way of looking at myself and that when I look in the mirror I see something different from what everyone else sees .  But is n't that true for a lot of people ?  Do n't a lot of people see themselves in the mirror and not like what they see ?  I think that it is perfectly normal to feel this way .  What is n't normal though is acting upon it .  Oh well .  I can still hear the television and sometimes it distracts my thoughts because I begin to pay more attention to what is on the tv rather than my own thoughts .  Now I want goldfish because I just heard the commercial .  I ca n't think of what to type again .  I think that this assignment causes us to think too much about what to type and that it puts us on the spot so that we freeze up and are no longer able to type what we think because we keep trying to type interesting things and not simply what is really on our minds .  My room mate just laughed .  I wonder why she laughed .  I can hear the people out in the hallway .  These walls are really thin because I can always hear what is going on outside .

I have the song Nashville Blues by Cory Morrow in my head because last night , after walking Rachel back to her room , I came in to find three half-naked , drunken frat boys had wandered into my room and awoken my roommate .

1900,"Wow I 'm probably not doing this under the smartest of conditions seeing that I 'm listening to some Allman Bros.  very loud as well as the St.  Louis / Denver game in the background but what the hell why not .  I was thinking about what the hell I was going to write about earlier and I guess it should be what it is -- a stream of consciousness .  Ha .  Well anyway I probably should not stop writing .  It 's funny how sometimes your mind works faster than the rest of your body ( especially your hands ) because sometimes I will think of something and begin typing it and then I will forget what in the hell I was thinking about until it 's too late .  The same thing even happens in conversations , and that sucks a big fat hairy one when I 'm in the middle of talking with some one about school or music or the thing I was watching last night and then I will completely go blank because it takes me so long to get the words out of my mouth .

Hmm that was the third time I have corrected my spelling .  I wonder how many other people are as anal retentive as myself and are constantly correcting their spelling in this assignment .  Typing is such a weird thing .  I do it so much that I feel fairly proficient , but I was talking to pops last night and he said that he only types with two fingers .  How does one get through life in any situation where he/she only types with two fingers .  I just thought about what an ass I was last night .

1913,"Well here I am in the Undergraduate Library writing my Stream of Consciousness paper .  I still have n't really figured out yet what I will write about , but I suppose that this type of paper is n't really supposed to have a meaning .  That 's good I guess , right .  Sure .  It 's cold in the computer lab here .  It 's always cold in this lab .  And it 's always cold in the library .  In most places throughout the University , in fact , it is cold .  It is especially cold in the student union .  I mean -- ridiculously cold .  it must be about 70 degrees in there .  There is one place , however , that I have found is not cold - it is hot .  My calculus class in the experimental sciences building it really warm .  And it does n't really help that it is still like 90 degrees outside .  One thing I have noticed though , is that it is getting a little cooler outside .  This is very good news .  Hopefully it will continue to get cooler .  So looking at the timer at the top of this page , I am beginning to realize that a twenty minute writing is quite a long time , especially when you consider the fact that I really have no topic , nor have I even begun to write on a topic .  It 's just meaningless facts from my mind .  I 'm sure that this has some kind of meaning - this writing I mean .  There must be some point for this .  Hopefully at least .  So far my classes have been pretty good .  I do n't have a huge workload yet .  I assume that it will pick up eventually .  Especially next semester .  From Laurel 's experience , I have a feeling that next semester will be quite a bit tougher than this one .  Actually , I am quite certain that it will be rough .  I will be taking differential equations -- which Scheffer said was hard -- and physics , which I know will be hard .  Oh well , I can handle it .  I am enjoying school , though .  It is quite a bit different than anything else I have experienced this far in my life .  All the freedom and extra time .  I just like the atmosphere that is college .  It 's fun and different .  Well only five minutes have gone by so far .  I 'm still a little hungry .  I should have had more lunch .  Oh well .  I only have one more class , and it starts in 45 minutes and is only an hour .  That 's not too bad .  I am writing on a Macintosh computer right now .  I did n't particularly want to use one , but it was available , so I took it .  They are n't too bad I suppose .

I always wondered what 's done with these assignments .  whether they test us students for mental illness or just conduct some research on us as though we 're guinea pigs .

I ca n't really concentrate for , wow , eighteen more minutes , since I 've had quite a lack of sleep over the past few days .  It 's getting harder and harder to stay awake as the days go by .  The thing that bothers me is that all my classes have more than three hundred students except for one of them , so there really is no one to keep me awake except maybe the occasional glance from the professor .  I 've been mostly lucky about getting good ones .  I 'm getting a bit hungry now but the time is keeping me in , and my stomach is starting to growl .  Hmm , spaghettios or mac and cheese , or should I finally start off with something healthy , I mean there is a whole fridge full of food .  maybe an apple , then some pasta .  That would sound good .  I need to do something to keep my freshman 15 off , maybe the occasional biking and the insane walking I do every day might work off those hamburgers .  This computer screen is making my eyes blurry , and I 'm now slowly falling asleep .  Aww man , I actually have to stay awake today in order to pass my quiz tomorrow in theater .  It should n't be too bad .  I do n't even know if I 'm supposed to be doing punctuation or capitalizing the words .  It 's not like this is an official paper , but since I 'm a perfectionist I ca n't really deal with things that are out of line or place .  I guess it only works on AOL because it 's just faster to type this way .  I just realized that I get off track too easily , I may have some form of ADD .  I can barely even listen to myself talk for 20 minutes .  It 's really hard when I 'm face to face with someone .  I just ca n't stand in one place for that long .

I was all alone and then my family shows up and they seem interested for a while and then they forget about the situation and wonder around without taking me in to and emergency room .  I thought it was weird but then again I later on had another dream I do n't remember what it was right now but I know that I had to do with lack of attention .  I figure these dreams are happening because I 'm far away from home and I do n't receive the same attention , its just a matter of adapting to different environments .  its weird how I 'm here in the lab and everyone is in there own little world for instance the girl next to me seem s to be having problems with the computer yet she never asks for help , why ?  and then there 's a girl in front all into her study or research I do n't know what she is doing and she looks so interested .  I really do n't know what else to write I mean those things came to the top of my mind once I started writing but now I do n't know .  I really hope arturo writes to me this coming week I mean he is in the army and I 'm really scared for him specially since his last letter where he told me they were going to send him to iraq .  that sucks because I got attached to him .  specially at prom the night was so perfect everything was going great until it was time to leave to our houses .  I mean why ca n't I find a guy who 's like him I mean he is great he is sensitive , sweet , crazy , funny I do n't know I could go on but why ca n't I find someone ?  he would be perfect but he is too slim we look like a 10 when were next to each other not that I 'm fat but I 'm fatter than he is .  if he could only gain lets say maybe 25 pounds he would be dream guy material .  ericka is changing a lot I do n't know what her problem is I think it all turns out to be that she has no goal in life .  she knows she wants to be a doctor because that 's what everyone tells her but she does n't really now what it is she want to do with the rest of her life .  she is a lost child , all she cares for is FUN I mean its important to have fun but everyday ?  that 's just not right .",0,29,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,14,26,2,10,0,8,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,10,91,0

I do n't know how people do it every night !  I am so worn out every day !  I just need to take a few days off to sleep .  I am so mad that our zeta retreat is the weekend of austin city limits !

Great now everytime I exercise I am going to think about what I am thinking about and that is going to take away from the effort I put into my workouts .  Damm .  I should have stayed at the gym longer today .  30 minutes of cardio is not enough .  I was not as tired as a seemed .  I could be there right now , still burning calories away on the weights or cardio .

It 's not that I want to be partying everyday , still I would like to see what 's all the fuss 's about .  Then again , my life here at the apartment is great .  I live with two roommates , each have their own eccentricity , still without them I would be bored out of my mind .  These restaurants around here keep on posting flyers in front of my door - it 's getting really annoying .  I 'm hungry , yet I do n't want to go grab something to eat - does that make me lazy ?  Of course not !  It 's because I have to sit here for 20 minutes to write this assignment , yea that 's it .

There is no final and we end the class in November .  To me that just seems a little disturbing .

January was the start of an awesome semester of high school .  I think I was actually popular in high school , which is weird to think about .  I was never like the prom queen or anything , but I had about a ton of friends , and I knew they were all loyal .  they were so great , they still are great .

It could be worse .  I need to try to call my aunt today .  I tried yesterday , but she was not there and I really did n't want to leave a message .

1949,"I guess I should begin by saying I 'm pretty tired today .  I woke up feeling sort of sick .  My throat hurt a little bit , and my body ached as well .  The dorm rooms are really cold .  I went to the financial aid office for some information but I do n't even remember how to access what the lady told me to .  I 've been thinking a lot lately and worrying about school .  I 'm worried about this college algebra class I 'm supposed to be getting into through ACC .  They said they have n't received my transcript although I know it was sent from Houston on August 15 , I even have the receipt .  It pisses me off that ACC 's records department is screwed up .  This class is really important to me so that I can take my core classes next semester or so .  Besides that stress , I 've been stressed about Gabby .  It does n't really feel like we 've been broken up .  I know it 's only been a week , but it does n't feel like it to me .  I think he is really more upset about it than me .  My cell phone bill should be coming in the mail soon and I know my dad is going to kill me because it 's going to be super expensive .  The guy sitting next to me in this computer lab is typing super fast !  He reminds me of the part on Meet the Parents "" where he is at the airport looking for a different flight and the clerk types really fast and finds nothing .  Makes me smile .  Tomorrow I think I 'll go to ACC 's records department .  I mean , I have a receipt that says I sent the transcript , so I wonder what kind of run around they will give me this time .  Last time they were extremely rude to me .  I mean , I 'm new to all this , especially to ACC .  It 's not like I knew they would lose my transcript .  The computer lab down here in the basement of Jester is pretty hot .  I do n't feel an air-flow .  Just still air , and the typing of the guy sitting next to me .  He just left right now .  I heard him talk on his cell phone a few minutes ago about getting something to eat , which sounds good to me right now .  I had some oreo 's while in class today , and my friend Gabriella was talking about how fat she is gotten , the girl is super skinny , not to mention in great shape because she runs 5 miles a day !  But she was saying that oh my gosh oreo 's are so fattening , yet she would kill for one .  I offered her one , but she declined .  I thought to myself oh my god !  What is this girl thinking .  All she talks about is what she eats and does n't eat .  It was kinda getting on my nerves , but oh well .  I enjoyed the oreos and that 's all that matters .  I did n't feel guilty about eating them since I am probably going to go to the gym later on tonight .  I wish I would have had some milk with those oreos though !  New guy sitting next to me in computer lab .  I hope he does n't glance over and wonder what I 'm doing .  I guess I am pretty focused on my computer screen .  I feel relaxed though .

I just realized if I close my eyes and type it is a lot easier to think .  so if there are any typos that is the reason .  because from now on I refuse to open my eyes .  let my type the lyrics of the last song I wrote .  it was about my ex girlfriend to broke up with me for no reason at all .  for the third time .  I loved her and it tore me up so bad everytime she did that .  and I took her back twice after she did it but the third time I had to let her go .  she had issues .  and she hates this song because she heard it for the first time at the talent show last year .  it did n't go over too well with her .  here is goes .  this song is called late night song "" I wrote it really late the night she broke up with me .  hence the name : I spend my time alone , I wish you know the sadness that has grown , I fell in love , and it only fell apart , I never knew , I could have a broken heart .  and I hope the way we lived , follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shared and I wish the time was still , cause we do n't have long before we 're gone and this late night song is all you 'll ever have .  its been a week today , the time has gone and I still feel the same .  so hear this song , and try to make it last , its all you 'll hear , cause I regret my past .  and I hope the way we lived , follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shard and I wish , the time were still , we do n't have long before we 're going to and this late night song , is all you 'll ever have , and I hate the way we lived , and I want to know where I stand , and I hate the way we lived , and I want to know who I am .  and I hope the way we lived , follows you forever and reminds you of the times we shared and I wish , the time were still , we do n't have long before we 're gone and this late night song is all you 'll lever have .",0,31,6,0,0,0,0,0,5,12,59,1,12,0,6,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,20,129,4

I guess the whole thing is stupid and I should n't worry bout it cause I am easy going and I should let things go with the flow I 'm going to call dusting when I 'm done so I can see if he is going to the hell raisers .  wow it is quiet in here with no music I want to turn on ole Kenny but ill wait 10 min left this is going by fast .  I thought I was barely talking .  I wish I knew her name I talk to her everyday and she is in 3 of my classes and she introduces me to people and I do n't even know her name that 's kinda fucked up but I could like seinfeld introduce someone and she has to say her name .  that would work I wonder when seinfeld comes on its not like it matters though all I really do anymore is read and study .,0,37,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,30,3,4,0,1,24,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,12,88,0

I hope no one reads this too carefully .  so its always been really cold in my room but now its kind of hot .  I think this could be a good way to vent some of my feelings .  I keep thinking about kurt and I wonder if I should call him back or not .  everyone keeps saying to never call him back because he only called me because rachel is in dallas but I do n't even think for sure that he called because he wants to get back together maybe he just wanted to explain since he never did .

I did n't think they would bother me that much but its starting to get on my nerves esp .  ok so this other thing just popped up and it said to hold down enter for ten seconds to see some cool thing and I did n't want to because with all my pop ups I figured it would just lead to porn or something of the likes so I tried to push the little x in the corner and it would n't close and then it went to some screen with stars or something and said enjoy your break now get back to work .  at first I thought it was for this maybe it was but then I got back to this screen and my time was starting all over .  that sucks .  I hope this is over soon .  anyways I 'm still thinking about kurt .  no one can assume that he called me back because he wants to get back together .  he could just want to talk .  he did say the first time that he just called to see how I have been .  and I 'm still mad at him for what he did but I do want to forgive him because I just do n't want something like that hanging over me forever and I hate to hold grudges .  and I do want us to be friends and I know it would be hard for me to say I did n't want him back but even if that is what he wanted I would n't do it no matter how hard because of what he did to me .",0,36,7,0,3,0,0,0,3,11,40,9,15,0,13,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,8,135,4

That is why I ca n't watch TV Every thing I see reminds me of something else and I start to not watch the TV .  I like it here ( UT ) .

I remember in junior high when we all used to chew up paper and make spit-wads to throw at the ceiling and see who could get the most stuck .  Is that how you would spell spit-wads ?  There 's so many words that I 'm not quite sure how to spell .  I remember I used to hate spelling tests in elementary .  Wow , I could n't believe that I sat next to someone today in my Calculus class who was actually in my kindergarten class !  I had n't seen him in forever .  I must say it really freaked me out .  It was hot today .  The walk to the business school killed me .  On the one hand I love that I live in Kinsolving .  Great food .  Nice people .  Close to the drag .  Plus a whole lot of my classes are near Kinsolving .  When did Lisa leave ?  It must have been around 12 .  I wonder when she is getting back .  I 'm excited to go home tomorrow .  even if it is just for a few hours .  I left so much stuff there !

Man , that timer thing at the top of this page is making me nervous for some reason .  I definitely hate timed tests .  Such as the SAT 's .  For starters I hate the fact that it 's a standardized test .  Secondly , I hate that it 's timed .  And above all else I HATE the fact that colleges weigh your application so heavily on your scores .  Now I know that it makes sense to do it that way because they need some way to evaluate your intelligence in comparison to all other applicants .  However , some people are just not good test takers .  ME !  In school I can study , understand , and learn material that enables me to do well on my tests and quizzes .  But going into a test not knowing exactly what it will ask makes me so intimidated and nervous .  See , look at me .  When I start talking about tests and intelligence scores I try to make coherent sentences ; in other words I try to make myself seem intelligent .  Enough of that .  What else am I thinking about .  I ca n't believe that I am actually in college .  It sounds so cliche , but I can remember just yesterday when I was in elementary school .  how my biggest concern was who I was going to play with after school .  or what time recess was .  It was great being a kid .  That 's not to say that I do n't enjoy the freedom that I have now , but with freedom comes tremendous responsibility .

2017,"Okay , let 's see .  I 'm really really stressed out right now over Calculus .  I feel like I am doing so horrible in it .  I made what I consider to be a pretty crappy grade on the homework that was due last night , and all it was was a review .  I got a 75 .  7 .  The homework before that I got something like an 85 .  3 .  My goal as of last night is to make a B in the class for the semester .  I 'm really worried about it though because I really have been studying hard and it seems as though the hard work is n't really paying off .  I just need to find some people who know what they 're doing to study with and do the homework with .  That 'd be nice , but I do n't know anybody .  The only other class I 'm seriously worried about , ironically , is this one , Psychology .  I do n't know what to expect yet all I keep hearing is about how hard it is .  I love psychology and am really interested in the material , but I 'm still extremely apprehensive .  I guess I 'm just worried I 'm going to do really bad or something .  I want to have about a 3 .  5 GPA or higher .  I do n't rightly know how that whole scale works , so I 'm not sure how hard that is to do exactly .  I 'm just so stressed out it seems . This weekend was my birthday and all my friends wanted me to go out and do things , and that 's all good , but I actually wanted to stay home and study .  I really have been worried .  I have n't been really social either .  I 'm normally a fairly sociable person , or at least I think I am , but lately , I 've just been studying .  On top of that , I never really make much effort to meet the other girls on my wing , or go out with new people , or even meet that many people in my classes or anything .  I have to admit that I have made a few friends , but I guess I had some preconception of my coming here and just being bombarded with cool people and making really awesome connections .  I have n't really done that yet .  I still get depressed and my eating habits , though better when I first arrived , are starting to diminish fast .  What really sucks is that I 've found out a way to binge and purge here as well .  I was hoping that living in a place with a communal bathroom I would have to stop all that , and that it would be a great leap for me in my recovery , but I 've found a way .  It 's horrible .  I see myself slipping more and more each day , and the old thoughts of how easy it would be are starting to come back .  I really do hate myself so much sometimes .  I feel so worthless .  It 's like in Calculus , I 've been working my ass off and I 'm still doing shitty .  I do n't have any friends , I do n't have any self-esteem , and I have horrible social anxiety .  It 's so bad sometimes .  It 's been worse lately .  Like today , I feel fat and ugly , so therefore I do not look up when I walk , I do n't make any attempt to talk to anyone and when they talk to me I have to pretend to give a shit and be perky , whereas I feel so pressured to say something of meaning or something funny or something that 's even remotely interesting that I end up saying less .  I just hate it .  I have nothing to be afraid of , that 's what they tell me , but that 's just the way it 's always been .  I hate being alone , and though I 'm not really depressed , or at least not as much as I have been in the past , I 'm just so damn lonely .  I just want someone who I can talk to and laugh with and do things with .  It always seems as though I have nothing .",0,35,6,0,0,0,0,0,1,14,58,3,14,0,3,42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,4,0,0,12,133,2

I really really want an A , but I read the professors pick-a-prof reviews and now realize how hard it will be .  There is so much reading , I do not know how I can keep up with it .  There is a good song playing on my computer right now , Calling You "" by Blue October .  The class DJ should play it in our class , even though it really does not have anything to do with psychology , but it does not seem like much of his music does .  Yesterday in class , when he walked up there to put on his music , I made a comment like ' oh no , here we go again ' , and it turns out his friends were sitting right behind me and might have heard me .  I felt kind of bad .  I do n't know what psychological value can be obtained from this .  I find it hard to believe people will be reading all of this .  Now an Incubus song is playing , its a slower , relaxing type song called "" Echo "" .  Everytime I hear it it reminds me of the friend who introduced it to me .  And for some reason it reminds me of us playing beach volleyball .  I have no idea why , the song has nothing to do with volleyball .  That seems to happen a lot , when I read/hear something and it reminds me of something else vividly , for no apparent reason .  There was this book I read by dean koontz , I ca n't remember the title ( I read a lot ) , and everytime I read it , for some reason I would play the Staind CD in my head .

Jared , has been the ony guy that I have ever loved and I thought I would marry him .  we spend holidays together and I am already a part of his family and he is part of mine .  To think of him being with someone else just kills me and I am so torn up right now that I can not concentrate on anything but him .  I had to end it because I can not continue to be hurt when all I have done is devote my whole life to him .  he assured me all summer that things would be fine with us apart and that if he was to join a fraternity that it would never get in the middle of what we had together .  My thoughts are horrible right now and I NEVER thought that I could feel so hurt and ashamed .  My biggest fear is that he wo n't even care because he will just move on since he is so involved and has so many opportunities to meet other girls .",0,39,10,0,0,0,1,0,2,9,52,3,8,0,17,68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,0,0,0,0,4,143,0

Last night I was reading for economics , but I was too sleepy and nothing I was reading was sinking in .  I set my alarm clock for 7:40 , but it did n't go off so I missed calculus .  That is got me worried .  But I 'm pretty sure that I 'll do okay .  Now I have 7 minutes and 50 seconds writing , still not too sure what I 'm doing , still having my doubts .  I think of so many things when I 'm by myself , I go into my own little world and just think about anything and everything .  But when I 'm asked what I 'm thinking , I go completely blank .  And people think that I 'm just holding things from them , that I 'm keeping to myself .  Maybe that 's partly true , but I really do go blank a lot of times .  My memory is really weird .  I can remember the smallest most insignificant details about something , and then not remember something important that occurred .

It is ironic how the mind works , that is why I have always wanted to take a psychology class , so I could better understand its inner workings .  I am frustrated that I really can not think of a single thing however .  I miss my best friend , Faith .  She is at Oachita ( spelling ? )  in Arkadelphia .  It is about 8 hours from here .

I miss my high school life but I still prefer my college life .  In high school everything seems controlled because my parents placed restrictions on my life but now here , its different because there is no one to control me .  I sort of like this new freedom because my parents were really strict at home .  I never got to stay out late but now , I could do whatever I want .  I 'm just afraid that I might mess up my schoolwork here at college .  I do n't want to mess up because I want a bright future but then I also want to experience and have fun my college years .  So I have to learn how to set priorities to my life .  I miss my high school life and I know that I could never go back to it .  But I feel like I have truly lived my senior year of high school .  High school was fun because I made friends I know I would keep for a lifetime .  They are the ones I would call up if I 'm upset or the ones I do n't mind crying to .  But in college , I feel like , no one really gives a damn about you unless you had some history with them .  My classmates here , we 're all in competition and the only ones I could turn to for now are the friends I had in high school .  I just feel more comfortable being around them because I know that they 've seen me through a lot of situations .  I wish I could make more friends here at UT because its such a big campus and I want to be well connected .  So I have started going to CBS and that 's helping a lot I think not only because I meet people there but also it calms me down .

It really got on my nerves .  Not because I 'm jealous , just because it was like her twin and being around that was just an odd situation .  Rob is really annoying me .

Soon those heartless boys will do something so horrendous , and the girls trust in men will be shattered for good and ruin all relationships in the future .  Aaaand I 'm spent .  That was so lame .  Bullshit , as my English teacher would say .  He is really cool .  He made us write about a chair the other day , which was very interesting .  And he taught at Pomona , which is my Harvard .

I was also thinking about yesterday because it marked one year since I 'd left for Venezuela .  I ca n't believe it was a year ago yesterday when I started my time there .  I miss it so much and would love to return .  There are so many things the country has to offer and see .  Granted there are lots of political problems and I just received the other day from the Embassay down there a letter that said there are cases of Yellow fever ( or something like that ) in some of the states .  I was down there for 10 months .  I lived with two families .  I went with the Rotary Youth Exchange Program .  I had a rough time for a few months .  The hardest time was when there was a nation-wide strike which lasted for 2 months !  Everything during that time was shut down .  Companies stop producing .  Ran out of harina pan y cervezas .  Tenemos q hablar en ingles o es espanol bien ?  Quiero practicar escribiendo mi espanol porque ahora aqui no hay muchas vezes donde puedo escribir cual cosa en espanol .  My spanish is not perfect .  Far from it .  I have been speaking for about 7-8 months now .  The first 4 months I was there I spoke mostly English .  That is a horrible thing to do if you are trying to learn another language .  One reason I did n't learn in the first four months was because the first host family that I had lived with spoke English , and there family members spoke english .  I met so many people who knew english .  That is awful for me because everyone wanted to speak and practice there english with me .  I wanted to practice spanish .  When I would try and speak in spanish with my host family they would respond to me in English .  So the first 4 months were n't the best .  I started to learn slowly thought once I made more friends and once I had switched families .  My second family was great !  My host mom was so nice to me and she would always talk to me and be more involved with me .  I started speaking and understanding the language more .  So by the time I left I had been speaking spanish for about 6 months , I wonder how much better I would be if I had spoke and learned during the first four mouths .  I broke away from the Rotary program in June and traveled alone for that month .  No one could travel with me , that was okay though because I was not going to miss out on seeing Venezuela for that reason .  One reason why no one could go with me was because there was no money and the eco system had gotten so bad because of that shit head president Chavez .

2128,"I really want to go take a nap but I ca n't because I have so much work to do .  That 's how it 's been since rush started .  Rush was when I really started feeling like my life was going through some changes that I did n't know if I could handle .  Now that 's it 's over and now that school is underway , the stress does n't seem to be going anywhere .  I always heard that college would be super stressful but never realized that what people were referring too was n't necessarily just the school work .  I thought I was SO prepared to come to UT , and I guess based on my high school education I am , but I was not ready for trying to mix sorority and social life ( one in which they expect you to go out every night ) with school and my goal of a 4 .  0 .  Now , for one of the first times , it feels like I 'm not going to be able to reach my goal .  I am so worried about it .  I already know what I want to do with my life , and that just makes it more stressful , because I know what I need to do to get there .  Oh well .  I do n't know what to do about Trey .  He is my boyfriend , or actually we 're on a break because he wants me to feel no extra pressure of feeling like I owe him time while I figure out UT and while I get situated with everything .  I did n't know someone could care about me the way he does .  And its so weird now because we always knew it would come to this and it just never seemed like it would matter .  I guess nobody really knows what to expect .  I spend more of my time helping other people and trying to make everyone in the world happy , that a lot of times I forget that my happiness is important too .  I guess that 's why me not feeling the need to make time for Trey has been good for me .  It gives me less stress , but it feels like more is missing than just him .  In everything I do I put my everything into it .  So just knowing that I am missing opportunities to make him happy and even to make my parents happy by taking time to go have lunch with them , is tearing me up .  This week my goal is to try to squeeze in school work and stuff , but also I am going to go to every social thing this week .  I really want to make sure I give this sorority thing time to show why everyone who is in it , is so in love with it .  My mom is real pushy about it .  And my brother .  I do n't think anyone in my family realizes that my brother and I are two different people .  I am not a partier , but we 'll see I guess .  I just really want to get good grades so I can choose where I want to go to medical school .  My brother had to go to law school in Lubbock because he did n't get in to UT 's .  He was upset .  I want to dictate my own future and where I want to go .  I just took that pretesting survey a few minutes ago and I thought it was interesting the variety of questions they asked .  I have a huge fear that someone is in the backseat of my car ALL the time .  Well , only at night , like when I get in it after I 've been inside or at someone else 's house .  I guess it 's better safe than sorry , but it gets old .  I do n't know if that fear was there before I heard about my mom or if it just got worse after it .  My mom has been through some stuff that I ca n't even imagine , and that I did n't find out about until this year .  That would be weird , determining when your kids are old enough to tell them about certain things .  Like her mom .

I do n't know now , but it still seems fairly interesting .  I 'm not trying to kiss ass there like I sometimes do , and am fairly good at by the way , I really think its interesting , for them most part .  like the lie detector test .  I found out how to beat on of those things .  just lie a lot , then tell the truth occasionally and switch it up enough that it confuses the shit outta the machine .  and also make sure that the investigator person does not know whether your lying or telling the truth , you know kinda play stupid .  lie when you do n't need to .  tell the truth but make it sound like a lie .  convince yourself its a lie even though you know its the truth .  heh my foot itches .  reminds me of that time in class you were talking about this assignment .  whenever you mention this stream of consciousness writing my foot always itches because you had that stupid itch comment .  it was not really stupid just annoying and it bugs me and it was annoying .  and it still is .  hey my typing has gotten somewhat better of the the last few minutes probably because I 'm not concentration so much of fixing my mistakes .  so you 'll just have to live with all my shitty typos so there ha !  yoo ca n't stop me because you just said write what on your mind and what if there are a lot of rtypes in my mind ?  hihn ?  huh ?  what u going to do about that ?  this charis too low .  there we go that is better but now it wo n't rock .",0,41,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,12,57,7,19,0,12,50,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,34,154,14

If I had a car , I 'd go to the grocery store and buy myself some more Myoplex ( protein shakes ) and some cereal and some milk , but my parents heard too many horror stories about first year college students flunking out of school because they drove their roommate to wrestling matches and out-of-town football games and such , so they would n't let me bring my car this semester .  If I had gone to school out of state , like both my brother and sister did before me , I would n't be getting a car for the entire first year , but since my school tuition is roughly one third of what theirs was , and I have some scholarships on top of that , my parents are considering letting me bring my car to Austin at semester .  I really do n't know where there 's room to park a Ford Expedition in this town , but I 'll find some place .  My car would have been nice to have last last Sunday morning , because there was a rowing team meeting at the boathouse , which is too far to walk to , and I ended up not being able to go because I could n't find a ride .  I was pretty upset , but My R.  A.  Danny , the one who talked me into trying out for the rowing team , told me to go to practice this morning anyway , and the coaches would n't mind .  He was right .  I just added my name to their list of names that they got at different meetings that I was n't able to attend , went through the workout , and they told me to come back on Wednesday .  It was a lot tougher than I would have thought , in some respects , but a lot less strenuous in others , when I look back at it .  The one mile jog was n't hard at all , and neither were the pull-ups , but eventually the sit-ups wore me out , and the jump-squats actually made me nauseous after a few sets .  I think that 's mainly because my legs were really sore from the gym the day before , which was a bad move on my part , but it 's hard to say .  I 've never done jump-squats before , so I might have felt sick afterwards without being sore .  We did n't get to go out on the water , which was somewhat disappointing , but the group of guys I was with are supposed to take a boat out on Wednesday , while the other groups run body circuits , since that 's all our group was able to do .  We did actually take a boat down to the dock , and set it in the water , but I was n't able to get in , and the boat never left the dock , so it was n't as much fun as it could have been .

After breaking up with my long-time girlfriend 6 months ago , I have n't dated any other person .  I think I 'm just lonely and miss the having a girlfriend "" lifestyle .  The girls I have met as friends I might have considered them possible girlfriend-material when in actuality they were n't , again because I missed having a girlfriend .  Recently , I 've gotten over the issue a bit .  I 've spent time with all my friends .  That 's the good thing about being single , you have more time for your friends .  When I was going out for my ex , which by the way the relationship lasted nearly 3 years , I did n't have much time for friends .  Not only that , but I chose to be with my girlfriend as opposed to my friends .  This issue of mine , it 's made me a bit more self conscious .  I got the idea in my head that looks really do matter .  Seriously though , having a "" deep "" relationship is important and yadda yadda , but I really do feel that looks matter too .  A friend and I were discussing this .  She is been there for me a lot .  When I broke up with my ex-girlfriend , she was there for me to complain to .

My roommate just left to go to her pledge party , and I really wish I was hanging out with her rather than doing this assignment about a week and half before it is due , but I guess it is better to do it now than to wait till last minute .

The fist thing I have to do before I leave is get all my homework done , including this assignment that I did n't want to leave for tomorrow because then it would keep me awake all night just like all my homework does .

I hope and pray that as time goes by I will learn to better deal with all the pressures associated with college life .  It has been so hard to find a way to balance the fun with the work .  But as my brother once told me , you must work hard in order to play hard .  I 'm trying to keep that thought in my head constantly , and keep thinking positive about my situation .  I 'm hoping that I can pull it off and walk away from this first semester satisfied with my accomplishments and confident about my college semesters to come .  Well enough about that .  I 'm really starting to miss my family a lot .  I think that is really lame but I ca n't help it really .  Like I love Austin and school and everything but there is just something about my good ole hometown of Sunnyvale , Texas that I miss incredibly .

One of my best friends from back home is coming to visit and I keep thinking about what we are going to do all weekend !  Gosh you know what .  I 'm really starting to worry about the whole freshman 15 "" theory !  Because I sure do eat a lot these days .  The food is just constantly in front of you so its difficult to resist !  Its not like at home where you have to make yourself something because your mom refuses to wait on you .  No here the food is just there and all you have to do is go to it !  Its great !  Its amazing to me how different college life is from high school .  Like in high school everyone cared about everyone else 's business and there were like cliques and stuff but not here .  No one cares about anyone else 's business at all .  people are just concerned with themselves .  And another thing that is so great is the total absence of rules !  Like you can do whatever the heck you want and NO ONE will tell you that you are wrong or that you ca n't do something .  Oh it really makes me laugh how in college classes if you suddenly get the desire to get up and walk out of class while the professor is talking , you can !  I laugh every time I see people doing that in my classes .  I would never be able to make myself do that because I 'm too much of a chicken but I think its so funny !  Gosh .  I 'm really starting to get hungry again .  that is so bad !  NO !  I ca n't eat again !  I am really not looking forward to going to class again at 7pm .  that is really late and I 'm extremely tired !  I really hope that I can find a date to Anchors Away .  that is really bugging me .

Alright well the time on this thing is officially almost over so I 'm going to stop babbling about stuff that no one is interested in except for me .  haha !

2207,"I 've been thinking a lot lately on the topic of studying other people , using them as test subjects , objectifying human beings , I really feel that it degrades their very being .  I do n't understand another human 's need to study and examine what makes another human tick .  I wish that I could say that I am exempt from this curiosity , but sadly I am not .  I find myself hypocritically fascinated by the way that people lose themselves in their jobs , in causes , in religion .  They somehow manage to pound it into their heads that whatever it is that they 're involved in is important , means something , when in reality 100 % of professions and causes are just as pointless as the lives of the people lost in them .  None of it will rally matter once these people are gone , and the strange thing is that I think they all know this deep down , they 've all had that thought in their life before .  Yet they still go on , slaving their lives away , building the modern day pharaoh 's modern day pyramids .  Just pawns to those that were lucky enough to be born into wealth .  God only knows what they would do if they were forced to face the reality of their banal situations .  Which raises another good topic , religion , now everyone knows that religion is make-believe for grown ups , just another thing to keep perpetuating the myth that our lives matter in some deep and profound way .  Religion as we know it was made to control the masses , sort of a justification for law , and also something that keeps people inline above law , like a conscience .  But the religions that we have come up with are so ridiculous we have to implement them to our young at ages when they are too young to tell the difference between real and fake .  We teach them religion as fact when they are too young to differentiate for themselves the difference between fact and fiction .  It 's funny that we act as if what religion we pick matters , as if one is even different that the others , they all have the same common goal to keep people living in the hierarchy , keep believing that by divine right the rich were born to a life of comfort and luxury and the poor must suffer in order for rich to have such pleasant lives .  In tribal societies religion does n't have to be forced on the new generation , rather they welcome it with open arms , just as they are n't forced to work in their lives , rather they do it out of necessity and a primal urge to conform to your own society .  People allowing themselves to be controlled really bothers me , it 's clear that people can live , sustain life , off very little , and will slave their lives away rather than die .  However I ca n't comprehend how our society got to this point , where the slave drivers now wear a smile while fucking people in the ass .  We somehow fib ourselves into believing we need cell phones , computers , tv 's , cars , when it 's a fact that none of these things even existed 50 years ago .  People actually lived without any of this bullshit for 3 million years , people just like you and me , people just as smart , and just as naive .  It 's clear that society breeds evil not the other way around , the pilgrims committed mass genocide on the indians , but it is forgiven as they were just spreading the one right way to live , that we have so enlighten found .  People lived without all this none-sense that we tell ourselves we could n't live without for nearly 3 million years .  But those are all things that no one wants you to know , except maybe Daniel Quinn , Derrick Jensen , John Zerzan , and Chuck Palahniuk .  Those are the men that will save our planet and our existence if it is n't already too late .  The doomsday clock is set to 40 years from now , that is the point of no return , if things stay the way that they are now , there will be no hope for the future .  If we had all just stayed with animism , and believed that the earth is not something for us to own , or control , if we would acknowledge that we are the weakest animal alive in that we are totally and utterly dependent on other animals giving their lives so that we may survive , how could we take away their right to the same land we live on .  But there are no classes teaching what people really want to know , what they need to know , only classes perpetuating our way of life .  Only classes brainwashing the brainwashed so suddenly that we do n't even notice .  So why study me when there are billions of other mindless zombies in this world .  Now I realize that my writing may sound bleak , as if I 'm in a state of utter depression , that I 'm innately sad , but it 's my very strong belief that with the world the way it is everyone should , and deserves to feel the depression that haunts us all .  We keep on trying to come up with ways to hide from ourselves the atrocities being carried out everyday by white collared crooks , making executioner executive decisions .  But humans should n't need pills to control their feelings , they should n't need pills to make them happy , they should n't need pills to force their inner feelings into submission .  It pains me very deeply to see the day to day transfer we are making into a controlled society , and the people that do n't see it , if it is n't already here .",0,41,9,0,2,0,0,0,8,9,72,7,13,0,6,28,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,26,169,0
2209,"Seriously in my mind right now I have so many levels of thought that I can easily access by simply starting to think about something , Everything runs in these little spurts of thought but once I analyze them long enough they are all working together to form what I think is the cycle of my mind and it all works together simultaneously and perfect as the world is , because everything has its specific purpose .  A lot of things that I thought before were just meaningless pieces of metal and serve no purpose in the world are really there for means of our ( human ) use and that is what they are specifically there for .  Everything is for us .  Humans .  Everything .  We utilize this world as it is our lemon and we must make as much lemonade for ourselves as we possibly can .  This alternates from being a very good and positive thing to being a terrible and selfish thing that makes us thing that we all must worry about ourselves and no one else matters unless they are aiding us on our rise to the top of the pitcher of our own lemonade , making sure that on one takes any along the way .  If someone takes our lemonade , we must simply acknowledge its loss and move on but how much is too much ?  When and where is the point where the lemonade that is taken is too much and we need it back ?  But if someone drinks it then we ca n't get it back , so how much lemonade do we personally owe to others if we are making much more lemonade than they are ?  Notice please that this lemonade is still very much so a metaphor for what we provide for this world that works specifically for us .  Even the controversy in the world is there specifically to get others to be mentally in touch with ourselves and make sure that they know our way of thinking .",0,26,2,0,4,0,1,0,6,7,45,4,8,0,5,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,22,110,0

I guess whatever floats her boat though so whatever .  as long as we are ok with me going out and coming in whenever I want then we have no problems . last night was pretty fun .  I went to sixth street for the first time and had my first legal clubbing experience .  I kind of got hooked up with this guy that game with my friend so that was fine except he was n't that good of a dancer because he could n't keep up with my rhythm but it was fun anyways .  the funnest was on Friday when me and Kayla went to the hitching post where the iron spikes were having their recruiting party .  we drank and had lots of fun then we got to spend the night at this guys apartment that I met at camp Texas .  he was a counselor that I had spent the entire first morning talking to about just whatever .  I really did n't think anything of it at the time because I thought it would be like off limits to have any kind of fling with the counselors so I kind of kept my distance .  I e-mailed him once school got started just to see how everything was going and see if he still remembered me .  he did , which was good .  I was hoping he would .  I think I kind of like him but I have no idea what he thinks about the whole situation so I 'm not going to stress over because it is so not worth it .  and plus he is the guy and I grew up in a place where the guy always made the first move so I 'm not all about jumping in here with my opinion and try to get something started .  maybe that 's my problem .  when I want something I tend to let it come to me and I just wait around till something happens .  maybe I should go after the things I want .  speaking of things that I want , I applied to be a Texas lasso .

To form a tangible pillar of my individuality and soul .  I need to see my doubt , anger , passion , fear , fascination , and every substance of my mind materialize .

I want to absorb it so that I do n't miss an ounce of life .  I want to share every shape and substance of time , to reflect on all thoughts before me so that I can mold those after .

Many projects that I saw as the key to overcoming this inaction and dullness have fallen short .

My dad and I have been getting along a lot more lately than we have been , I know that I would regret it if I just gave up on us getting along and said fuck it , so I 'm glad we are at least trying to work things out .  He apologized to Jordan this weekend for all the things he said to him this summer .  Jordan came over and they had a talk on the back porch .  I stayed inside and folded laundry because I felt awkward and tense about the whole thing .  But apparently it went alright .  I need to talk to my dad and tell him that I appreciate him doing that .  I forgot to before .  Actually , I just realized now that that 's something I need to do .  Probably should have said it earlier .  I hope I did n't hurt his feelings .  Oh well , like I said , I felt awkward about the whole thing in general .  Which reminds me of a funny awkward moment I had today .  I was at the Union with Shelley , and I went to the bathroom .  Another girl was going in just as I was , and this made my shy bladder act up .  She went into one stall , I went into the other , and I just could n't go .  Well , she was n't going either , apparently , so we both just sat there for about a minute .  I was trying hard to relax and finally I peed a little , but then it stopped .  So the girl pees a little , and I pee a little more , but I still ca n't go all the way .",0,25,2,0,1,0,1,0,3,14,50,4,6,0,5,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,0,2,0,0,14,109,2

Lol that is if I smoked weed which I do n't I actually find that to be so stupid .  why do you have to smoke or drink anything to feel good about life .

2259,"So school has been interesting so far .  I 've come into this with preconceived notions of what it was going to be like , and I 've surprised myself to find that it would be completely different .  At the time , I have become increasingly known by a nickname that was n't even self imposed , I 've created a superficial personality that people associate with and attach themselves to .  People love "" dat Boi Tony "" but hey .  I guess I 'm not too mad about it .  it 's good in the end , in some ways , and in some ways not .  like for example , if I want people to know who I am , then they really do know who I am , and the introductory part of conversation is out of the way , but on the other hand , since people think they know who I am they wo n't bother to finish out the conversation and actually get to know who I am .  really who am I anyway ?  can it be defined by a label or name ?  does it matter if I am Anthony Derrell Williams , Tony , or Dat Boi Tony .  because some people can remember my name at all .  I guess in some facets it really is irrelevant , but nobody really wants to be considered irrelevant .  lol .  it 's like significance drives us , like a since of purpose , much like Agent Smith from the Matrix , but that movie was flawed in itself .  It had no purpose .  It started out as a great action flick that wanted to mean something in the end , but that just did n't work .  However Quentin Tarentino , did it right when I he made Kill Bill , it was a simple plot with a unique character development , and that was the important part .  many people thought that it was the action , but it truly was the characters that made the movie .  that 's why vol .  2 is better than vol .  1 , no matter what the next person tells you .  sure vol .  1 was composed of the best action sequences since the old Bruce Lee days ( who is still better than Jackie Chan and Jet Li ) , but the story itself is what should draw you .  on another note , a friend of mine has been dealing with several issues and decided he would post his thoughts and troubles on the internet for everybody to see , and now he 's getting chewed out by a lot of people because nobody really has it in their hearts to really care .  The problem here really is that he thinks he is opening his mind , but he really has closed the port and he has yet to mature .  he ca n't take in new ideas or criticisms to better himself , the thinks he is fine as who he is .  Emo SUX though .  I had no formulated opinion about it until I seen what it is doing to him .  he needs help .  for real .  the funniest part about it , is that my friend ended his cruel convo with him by quoting Nietzsche .  "" God is Dead .  "" which is a very interesting quote .  a statement made just to test the bounds of control that the state held on the people thought their interpretation of religion .  if the person blindly tries to refute the statement without the use of reason .  they are a tool , if they inject reason and use logic to prove why God is alive .  then they are less of one .  the point is , that the religious texts , such as the Koran , the Bible , etc.  were written by man ( inspired by God ) , which means they are subject to flaws .  inherently and maybe intentionally , if you could tell the people "" thus said the lord "" and you did n't want them to kill or steal or eat shellfish .  then that 's what you 'd tell them .  after all some people read from texts translated by Shakespeare .  but I digress .  I as a Christian would only have this much to say in return .  if God is dead then that is irrefutable evidence to the fact that he existed .  And if he truly is God and did exist , Death has no binding power .  defining death would then become the point and focus of reason and logic .  What is death , what is death to a man , what is death to a beast , what is death to a god .  And then I would say .  yes , God in the form of man ( Jesus ) did die , for you and I.",0,22,8,0,2,0,0,0,5,13,57,2,8,0,7,28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,0,0,0,0,16,120,6

I wonder who my big sister will be in Phi Lamb .  Hmm interesting .  I love big sisters in organizations .  Which is kind of crazy because I just talked to my big sister from the drill team I was a part of in high school .  Random .

I ca n't believe that in ten years I will probably be married with kids and all that .  Oh my gosh .  Where has the time gone ?  I am actually excited about being a mom .  My mom was amazing .  She may have some interesting points of view and be a little too concerned with my appearance but you have to love her .  No one can argue like her that 's for sure .  I miss her .

I ca n't wait to show her around now that campus has started to feel more like a home .  Which is totally crazy .

My day started at 6:30 today because I have an 8 o'clock class which is really fun .  not as fun as this class but fun non-the-less .  then I went to my medical terminology class which could be more fun but its hard to make a class that is based on memorization fun .  then I had a break from 10 to 3:30 which would really suck if I did n't have plans .  so after my class I went to jester then met up with a friend of mine an signed up for a I 'm flag football team .  well anyway , I 'm not even sure if I 'm doing this assignment right because all I am doing is describing what I did today .  any way I really enjoyed today 's material in class .  at first I was n't sure if I would like the class but now I really believe that it might be my favorite class right now .

I am going blank right now but hopefully something will come to mind .  On yeah , I got to talk to my parents today which was n't too bad .  My dad did n't say much because he had football practice but he said that the team was coming around which is always good to hear because he puts a lot of effort and time into his work .

There have got to be some better relaxation techniques that I should try in order to sleep , because I am always tired .  When you are always tired , it is difficult to get everything accomplished because your mind and body just do not cooperate .  I wonder how much power the mind actually has over the body .  Maybe that is something that we will discuss in class .  I find the topic very interesting .  It is amazing how much more conscientious you become of your thoughts when you are trying to track them .  It seems to make you lose some of the negativity or criticism that usually passes through one 's mind .

2306,"Wow I ca n't believe I waited this long to write this paper .  I was in a shock when I found out that this was due tomorrow .  Deadlines motivate me more than ever .  I told myself that I was going to do this earlier or on some sleepless night but I guess getting it done is what is most important .  I just played some Starcraft with my roommate .  I used to play this game with all my friends from school before War Craft III came out for the computer .  This game ruined any chances for me to finish my homework .  I 'd have to say this game was the devil .  It made my parents really mad when they would walk into my room and find me playing in the middle of the game .  I told them I would shut it off after that game but it was too addicting .  My parents somehow figured out that I started a new game and threatened to throw my computer out .  This was n't a very good feeling .  Well , anyway , this girl from high school asked me to go to the homecoming dance with her less than 24 hours ago .  Somehow , all of my friends managed to find out in that amount of time .  This was extremely strange because I did n't tell anybody about this news .  I tried asking them where they heard this gossip but they refused to answer my questions .  This aggravated me just a little bit because my curiosity was at its peak .  A few friends from Houston already know .  I mean , what 's the big deal .  I do n't understand why gossip can travel so fast .  I guess it is because everyone wants to become involved in other people 's lives .  I think this knowledge makes them feel superior to others .  I find myself talking on instant messenger and the opening statement would be "" what 's up "" .  The basis of a conversation is what is going on with the other person 's life .  This type of conversation does n't really achieve much but it makes you feel like you belong .  Figuring gossip about yourself is a strange thing .  You never know who 's watching and points out the smallest detail to tell another person .  I figured my actions did n't speak THAT loud .  But any kind of gossip sparks a conversation like no other .  It immediately captures the center of attention .  I think people should be more concerned about figuring who they are .

2315,"As I sat down to start typing , my mind became filled with questions about this writing assignment .  A lot of times , I will start writing sometimes for no apparent reason about how I feel and will end up on a totally different subject and sometimes I will even start talking about the songs I 've heard and how past situations that have happened in relation to my feelings .  To be perfectly honest , I am thinking a lot about what my life once was like , all the good times , all the bad times , the lessons I 've learned and through which ways I learned them .  I must say I am definitely a thinker , and someone who dwells on the past .  Today has been a rather unusual day for me because I am somewhat sad but also happy at the same time .  I really miss my ex-boyfriend , who was also at one time my best friend .  It 's like I am missing a huge piece in my life .  I keep trying to figure out ways to go back in time , thinking what if , and if only I had done this differently .  The only conclusion I come to is that there was nothing I could have done or said differently , I guess the feelings just were n't there anymore and the basis of our at one time , great friendship was not built on a strong enough foundation to withstand tough obstacles set before us .  Yay , my favorite television show is on , well one of them anyways , 7th Heaven !  From watching that show , I become relaxed and more open-minded .  The lessons and values taught from it are in my thoughts , very useful in life and this day in time .  I could sit down and watch the shows episodes for days and not be bored because I like it so much .

2317,"This past weekend I took a short journey back to my home city of San Antonio , Texas .  I went there to get some more items from my house , and as you can tell I 'm still in the process of moving in all of my belongings into my dorm .  The dorm itself I like very much because it is a good enough distance from the university itself so that I can feel as though I am actually going home each day after classes ; plus the food here is excellent .  This semester so far has been going by a little slow just as the first few weeks of every school year do .  However , last week was very satisfying due to the fact that I got much accomplished .  I got much of my studying done and I finally got my book situation in order .  At first when I went to the Co-op I bought all these different books for each of the classes I am taking and then I came to discover that I did n't need about three of them .  So then I had to make time to go back and return the books that I no longer needed , and I had the pleasure of standing in the horrendous line it seemed they formed just for me .  This weekend I also went to the football game to see my favorite team in the land play a not-so-good team , but I still managed to have a great time .  I bought two tickets for my brother and my best friend who came in to visit me .  The day after the game when I went back to San Antonio I got to visit with my baby brother who is now about seven months old .  He is beginning to talk and make little noises that babies make .  I was a little sad to leave him so soon after his birth , but I will see him every now and then when I get a chance to journey back home .  I also got to spend time with my girlfriend of about two years .  We went out to eat and to see a movie .

A shake would taste good right about now .  Jester 2nd floor was good today , but not like I had expected it .  A lot cheaper though .  Its weird how they charge more if you use a different form of payment than Dine in dollars .  I 've always wondered why lunch is cheaper than dinner .  I usually eat as much or sometimes more at lunch than dinner .  So I wonder why most restaurants charge more for dinner .  It probably is the belief that people eat more at dinner , or maybe they are trying to pull in crowds at lunchtime because they are not as busy then .  Who knows and honestly who cares .  The room next door to us has a very squeaky door .  It slams hard .  Ouch my deltoid .  I am hungry , or maybe thirsty .  I really ca n't decide right now .  Ouch !  Wow 11 more minutes .  This has kind of gone by fast .  I thought it would take forever but it is an okay assignment .  And I 'm so glad I did my readings the weekend before .  It allowed me to have more fun time for me and time to do this assignment .  Those 30 seconds went by fast .  The people are always going in and out or maybe that 's just what it sounds like to me .

My mom is in the kitchen and watching the Republican National Convention .  I really should be watching it you because you see I 'm a government major ( at least that 's the plan right now ) .  However , and ironically , the very thing that is going to earn me my government major is also what is keeping me from watching the convention .  There now talking about Kerry not being a good leader but the AC which is located next to my room has just come on and now I ca n't hear .  Wow , this is getting a little weird having to make myself consciously voice in writing what I 'm thinking .  It 's amazing you can be so unaware of the thoughts that your own brain is thinking .

I have no history to work on but I have to work on some Latin and some astronomy and go to a help session .  I need to call Andrew and see if he wants to go see Thomas in College Station this Sunday .  I hope he wants to do that because I want to be here on Saturday so that I can watch the football game in Austin and spend time with Matthew and study Saturday .  I need to eat some lunch soon but I have some things I need to get done before that .  The lawn mower outside is very annoying , and I hate that there seems to never be a good time of the day for people to mow lawns .  Last year they would start the mowers at 7 when I was sleeping and it bugged the hell out of me .  There is a party on 6th tonight that I might go to but I am not sure of that , because I do n't really like the group of people that are going .  I do n't want Matthew to go to that party in North Austin because he will end up staying there , and that makes me uncomfortable .  This guy is going to Acc and his parents are going out of town so he is having a party .  That sounds a little bit like high school to me .  The people I have met from ACC just do n't seem to have work ethic and I just do n't understand how someone could not want to try their best to get far .  I have noticed that there are many people at this school that do n't think twice when they speak up , thoughts are never concluded when people begin to speak .  There is too much individualism , people only want to listen to themselves talk .  We live in a society where people are obsessed with themselves .  I find that in history very few people make educated assumptions when reading literature .  They pawn off what the professor says and act like it is their own words .  I love Bob Dylan , people always ask him what his lyrics mean and he always just says "" oh , their just words "" .  Its great , I love it .  I need to call my mommy today cause she called me last night , I saw this dog on campus today with its owner and it made me miss Emma at home .

I love dogs so much , I ca n't wait to be able to have my own .

I know its usually none of my business but I like to make people happy .  all of my friends tell me that 's a bad quality because I never end up doing what I want .  but the thing is I do n't want to hurt anyone especially those I care about .

I mean it would be okay if it were at home because that 's like our toilet and I kind of know the germs around .  but this is used by four other girls and eeeeek I just ca n't think about it with out cringing .  college is about cleaning bathrooms or learning how to .  I guess I 'll get used to it .  Its going okay so far .  I mean its fun and all but I do n't know .  I really really miss home .  Its weird not coming home to your family everyday .

I told daddy about the Normandy scholar program that I was interested in , but I knew that he was not going to let me go or really try to apply .  I think that my parents are way to protective of me sometimes , but I know it is for my own good because oh !  I might get in some accident over there and they will not be able to help me , but seriously , if I get into a really bad accident there should be people in Europe who would help me by the way the Normandy scholar program is this thing where part of it you spend three weeks in Europe going to old world war II sites and you learn about world war II , which I think is interesting partially because I seem to be weirdly interested in wars and stuff , maybe that 's why I like Ender 's Game so much .  but I also like band of brothers !  which got me interested in world war II in the first place !  and my favorite movie is black hawk down which is also kind of about a war , but more like a battle .  I 'm thinking about bringing my DVD 's to school , but one they might not fit into my tiny suitcase and two they might distract me because I 'll want to watch them instead of studying , like how my roommate and I stayed up until 2:30 for the past 2 nights watching Chinese soap operas .  I think it 's really funny because I am not really into girly stuff and the acting is so bad in these dramas but they sort of just suck you in and you have to finish watching them , like when you watch anime , speaking of which I need to see if the next Full Metal Alchemist episode is out or maybe I will just borrow it from my buddy .  She 's crazy but I like how she is protective of me .

I 'm feeling kind of gross , actually .  I feel gross because it 's the end of the weekend and I was out partying the whole time .  I hate when people are like , "" yeah I party "" , but I seriously did the whole weekend .  now I feel dirty and gross .  I also ate like crap this whole weekend .  ew .  during the week I 'm so healthy and so conscious of what I eat , and then the weekend comes and it 's like I 've never seen food before .  what is that about ?  so now I feel gross because I feel like I ate the entire state of texas and I 'm disgusting .  I 'll get over it .  I kind of miss camp right now , even though I would never go back .  I miss sam israel and hilly and weisberg .  those three are like my favorite people in the world .  this time seems to be going by so slowly .  I feel like I 've been writing forever and I have n't .  weird .  so back to camp .  I miss it because I was so comfortable and so happy .  here , I 'm not used to everything yet .  and I miss those three girls because I know that they will always be there and I 've known them forever .  I 'm still getting to know people here , which is fun because I love to meet new people , but sometimes I long for that feeling of comfort and not having to impress or look good for anyone .  you know what I mean ?  and I also miss adam .  this is something I could talk about for a while but I do n't really know if I want to .  it 's our 4 year anniversary in a couple of days but the card and present that I sent him wo n't get there on the 8th , I feel kind of bad about that .  what can I do ?  it was so weird when ross called me the other night , what the f ?  I 'm running out of things to talk about .  I love traci , my suitemate .  I knew her from camp and I 'm really glad we decided to live together .  despite what everyone said , I knew it would be a good decision .  we 've been getting along really well .  I 'm thinking about "" friends "" right now because it 's my favorite show .  I love it so much , and I 'm so sad that it 's over .  but I 'm excited to watch "" joey "" on Thursday .  I 'm definitely going to support him even if the show sucks , though I doubt it will .  this is random but I 'm going to run out of soap and shampoo soon , I 'm going to have to go to eckerd 's to buy more , and I need to return some books to the co-op outlet because there were some books that I did n't need .  hopefully I 'll get store credit , and then I can buy some stuff .  that would be awesome !  I need to return my chemistry and old psychology book .  I found out that I was in the chemistry class for science majors , and let me tell you that I 'm the furthest thing from a science major .  I hate science .  well I do n't hate it but I definitely do n't belong in that class .  so I switched into chemistry in context which is for sure more my pace .  and I actually swtiched into this class after classes had started and I found out that I bought the wrong book .  I just figured something out about me .  I hate bad spellers .  so random , I know , but I see myself typing and every time I 'm about to spell something wrong or I mistype , I get so angry .  I do n't know how people can just leave words mispelled .  I hope nobody reads this because they 'll think I 'm such a weird kid .  which I am , but not everyone needs to know that .  my brother , danny , always tells me I 'm a weird kid .  he 's so funny .  and whenever I talk about him to other people , they always ask how old he is , and then they are surprised when I tell them that he 's 16 , because the way I talk about him , it sounds like he 's older .  danny always gives me orders and bosses me around , but in a funny way , not in a serious way .  people always make fun of our family by calling us the "" brady bunch "" because no one ever seems to fight in my family .  I do n't know why , but we all just get along .  my older sister is my best friend in the entire world .  sure , we get annoyed with each other every once in a while , but she is absolutely the first person that I go to with a problem and she 's the first person I tell things to .  and danny is awesome .  there 's nothing not to like about him .  he 's so cute , nice , smart , funny , he 's a great catch .  some day , girls are going to fall all over him .  they should .  me and andi ( my sister ) always say that we would date danny if he was n't our brother .  he 's such a cute kid .  I 'm kind of mad at him though because I have n't talked to him in a really long time and he said that he would call me and he did n't .  I hate when people do that .  I really do n't know what else to talk about .  I guess I can go through my high school friends and talk about them because then I 'll have plenty to say .  I hope that 's still following the assignment .  so I 'll start with olivia geyelin .  I do n't even know why I 'm writing about her because she sucks .  I mean , I hate this girl .  she might be the dumbest person I know , and she 's always complaining and never knows what 's going on .  she gets mad at everyone for the dumbest reasons .  ew .  but I kind of feel bad for her because she 's got the worst family life ever .  ok I 'm sick of olivia , now I 'll talk about rikki spreckman .  ok , I used to love rikki , she was so sweet and nice and always smiling .  and then I realized how selfish and dumb she was .  I hate sounding like a bitch but I ' m starting with the people I like the least and working my way to the good ones .  ok so rikki , sweet girl , adorable , but so dumb .  and she 's best friends with hillary , who I 'll come back to later , but it annoys me because hillary 's one of my best friends and I hate how much time they spend together .  I 'm not jealous , I just know that hillary could do so much better than rikki , but rikki seems to need hillary .  and I feel bad for hill because a lot of people do n't like rikki , and so they 're always talking about her and then people assume that because hill is so close with her that she sucks too , which is so not true .  but I 've known rikki since junior high .  ok now on to sarah salon .  I used to hate sarah .  she 's a bitch .  not kidding .  and she 's intimidating as hell , but only if you take her seriously .  now I like her a lot more because I 'm not scared of her and I do n't take her shit .  she has two older sisters who might be the meanest people ever , and she tries to act like them but she 's so much better than them .  sarah had a boyfriend for a really long time , and so her and I were always able to have really great conversations about boiyfriends and relationships .  she 's always so much fun to be around .  I like her .  but her and rikki had this whole feud going for a while and all she would do was talk about rikki and how much she hated her .  I 'm wondering if this timing thing is accurate because I really feel like I 've been doing this forever and every time I 'm typing , it seems like the seconds do n't go by , but every time I pause , the seconds go by quickly .  maybe it 's in my head , I do n't know .  but it 's weird .  I 'm going to start looking at another clock to see how much time has gone by .  ok after sarah , I only have favorites left .  everyone else left , I genuinely love , they 're my best friends .  I 'll start with lizzie albert .  Elizabeth Chandler Albert .  I met lizzie freshman year and we were instantly best friends .  I 'm not kidding , I loved her so much and we could always talk about anything and laughed so much together it was ridiculous .  and we were always on the same intellectual level because we were pretty much the same ( but she was smarter ) .  in our group of friends , we were the smartest .  we were bff , I swear and then junior year , our friends kind of got in this fight and we did n't talk for a really long time .  it really bothered me .  I 'm not joking .  it killed me that she did n't want to talk to me and I did n't understand .  it was so bad .  we were never the same again .  but at the end of senior year , we got close again , and now I think we 're really close , like reverting back to three years ago .  I miss her so much , she goes to wisconsin .  she 's probably having the best time .  I ca n't wait to go visit her .",0,75,11,0,2,0,0,0,6,42,145,4,24,0,27,120,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,10,0,0,0,0,30,336,16

I have to read so many pages for all of my classes except math .  I was worried about math but so far , it 's my easiest class .  Well , I guess it 's good that it 's not hard too .

They 've been playing reruns nonstop since like Wednesday .  This week is going to be a lot less stressful than last week because Monday and Wednesday are my busy days .  I want to get out of the city next weekend .  Maybe I 'll go visit some friends at Texas State or go to the lake .  I have n't been swimming in really long time .  I remember swimming in my neighbors pool as a kid more than I remember swimming in my own pool .  Maybe because it was more exciting since my family did n't have one at the time .  Our dog would always run around the pool and bark at every splash we would make .  The trees in our backyard would always have bees buzzing around it but I never once got stung .  The lotion sitting on my desk is about to fall over but that 's ok because nothing can spill out .  Well maybe twenty minutes is n't a long time because I 'm over half way done .  The game on Saturday was really fun .  Once the sun went down it was much more enjoyable .  UNT did n't do very well .  I almost went there instead of UT just because its close to home and my sisters went there .  On the other hand , it was maybe a little too close to home .  I do n't know why I bought a thesaurus and dictionary for college when I have a computer sitting right in front of me .  Its about twice as fast to look up a word on google than it is to look it up in a book .  I hear a lawnmower outside .  I feel sorry for whoever has to do gardening on Labor Day .  My neck is starting to hurt from staring at the computer screen for so long .  I should trim my fingernails .  They keep getting in the way while I 'm typing .  I have n't seem a movie since I came to Austin .  I do n't even know where a movie theater is around here .  Better yet , I do n't know what is playing right now .  I have n't seen any previews either .  Someone must be sick because I keep hearing coughing coming from the hallway .  People go out way too much .  I ca n't go out on a school night without feeling badly .  I always want to wait for the weekend .  I 'm sure that will change shortly though .  This has been a very long weekend .

Let 's see what 's on my mind .  ok I think I need to turn off the TV and maybe turn on a little music .  this seems like it could get boring .  hmm .  maybe that 's a bad sign that I think my thoughts are goig to be boring .  anyway , all right , the tv 's off and now the musics on .  much better .  well I 'm officially pledging phi delt tonight .  I 'm going to be assigned my big brother at the meeting this evening and I 'm pretty excited .

I need to get khakis and a white shirt for tonight .  hmm I wonder what I should do about shoes .  I did n't bring my dress shoes I do n't think .  that 's one bad thing about being 8 hours from home .  when I remember something that I forgot to bring , or did n't think I would need , there 's not much I can do about it .  ok what else do I need to do today .  its labor day .",0,25,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,10,44,8,17,0,4,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,2,4,0,0,10,111,4

I am already getting tired of writing and I think I am going to go to sleep early today so that tomrrow I can go to the Gym and still not be so tired as today so that I can do more homework .

Hunger , football , and the giant pre-screening survey thing that I just took .  Can you believe that I finished it at 2:54 , only 6 minutes left before they stopped accepting them .  Man talking about some pressure .  Speaking of pressure , I just thought of physics , which is kind of weird since I do n't have physics this year .  I do have math though .

We tied in the end .  ^ _ ^ Wow , ok , so now that I typed ^ _ ^ , I thought of anime and forums since I use that on forums all the time , and it 's an anime face .

Of well , did you know that I learned to type too early that I lifted my hands off the keyboard so I could type faster since , I had small hands .  And so in I think 10th grade I had to fix myself , and retaught myself 10 finger typing .  Cause you see this "" hover hands "" typing caused me to look at the keyboard .  The song just changed and it totaly distracted me .  Speaking on Song , I met a girl named Helen Song , the first Day of Psycology and she 's really cool .  I like her a lot as a friend but at the same time I want to ask her out .  But you know that my biggest fear ( and pretty much the only one ) is losing a friend .

I was mad at him and then hung up with him , then I called to apologize and he was mad at me for being mad at him .  It was just one big drama over nothing .  I guess I made him extra angry because he told me he needed to sleep it off otherwise he might say things he really did n't mean .  That ofcourse made me sad , because all I wanted to do was say sorry and just talk to him .

I step ouside and inhale , a cold rush of life crystalizing in my lungs .  This is where I realsize that everyday is but a breath .  That single inhale was a day , was a life .

My eyes desperately search for ideas , while I know they are all within some governing organ I possess .  Heart or head , it does n't matter .  but I find it odd that my eyes do the searching .

We are so strange .  I see people trying to avoid the world as they bounce down the gravel paths with an iPod pumping sound into their skulls .  People who try to look sexy .  People who look mad at the world , and sneer at you , the person mearly trying to understand some fraction on their existance and importance .  People look at me too .  What is it that I possess that makes their eyes flick up for even an instance to make contact with mine .  My heart races when they do that .  It 's kind of a love .

I guess it 's typical for for an incoming freshman , since it 's new and all .  I 've never felt so busy in my life .  Watching TV , my old passion , seems like such a waste of time to me now .  If I have spare time , I could actually be checking out Austin , like the duck boat , which our RA told us about .  It seems so cool ! !  A tour bus turning into a boat ? ?  It 's craziness , and a little scary .  We supposedly may go as a hall , which I highly doubt because we do n't seem to have hall unity or whatever .  I guess I had a misconception of how dorm life would be .  At this point , I think getting an apartment would have been just fine , other than the fact that I 'm way closer to my classes living on campus .

So yea , back to the stressed out business .  I 've had something to do since the beginning of summer , since I took summer 1 at a community college , then I went to Clinton , Oklahoma to see my baby nephew and help my brother and sister-in-law out with the hotel they own there .

2382,"When I think about what I 'm thinking , a void pops up .  I guess because the brain never really stops , it 's hard to pinpoint an exact thought in any moment .  I can recall past topics that have rambled through my mind however , so that 's what I 'll dicuss .  A topic that 's popluar in my brain is my boyfriend ( surprising right ? )  I think about how happy I am in our relationship and how much of a good friend and boyfriend he is .  He goes to college at Trinity University , which is in my hometown of San Antonio .  We see eachother nearly every weekend , so it 's not hard to sustain the relationship .  Though , I constantly wonder if he really does care about me .  He tells me that he does , and I know that he does , but I 'm really insecure about that issue .  My insecurity on that issue stems from my past relationship where my then boyfriend would tell me that he cared about me , but ended the relationship somewhat abruptly without any sign or signal .  That 's probably why I worry so much about it .  However , I am really happy in my relationship .  I have no complaints except for my own lack of security .

It really is terrible because it 's like the stink of the cologne is like a glue and has stuck to everything in our room .  Especially all my clothes , which has made me start to smell like him .  Oh I hate it .  I always want to say something , but it would be weird saying to him that his designer cologne smells like ass and that I could make the scent personally with some onions and curry .

I do n't get why classes are so boring there 's no point in taking a chemistry class if I 'm going to be a business major and my friends are being so freaking loud and I ca n't concentrate and I do n't know what I 'm typing I 'm not even paying attention .  there 's this girl who got in a car accident and the air bag blew out her eye and she 's suing hte company or something I do n't know .

I have to wait till Monday 1AM .  That 's when he got his spare key from HOUSTON !  My room is so not-neat right now .  I need more time !  I went to my sister 's friend 's apartment just now .  His place is so messy .  I guess the place that I live in is not bad at all .  The psy class is so huge .  I am in TIP classes .  Most of the classes are not in the big auditorium .  I am excited about being a college students .  I met a lot of new people .  People from different cities .  There is a badminton club in UT Austin .  I am joining it for sure .  I love playing badminton .  However , in my high school , we only played badminton during PE for a week or so .  I wonder why people here do n't like badminton that much .  Bio is so interesting .  I like chemistry too .  However , there are some serious reading that need to be done at home .  On top of all those , there are in-class quizzes and discussion that I have to attend .

Now I 'm starting to remember what was said in class about this assignment .  It seemed like a really dumb assignment to do , but I prefer writing for only twenty minutes versus actually drafting up some essay and spending hours writing and rewriting and losing sleep over it .  There really is n't much too this , which should 've been fairly obvious to everyone in class .  Why is it that no matter where you go there 's always someone really really stupid that 'll ask the same question that someone else asked only a few seconds before them .  If I was a teacher that would really annoy me .  It would be fun to put those dog shock collars on those types of people , you know the ones that everyone growns inwardly ( and sometimes outwardly ) at as soon as they open their mouth because nothing good will come out .  I actually really do like the psych class .  The assignment is aggravating because I know that odds are no one will ever read this and I 'm doing it just for my own amusement .  I know if I cheat and just copy and paste something or bang on the keyboards for 20 mins , then I 'll feel bad about it .  Oh well , 20 minutes is n't that big of a deal anyways .  I 'm killing time until my boyfriend gets done with his project so I can talk to him again .  My mind is trying to go into thinking about my bf , but I 'm not going to let that happen .  I know that most people have a hard time making a "" long distance "" relationship work when the distance really is n't that far .  All the girls I 've met left a bf in Houston or Dallas .  I wish that 's how far away he was because I could go and see him on the weekends .

Not too much stress and I talked to a lot of my friends and family .  Its always nice when I get to talk to old friends from hs .  today I met a girl that went to the same elementary as me .  we did n't know each other , but we had a connection because we were from the same town .  MOst people have never heard of my town before , so it was pretty cool .  I also met a girl this morning that went to the other hs in my town , which again is strange .  I actually met a lot of people , one of the girls has a class with me and we live right down the hall from each other .  I 'm glad to know that I have someone that I can study with or ask a question if I need help anytime I want .  One good thing about college is that it 's really easy to make friends .

I 'm going to try out for the rowing team .  I think I 'm really going to enjoy the workouts and meeting new people .  I hope I make the team , but I do n't want to get my hopes up , so I 'm just going to see how it goes .  Today I went to the gym to see how difficult rowing really is and I feel much more comfortable with my decision .  I was able to row correctly , although it gets kind of confusing at times because it is not a natural movement .  but I was able to row for 2000 meters non-stop my first try , and I think that 's pretty good because I only have to row for 500 meters for the tryouts .

Anyways I have had so many hard days these past days butI think that I am going to be okay .  I do n't know why people do n't even talk to other people unless they know them .  Today I actually realized that eventhough austin is a big university I can make others see me .  Okay right now my feet hurt so much I did so much walking today just like the other days .  The difference is that I got blissters on my feet and they really hurt but you probably do n't want to know that .  Anyways I think I have lost weight because my pants fit me loose from when I bought them .  Which is good because I usually do n't loose weight or gain it just stay the same .  Oh if I misspell a word I am so sorry but its just that when I am happy I ca n't really concentrate on spelling .

I do n't feel like being here , my head hurts , and I smell burnt popcorn in the hall way .  I have a long day tomorrow and my last class is over at 5 .  I do n't know what the day will have in store for me , hopefully I will be able to focus on my studies and not worry about all this other stuff that 's bothering me .  I need to realize that I can make myself happy and I do n't need someone else to make me happy .  I do n't even know why I 'm rambling on about this , its just always in my head I suppose .

I wonder if this assignment is some kind of study that our professor is doing .  he did say that he and whoever helps him would not get around to reading these writings for a long time which makes me think that he is compiling some big database to look at find stuff out about people who take a beginning psychology course at the University of Texas and what makes them tick .  I wonder how many people will write about how they think that this is a dumb assignment .  how come my words are appearing on the screen on one huge line instead of returning to the next line ?

242,"I am reading a book called Atlas Shrugged and it is affecting my consciousness and belief system more significantly than any novel I 've ever read .  Ayn Rand wrote it and it 's just a metaphorical portrayal of her philosophy of Objectivism , but the book touches on subjects that I feel are very important to all humans .  I find myself newly enraged at those incompetent people of the world .  Not because they are incompetent but because they are the ones who ask for help and breaks and favors by those people who built the society in which we live .  The anti monopoly law is a perfect example of this .  Why should the men who built the country be penalized just to give the other people who were n't strong , smart , or productive enough a "" fair "" chance .  It really is disgusting .  Just as is , in the theater department they do n't allow one person to get too many leads in order to give other people a chance .  THIS IS STUPID .  If those others who would never otherwise get a chance ca n't cut it , then they do n't deserve a chance to begin with do they ?  I also notice the moral depravity of some of my friends .  These are the ones who are joining fraternities in order to get breaks when they go into the real world .  Personally I would hate knowing that I found my station in life by the grace of one of my old drinking buddies .  I would much rather know that my hard work , intelligence and talent got me to where I was .  But not many people think like this anymore .  I guess that I just have way too much faith in my abilities , but I 'm glad I do .  Ayn Rand is right in saying that incompetency should not be rewarded in society , but it is .",0,24,3,0,0,0,1,0,2,13,55,7,6,0,6,30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,14,113,2
2433,"I enjoy doing writing assignments liek these .  You get to write about just about anything that pops into your mind .  the bad part about this type of assignment is when you really do n't have anything to think about or when you have a brian fart .  I wounder just how my performance in this class is going to be .  Whether I will do poorly in the class or good or just average enough to pass the class .  But among those thought , I also wounder how this semester is going to go .  I hope that I am going to be able to do well enough to bring my GPA up so that I am able to get more scholarships fo next year .  Man , when I notice what I am thinking about , I notice that I really think about things that may affect me in certain ways .  Like doing homework for my classes or whether or not I 'm going to have enough money to pay my rent or my cell phone bill or my other bills .  But as I take the time to think , I feel that I will be forced to get another job so that I will be able to afford all this new responseablity that I have taken on .  Its not always easy to write exactly what your thinking about a certain time .  But right now its hard for me to do anything when all I 'm thinking about it how bad I feel right now .",0,11,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,6,14,2,7,0,1,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,49,2
2434,"I havent really decided what to write about .  so many things are going on in my head all the time it seems like I could write for a very long time .  I do that though , I have a journal and its handy .  I like to go back and read what I write and think to myself ' what an idiot ' .  its a learning experience really , and I hope more people use journaling to express themselves .  Some people use online journals which at first I thought was odd because I write personal stuff in my journal .  I would n't want the internet world to read all that .  but then I started reading my friend 's online journals and actually started one myself .  Katie calls me a follower but she is a conforming nonconformist in that she claims she 's not starting one because everyone else has done so and she 'd like to be different .  That reminds me of George , he is the classic conforming nonconformist .  he hates anything anyone likes and loves anything anyone hates .  especially lauren .  their relationship is odd in that way .  George makes a point of emphatically disliking something just to spite the rest of us .  he is an interesting person to study .  I am always observant but observing him is just interesting .  he 's like a girl and I swear he has PMS .  we went on a trip to kentucky this summer and he decided he did n't want to go to the lake with the rest of the group ( david and I did n't want to either ) so the three of us stayed in the condo and played golf actually .  but then the next day , he still did n't want to go and he made a big scene about it and then got all huffy when we Could n't decide on a thing to do when it started raining and the lake was deemed a bad idea .  he just left .  he drove off in one of the two cars we had and was gone for a long time .  the funny thing about chris is that he wants you to think he 's cool .  so he 'll do and say things to seem cool and crazy .  he went to a grocery store and was talking to some local teenagers and claims he was invited to go hang out with them that night .  I do n't know if I belive him but I really do n't care .  the point is that later he claimed that he ' might ' go hang out with them like he was mr. popular .  of course he was n't really and the way to deal with him in his pouty state is to ignore him or somehow let him know that you do n't care .  He is such a confusing boy .  I mean , they 're all confusing but he takes the cake .  having liked him before , I knew what I was getting into the last time .  and the time before that .  his biggest relationship flaw is that he is so flaky !  so now I feel bad like I 'm just judging everyone I know .  grr .  that 's a noise I make , I make many of them .  I make many faces too .  at work john laughs at me because I ca n't control my expressions .  especially if someone says something dumb .  I just ca n't hold it in .  my moms the same way .  I wonder if that 's learned or inherited .  anyway .  speaking of mom , my parents moved to florida in feb.  and march .  it was ok at first because I was of the opinion that I was getting an apartment so I would n't be living with them and would n't see them much anyway .  but man I was wrong .  I visited them in may and felt unusually emotionally detached .  while I was there dad did the same annoying things he 's always done , not listening , asking questions I 'd just asked etc.  drove me nuts .  but now I miss them a lot .  I was listening to Avril Lavigne and she has a song called nobodys home .  and I realized that I have no where else to go .  this apartment is my home now and man that 's depressing .  the kitchen is dirty , the floors are dirty , we need to steam clean , lauren and katie are bums and it took them 4 days to clean out MY cooler from Saturday which now reeks because they left food in there to soak .  people would call this bitterness .  I like to claim that at least I 'm expressing an emotion instead of keeping it all inside like I tend to do .  I took one of those personality surveys online the other night because neal showed me the website .  it said I was an ESTP ?  I think .  anyway , part of it said that I would tell people what I think .  I do n't know how correct that is because I am usually the person with enough tact to not say mean things and well pretty much ALL my friends will say crap .  Jill is the most tactless , when she and sean got together I was quite angry .  and still when I think about it I get angry at her .  why not at him ?  I do n't get that .  but when I typed his name I accidentally wrote sew .  I am thinking about buying myself a sewing machine because I keep thinking of things .  like today as I walked across campus I was thinking of different shirts and ' textiles ' to make .  I 've wanted to do stuff like that for a while but I just .  did n't .  and now , even though I 'm busy with papers to write etc , I really want to get creative .",0,46,16,0,0,0,0,0,1,22,61,7,6,0,15,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,2,0,0,0,12,172,12

Brandon is not very bright but I feel sorry for him because he does n't have many friends .

She said we were the last 5 people to get in and they had to take us so we did n't ( thank G-d ) have to go through it again .

I used to idolize berman .  I also liked dick vitale .  I was so obsessed that I wrote him a letter .  a few weeks later I got a copy of his book with a personalized note on the inside .

312,today if the first Sunday that I have been here alone and it is interesting because I do n't have my parents looking over my shoulder telling me what to do .  I can just walk out of my room and go have a cigarette .  this is different because before I would have to think up an excuse to go and have one .  my feet are cold right now and I need to take a shower .

313,"Well , it 's becoming quite obvious to me now that the homework is beginning to pile on , but I 'm perfectly okay with that because of all the stuff I went through last year in school .  I did one of these for my psy class in high school and I remember some of the stuff I wrote about was quite funny , but hey , it 's a stream of conscience .  I actually love doing these kinds of things because for the majority of the time , the way we think is a stream , and it 's never-ending .  I really want to play tennis sometime soon , but today I just do n't have the energy .  I wonder when I 'm going to get physically ill from staying up so late every night , and changing my habits a great deal .  I 'm getting quite used to the college way of life now .  It 's rather scary that I 'm becoming more and more comfortable with calling my Jester dorm "" home "" .  I definitely miss my bed in my real home .  I wonder what else I have to do tonight .  I love having all the assignments , tests , papers , quizzes , etc.  ahead of time so I can plan ahead and not be able to blame my teacher if I forget something .  This is really good for typing practice .  I love my schedule , yeah tomorrow 's a terrible day for classes , but are n't all Mondays terrible .  I ca n't believe my hand is cramping up already .  That has got to be a bad sign .  Sometimes I really am not sure if I 'd want people to know my stream of conscience .  At times it can make people sound very stupid , like now .  I 'm very excited I received a call from Jeff tonight , he 's such a great friend and I have n't seen him or talked to him since I left Albuquerque .  That 's a terrible word to spell , but hey , living there my whole life I should be able to do it in my sleep .  Oh , sleep , that sounds like a great idea .  I am way too tired to do anything , but that 's when I need to force myself , and just get into a studying groove .  I 'm really not looking forward to the noisy people that will be hanging out below my window tonight , playing guitar , singing , talking loudly , until early hours of the morning .  Then I 'll have to call down to the Jester desk again and complain .  They must hate me by now .  I wonder when I follow up for the psy experiments .  My roommate has way too much stuff around her desk , but she lets me use her computer , so it 's a fair trade .  I love typing , although crazy as it may sound , I do .  I am just itching all over .",0,20,4,0,0,0,0,0,5,12,26,3,10,0,5,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,0,0,0,0,16,85,2

I tried out for the soccer team and did not make it , but that was a little unfair because I did not know the work out to prepare for and everyone else did .  So now everyone probably thinks I just was n't good enough when that really was not the reason .  I was just too exhausted after running to play with any skill .  Oh well .  I guess it taught me how to cope with failure .  But it really hurts every time I fail .  I tried to get into the business school and was denied .  That got me so mad .  There are all of these total morons in the business school .  I know because I take classes with them and always make better grades than them .

Rather than be rejected I 'm just not going to try but then I 'll always wonder whether or not I could have made it if I had tried .  If I do try out and then I fail everybody will know that I FAILED AND I 'll be embarrassed .  I risked failure when I pledged but I did it anyway .  My neighbor failed and I did n't think any less of her so why should I think any less of myself .  I 'll look fat in the leotard and tights , but one reason I want to do it is so I 'll stay in shape .  Everything is too competitive .

Then the picture frame I got today since I have a picture of my cat but I have to get another frame for my cat picture .  My entire room is decorated in cat things .  I found a gecko in my room today .  There not have as big as the lizards we used to find in the house when I lived in Arizona .  they used to be at least a foot long .  I wonder what I 'm going to do tomorrow I have reading to do in the morning .  I ca n't help but put in capital letters at the beginning of sentences and periods .  My mom wanted me to copy this and run spell check , how stupid .  that what you get for having an English teacher for a mother .  I want to get a calendar to put up all my things .  I 'm scared to death I 'll miss something like a homework assignment or test .  I wonder if I need to be studying more often .  It seems like I 'm not doing enough .  I do n't know what I 'll do if I fail .  I hope I 'm doing this write .  It seems like the paper is just going on and on and on .  I seem to worry about failure alot .  I hate typing , I never memorized where the keys were so I keep goofing .  My parents always told me to take typing but I was too lazy and afraid I was going to not get an A.

It makes me want to fall asleep sometimes when I read it .  The most interesting section was about the animals on the Plains .  The little jackrabbit has a white patch on its butt so that whenever it is in danger or something it flares it up to communicate with it 's own kind .  I guess that 's how it works .

I tend to do that a lot sometimes .  Right now I 'm feeling a bit hungry cause I only ate a small bit of food for breakfast ( at 1:00 pm that is ) .  Yes I feel very well rested too cause I slept till noon .  speaking of food it reminds of this lady who works in the cafeteria at the place I 'm staying at .  I do n't like her very much because she said something about me in front of my face to another worker in Spanish .  she assumed that I did n't understand what I said but let me tell you -- I did n't take five years of Spanish and not learn to understand the language .  also I did n't work with Hispanic people and not learn how to pick up a few words here and there .  so what really pissed me off was not what she said ( which really was n't that offensive at all ) but the fact that she would say it in a language she thought I would n't understand and more importantly she did it while I was still there .  oh here I go about things in the past .  I know I should just learn to let little things like that go but I can harbor a lot of my emotions for a long time , but they do eventually go away .  besides I 'm glad that I can know whether or not what I feel is justifiable .  never mind forget what I just said it does n't make any sense .  it 's hard to explain .  you know I wish I could type as fast as I think cause by the time I finish this sentence I 've already thought up of something else .

Currently my roommate is pondering why I listen to so much music all the time .  To tell you the truth , I really do n't know why I do .  One of the reasons may be that I grew up surrounded by music , my brother being a person that played a lot of it around the house , as well as the fact that a lof of my friends also listen to music a whole lot .  I just saw the MTV music awards , which was ok .

I hope my ride back home tomorrow is expedient .

In this summer alone , 4 of my close friends experienced breakups in relationships , either due to faults of their own , or others .  2 of them cheated on the other , which is something that is really bad .  I guess the human mind likes to think that when you commit to someone else , you expect the same in return , no matter if you are drunk , stupid , wasted , etc.  It 's prolly also the lowest of things that one can do to another in a relationship as well .

I do n't know how she could think that .  its really silly to think that someone would think that .  but kathryn said that brad may have told her that just to make her happy .  why would it make kathryn happy that I stalk kim , even though I do n't .  I guess cause now kathryn knows that someone hurt me as bad as I hurt them .  oh well , forget that idea .  kathryn and I are friends now so it shouldnt matter that I got hurt by kim .  it should make kathryn sad when I am sad .  I know it does cause she told me when she called me to see how I 'm doing .  so I know that brad was lying now .  kim never thought I was stalking her .  if she did why would she still talk to me .

685,"I have too much homework to do .  It is really different from high school where you could finish your homework in a couple of hours .  The homework in UT requires you to read a whole lot and complete an enormous amount of homework in a short amount of time .  Also , at UT , you must manage your time wisely becuase you are on your own and there is no one to bug you are pester you about your time management .  Also , there are a lot of distractions like girls , basketball , sleep , etc.  Going to early classes has been hard for me so far .  It is really hard to stay awake for the 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock classes becuase some are just too boring because of boring professors that like to lecture over meaningless material because no one understands it .  I think that if they should teach like they did in high school where they show examples of the things that they are talking about , or go at a slower pace so everyone can understand .  This is because once you are lost , you really do n't want to have to work really hard to get back up to speed .  I really think that my GPA is important this semester becuase I am trying to transfer into the business school and out of the college of natural science .  This is becuase I do not like computer science which is my current major , and business seems easier and a better track to go .  Today in psychology class we learned an intereting lesson on lie detection .  It kind of lost its point since the professor could not tell what the student 's number really was .  I want my parents to bring me a bike to UT .  It is because the campus is just too big and it is too hot to walk to all of my classes .  But I kind of do n't want a bike on one hand because it will mess up my hair , you will have to pedal over hills , and cars do n't really care about bikers as much as pedestrians .  I am kind of pissed that the school is closing Gregory Gym tomorrow because they are throwing the plaza party .  I think that they should have it somewhere else because a lot of people like myself like to play basketball there at night .  Plus it is already too congested at night because they hold volleyball games on other courts during the night too .  I really think that the UT football team is going to do well this year .  Although they blew a big first game , I think that they have a chance to do something either this year or next year .  I do n't understand why Chris Simms chose to come to Texas over Tennessee .  He is such a good quarterback to be a backup .  I think he should be starting over Major Applewhite even though he lacks experience because he has a good arm and he is more atheletic .  I really do n't like to do these things because it takes so much time .  When I first started typing I did n't realize how long 20 minutes is , but it is a long time .  When I finish this , I need to start on my english paper , and do my calculus problems . My calculus TA is really stupid because she can not teach us .

I went to knock at my neighbors ' doors and asked them if they had a printer I could borrow .  The lucky thing was that the second one I asked does has a printer and he let me borrowed it .  So the problem had been solved .  Then after this I kept on writing my Chemistry prelimenary write up .  I needed put the procedures and data table up .

But instead I decided to go ahead and go to class , otherwise I would just fall behind and not know what happend .  Personaly , I am not one to really like getting behind , so I think that I made the right decision , granted I may be tired right now , I know my decision to go to class will pay off in the long run .  As my day continued , I went to the actual class lecture for Art history .  It was somewhat interesting , although I found it a little difficult to consentrate .  I guess that may be because I did not catch up on my reading that I was supposed to have completed by today .  Obviously I am paying for the ocnsequenses of not keeping up with the outside responsibilities .  Futhur in the day , I went to the dentist to get a filling , which was not fun !  The right side of my mouth was numb for about 4 hours .  That may not sound like too long , but in reality , when your mouth is numb and you ca n't talk well , and you ca n't eat or drink anything because you will spill it , it is a long time .",0,19,5,0,0,0,0,0,2,6,17,1,6,0,1,26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,12,56,0

I wonder if anyone will actually read this , they must see some weird things when going through all of these .

I 've met people , but I am totally stressed out and I 'm going a bunch of different directions , and I ca n't focus on anybody and I ca n't calm myself down .  veronica is comingf up today or tomorrow for a visit and I wonder how it will be especially since I 've been so stressed out .  I ca n't believe I slept for over nine hours and I do n't feel completely rested .  it totally understand how people pay for caffeine pills here , because this is only the third day of class .  excercise will help relieve my stress I think , so I 'm going to kickboxing in a little while .  the only thing about that is I do n't even know where the damn building is , and I have to run past this strange campus past a million strange people to take a brand new class I 've never been to , and I ; ll probably feel guilty because I have n't even started to stud7y yet .  I know ill be ok but right now I 'm making it very hard for myself to have much fun .  I wonder what I 'll we 'll do tonight ?  I really want a zeta to call me and ask me to go out .  even though its c razy I would have loved to be dragged out of bed and taken out to eat at six in the morning , but no one every came for me , and as far as I know no one ever called for me either .  its a good thing because I needed to work out and sleep like I did and not drink .  its even a Wednesday and they took us out to party hardy , I do n't know how these fgirls can run , because they even look fgood and have boyfriends and make food grades and go out and study and sleep .",0,30,4,0,2,0,0,0,3,21,26,4,10,0,13,72,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,8,107,4

I guess all and all that translates to me being scared of what I am and am not doing .  I sit in my room a lot and think about all the assignments I need to do and all the things I have to do but I never quite get the innitiave to do them until it is the last minute .  I am so scared that I am going to fail now that I am here because I don ; ' t quite think that I belong hwere .  Everyone else seems so smart and like they belong here and I am the black sheep .

I remember setting all of these personal goals for my four glorious years at college , and here I am in week three coming to the not so surprising realization that these goals were totally unrealistic to begin with .  Why do people even set goals ?  Goals lead to expectations , expectations lead to disappointments .  Guatama , one of my personal inspirations founded the great religion of Buddhism .  He came up with the not so clever theory that those who desire nothing are never disappointed with life .  I think most of us had that one figured out in Kindergarten or perhaps I was just exceptionally bright .  As humans we set goals because we find ourselves having nothing to do , and because we fail to accept the fact that we have absolutely no control over our future , which makes man totally uncomfortable .  Our technological advancements were not necessarily for the good of humanity but instead to compensate for our innate fear of nature .  It 's ironic because most Americans have adopted the religion of Christianity , and according to Christianity God created earth and all of its creatures , yet we put absolutely no faith in nature and certainly not in mankind .",0,5,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,4,17,2,2,0,4,14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,36,2

Before I found out I had gotten a scholarship to UT , I had been planning to go to Texas A&M .  Me and Lisa would go to A&M and Lindsey and Lex would go to UT .  Just thinking about splitting up for the first time in our entire lives can still make tears come to my eyes .  NOw I will never know how it would have been .

I quickly checked the caller id and turned off the phone , not wanting to upset my professor .  typically , I 'm told , it 's not good to piss off the professor during the first day of class .  but man , my heart raced after that .

First off with school I am worried about what type of grades I am going to get , whether or not I am going to keep myself on top of my works , whether or not I will have the will power to actually tell people no I ca n't do this because I have to study , how are the first test in all my classes going to go , is there going to be an overwhelming amount of information on my exams that I am going to have to knwo , how much harder are these tests going to be then my test I had in high school , how exactly do I study for a college test when there is so much information to know , how specific are the questions going to be on the test and are they going to be tricky questions .  These are a lot of the questions that run through my head and I am not usually a person who freaks out about stuff in my life .  I guess another reason I am so worried is because I would really like to get into the business school if possible , but everyone tells me how hard it is and that I am going to have to make a 4 .  0 and then even then I possible could not get in if I do n't have the right connections or know the right people .  So on that note , I am starting to try to figure out exactly what am I going to do with my life or major in if I do n't get into the business school .

My parents do n't really have all of that extra money to spend , so I know I 'm going to have to do well this year so that I can earn another scholarship .  Even that does n't stress me out much .

My parents call often , and It 's weird that they miss me so much -- surprising even .  I am outraged that my stupid books cost so much .  I 'm pissed off that everyone here seems to have a boyfriend around , but I do n't .  This girl on my floor always has her boyfriend over , and he brushes his teeth in our water fountain .  Eeeww .

I would love that sensation .  to be bored .  to think , "" hey , I have nothing better to be doing right now than just sitting around .

I had many things to accomplish once I started school here at The university of Texas and I am finally beginning to lighten the stress little by little as I achive the goals I need to .  for instance , today , I needed to petition credit of hours which I earned off of the ap testing which I took in highschool .  I attempted to do it off of my compuiter but for some reason , even though I typed the correct web site , I could not actually claim my hours .  Thus I actually went to the Measures and Evaluations building which allowed me to finally claim and petition my scores .  also , the week before school started , I was ecxperiencing stress due to the fact that the ethernet card I purchased for my computer had a cd which was burned and incompetent of following the demanded preocedures .  at that time , one evening I finally cried because of the accumulated stress which had built up immensly .  thankfully , right now I am a much happier person both on the enterier and teh exterior .  for example , I began to write to all of my friends back home as well as write to my penpal who lives in Cicago Ilinois .

But that is Ok I suppose since I doubt that anyone will ever read this because in a class of 500 students , I do n't think anyone is insane enough to sit down for the time it would take to sort through my terribly confused thoughts .  Confusion is a funny thing .  It comes all at once and for most people it comes quite often .  At least I think it comes quite often since it comes to me quite often .  Even when you know exactly what to do , sometimes you can get confused because you do n't want to do what you are supposed to .  Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet .  ( In a manner of speaking ) I am thinking that I am tired of writing about confusion .  It 's kind of like thinking about thinking .  I heard that it is bad for you to do that .  I think it destroys brain cells .  But then again , a lot of things destroy brain cells .  Drugs destroy brain cells .  I do n't do drugs because I do n't think I have very many brain cells to spare .  Wow , only 5 minutes have passed !  That is terrible because the tips of my fingers are getting sore and I do n't want to stop because you just might have some kind of secret timing mechanism on this little web site of yours and I am taking no chances with that kind of stuff .  I know how sneaky teachers can be .  I know how sneaky students can be .  Some chick was all cheating on out Math Quiz today .  I do n't know who she was , but she was just flipping through her notes .  The teacher had no clue .  He was too busy daydreaming .  I could have cheated also , but I do n't like to cheat .  I think that if my best is n't good enough for the professors at UT , then too bad , I 'll go to community college .  I would rather have a degree from ACC that I earned than one from UT that I cheated my way to getting .  I think most people would agree with me but who knows !  I tend to think that people are good .  But that notion has bitten me in the buttocks more than once .  Take for instance my good friend Tiffany .  Yes , good ol' tiffany .  I loved her to death .  We were really good friends .  We did everything together .  Then one day I found out that she was sleeping with my boyfriend , John .  That was quite a shock to me .  I was so depressed .  I did n't even want to get out of bed .  I did , but it was one of the hardest things I ever had to do .  I was really very in love with him and I thought that he was in love with me too .  I guess that is just one example of how stupid I am .  So I guess I learned from my experience .  People are n't as good as you would want them to be .  But then again maybe I did n't learn jack .  because the next guy I went out with was a jerk too .  Well , he actually was a decent guy .  At least that is what I said to everyone when they told me he was a "" player "" .  Oh gosh I still have 7 more minutes .  Well anyways , they told me he was a player but he said that he thought I was the most beautiful person he had ever met , inside and out .  That was it , I was hooked .  That is all I have ever wanted was for someone to tell me that I was special .  He made me feel pretty and he told me I had the most awesome personality he had ever encountered in a person .",0,40,8,0,3,0,0,0,2,21,41,4,13,0,12,24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,24,142,8

Something just happened , though , so I want to write about that and see where it takes me in the next nineteen minutes or so .  The computer assistant in the theater department ( where I am right now , being a theater major and all ) just complimented me on my hat , a black fedora I bought in Greenwich Village about a year and a half ago .  I was visiting for about a week over spring break and auditioning for the elusive Experimental Theatre wing of NYU 's Tisch School of the Arts .  After a fairly successful audition I concentrated all of my efforts of exploring , something I had done about seven or eight months earlier the first time I visited .  This time I was alone , though .  The time before I had my brother , eighteen months my junior and my closest friend , at my side and all was well .  This time I had to w2ait a couple of days for his arrival , since he could n't get off school and I could , being a senior and having a few excused absence "" college days "" on my hands .  So I set out to explore and found a bar in the mob district of Little Italy that did n't ID and I found myself drunkenly wandering the streets of New York , stumbling upon Strawberry Fields in a haze and not realizing the significance until about a week later .  After three days of being lost in my drugged little haze my brother joined me .  When I picked him up at the airport I noticed that I had taken to thinking of myself as a New Yorker .  I had adopted the city and there was a definite change in the way my brother and I related to each other .  This changed over the next four days , though , as he assimilated into New York the way I had and we set out to Little Italy to begin our evenings with a little pasta , a Nat King Cole impersonator , a jug of white wine every night , and a restaurant owned by the mob .  After taking in as much of the culture and the underbelly of the city we found ourselves down to our last ( having just dropped twenty bucks on some Thai food that smelled like sewer filth ) .

953,"I have decided to get a head start on my writing assignments so here I am writing about my thoughts .  I am completely amazed that I can do this assignment on the internet .  I mean five years ago who ever would have thought that you would be typing and submitting assignments off of the internet .  Sometimes I wonder if the internet is just getting way to big .  I hear people say that they think that it is going to get so big it will just collapse in on itself .  Personally I do not completely understand what they mean by that .  But it is kind of scary that any kid can go on the internet and get as much information about guns and hate groups as they want .  I guess , like most things in life , the internet has its good points and its bad points .  This writing assignment is my first writing assignment in college !  It is so weird that I am now a college student .  I still feel like I do n't completely belong here .  I have met a lot of cool people , but it definately does not feel like home .  For some reason I have not come to realization yet that I am here for like seven more months .  I still have no idea what I want to study .  My major right now is microbiology .  I was planning on becoming a doctor , but I 'm not completely sure .  I think that is what I want to be but I am interested in so many things .  I 'm taking an architecture class this semester just to see if I 'll like that .  I am good at math and science so I considered engineering .  The only problem with engineering is that I really do n't understand what an engineer does !  I love science so I guess the medical field is good for me .  Lately though I have been thinking of studying to become a veternarian .  It involves science and animals and I absolutely love animals .  The problem with deciding on a major is that I have no clue what each major entails .  I guess I will have to go and research all the different majors I have been thinking of .  This past June I went to this program called National Youth Leadership Forum on Medicine in Boston .  I did not really want to go but I decided it would help me to make up my mind on becoming a doctor .  It did not really do that , but it was an interesting experience .  We went to Harvard Medical School and talked to med students there .  That was interesting because I was expecting like a bunch of Einsteins sitting there just naming off different formulas and equations .  Actually they were just normal people who did not seem any different from myself .  Also at the Forum we went on hospital tours and some kids ( I was n't one of the lucky ones ) got to shadow a doctor for a day .  My friend Harris was able to actually watch open heart surgery .  She said she saw the doctors flatline the heart ( I guess the do that in open heart surgery ) and then revive it .  I was angry about that because I really wanted to see something like that .  Instead , the hospital I went to , we had an eighty year old man take us on a hospital tour .

999,"o.  k.  now I have 20 minutes to write whatever I 'm thinking .  Humm .  That 's a lot of time and to be honest I ca n't think of anything to say right now .  I 'm tired and hungry even though I just ate .  Overslept last night so my body is killing me at the moment .  Busted my head playing football yesterday and now my head is killing me .  Glad I did n't have to get stitches cause that would have been bad considering that would cost a lot plus I do n't like stitches .  I do n't like needles at all for some reason .  I want to be a doctor though so that is kind of crazy .  How can you be a doctor if you do n't like stitches .  Well a couple minutes have passed and basically I 'm not sure if I 'm doing this right .  You want me to talk about my feelings huh .  I 'm tired , miss home , and uncomfortable basically .  I feel good right now I guess , I mean I 'm not cold or anything or hot .  Just sitting here without my shirt in a chair .  You told me not to correct my spelling but I missed the r in shirt earlier and spelled shit , and well I do n't want to say just sitting here without my shit , so I corrected it .  I 'm a pretty good typer I guess .  I know where all the keys are and everything and I do n't make too many mistakes .  I 'm using AOL and one of my friends keeps instant messaging me and well I ca n't reply back cause I have to get this done .  I keep putting this assignment off , because I 'm with this fraternity phi-psi and well it takes up a lot of my time and I really do n't have much time to get on the computer and do this .  I could easily have done it on paper cause we have to be at the house for 3 hours everyday for study hours .  The thing is we do n't have computers there and we are supposed to be in this room doing our homework , and well hard to do this assignment when you do n't have a computer handy .  It says to do it in seperate days , but I just finally remembered to do this .  Actually I knew yesterday but the whole day I was at the frat house doing chores to get ready for the big party .  I then went to the big party and had a good time .  I know you 're probably thinking , if you have time to go to the party then you had time to do this .  My answer is true very true , but when you spend 4 hours getting ready for a party you want to enjoy it you know what I mean .",0,25,5,0,0,0,1,0,2,12,78,5,5,0,3,36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,16,135,10
99,"I finally got into this thing .  that took forever .  I hate asking questions so it took even longer .  I think people are always thinking weird things about me , which I know is bad , but I always do .  the good thing is that everyone I 've come in contact here has been really helpful .  I really cant wait for this weekend .  the weeks are so long .  I have n't made any new friends here .  I have a lot friends that came with me from high school to UT and to other schools in San Antonio .  I see them every weekend .  I 'm being really antisocial right now .  the thing is that the friends I have are really close to me , and they know everything there is to know about me , and vice versa .  I spent the last two years of my life with them , it may not seem like a lot but it was two very important years of my life .  I feel really comfortable around them .  I m not good at meeting people so I cant imagine being at the same level of friendship with other people especially in college where everyone just does their own thing .  so I look forward to every weekend .  people around me probably think I 'm weird sitting here just typing continuously .  I 'm sure , actually I 'm almost positive there are weirder people here .",0,23,3,0,0,0,0,0,2,11,33,1,10,0,2,32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,14,84,0
