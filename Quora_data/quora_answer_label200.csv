Sanidhya-Gupta,"TL.DR.This is going to be a long one, And this answer contains what my friends and i have learnt from many years of online shopping.It also talks about some tools which can help you make a decision.This answer manly covers online shopping in India But some general methods can be used all over the world.1. Never Fall for OffersNever Believe what a website has for display as offers that will end soon. Most of the times that product was being sold for the same price for over a month.Here is one such example.We will go with these 4 product that snapdeal was selling in its Super Saver Sundays Clearance saleAnd here are the Price variations of these products over the period of 3-5 months.Borosil Set Of 2 Mixing Bowl With Plastic LidAs you can see there is no special change in the prices of products they put of in the so called sales. And all E-commerce websites are the same be it Flipkart (company), Amazon or snapdeal.So check the normal prices of the products before buying them in an offer.Note - For how i got the Price Charts read further.2. Don't fall for the amount of discount offered. You could be tempted to buy these products seeing the High Discount being offered. Don't be since Most of the times MRP's of product are set optimistically by the people selling them. And the actual worth of the product could be way less.So don't look at the discount they are showing you.The actual Discount is Market Price - Selling Price = DiscountNote - mostly Market price is very less than the MRP.3. Dont Be loyal to a WebsiteAlways search as many e-commerce websites as possible for the same product, and buy from the site which the cheapest since a brand new WD Hard Disk from amazon will be similar to a brand new Hard Disk from FlipkartYou won't get anything for being loyalNote - There are some tools which can help you find the best price faster which are discussed below.4. Don't Randomly Browse for productsNever Randomly browse for products that may interest you, More often than not you will end up buying useless stuff.Always have a target product and range in mind e.g. I wanna buy headphones in the range 1k-3kIf you have a well set goal then it might save you some Bucks.5. Check the past price trendAlways check what has been the past price trend of the product you are about to buy. You might be buying it on the worst possible price and maybe waiting for a week or 2 could get you a better deal.Here is the price chart for Sennheiser HD 800 Wired HeadphonesYup that is a variation of INR 30,000 for a headphones. now imagine buying these headphones in the 2-3 days the price went up? so basically waiting 2-3 days could save you 10-15KNote - How i got the price chart is discussed below.6. Always Read reviewsBuying a bad Product for cheap is worse than buying a great product for a little more. And if people don't like a product they will definitely put a bad review. Reading reviews could save you from buying new stuff again and again.7. Use  PayUMoneyIts a payment Gateway and they give flat off on your final bill on major websites.Eg. they give Flat 5% off on the final bill on Snapdeal,Ibibo,dominos etc.You can register here PayUMoney 8. Use CashBack sitesWhenever you purchase a product always use a cash-back site like CashKaro.com How do they work?STEP 1) Browse their site and choose from 100s of retailers and exclusive offers.STEP 2) Click through to your favourite retailers and shop as usual.STEP 3) The retailer pays them commission for your purchase and they add this as cashback to your earnings. STEP 4) Confirmed Cashback is paid to your Bank Account as real cashYou have to pay the same amount you would on the actual E-commerce site(since the actual billing is done on the E-commerce website you are buying from).CashKaro.com is able to give you cashback because the E-commerce giants pays CashKaro.com for bringing traffic to their website. Sometimes you can save upto 15% by using CashKaro.com.You can sign up here CashKaro.com.There are other CashBack sites too, And you should choose the giving the highest Cashback. Here are a few listed belowwww.pennyful.inTopCashBack.9. Check local Stores tooSome-times local stores sell the same product for cheaper prices. And will get a chance to go and have some fun too.Some Tools that you can use to help in Online shopping.For the people Looking for How to get graphs Read from here Buyhatke's chrome extension can be a real money saver.This extension shows the graph of past prices of Products on all major websites.This is how a web page of an E-commerce website looks after installing the extension Look how it conveniently shows the past prices of a product to help you make a decision on whether to buy it or not.The extension also lets you add this its Watch Price list and it will tell you when the price does down I added a sample product to my watch list  and it shows me what change has occurred in the price since i added it.It also shows you the price of the Product you are looking at on other websites tooThis Extension has saved me and my friends a lot of money.Look for one time signing up OffersIndia is currently a battle field in the e-commerce world and every one is battling out with other to take a bigger market share. To win this War they sometimes shell out stupid 1 time offers that you shouldn't miss.Since it is difficult to find these offers I will list some that i know of(Most of these offers don't require you buy anything or spend anything, but do use these offers now, since they keep changing)Amazon is giving Rs 100 gift card for each new account which signs up using this link Amazon Sign In. Since People started misusing it, Now you are required to buy something worth 300 to get the giftcard, but if were already buying something this giftcard is free.

Sanidhya-Gupta,"Ever heard about majority illusion? It says social behaviors are often contagious, spreading through a population as individuals imitate the decisions and choices of others. I.e. sometimes statistics of polls saying what they think will be the outcome is biased by their social circle irrespective of their opinion.Here is an example to prove that. The following chart represents a network of the entire population of a fictional and very small town. Each circle represents a person. Two people who know each other are connected by a line. People who are not connected by a line have never met.The day’s Poll: whether baseball caps are fashionable. Each circle is colored to indicate that person’s stance on the issue. Blue circles think they are fashionable. Orange circles think they are not. (On this issue, everyone has an opinion.)The town will be voting on whether to officially consider baseball caps fashionable. A polling firm recently asked whether each person thought baseball caps would get a majority of support.Assume each person based their vote solely on how the people they know would vote (excluding his or her own view).Did the polling firm's result be? Do people think it will get a majority or not?Think for a while and try to get to an answerDid you say it will not get a majority Actually, that’s incorrect. Based solely on their friend networks, most people think the measure would pass.Taken at face value, the result seems odd. Only three people think baseball caps are fashionable. But, as shown in these charts, most people think almost everyone else is for baseball caps.The first chart cycles through what the network looks like to each person. Remember, each person only knows about part of the network.The second chart lays out each of these individual views. As you can see, most people think baseball caps are not fashionable (represented by orange circles). But most have a majority of friends who are for baseball caps (blue circles).The majority think they’re in the minority. Or, “the few shaping the opinions of the many,” as network researcher Kristina Lerman described it.Lerman([1506.03022] The Majority Illusion in Social Networks) calls this the “majority illusion.” It’s our flawed perception of some networks that relies a logical proverb: We just don’t know what we don’t know.And in some networks, the information we do have, our sliver of local knowledge, can lead us to the false conclusion.Whether this fictional town endorses baseball caps is rather innocuous. But paradoxes like the majority illusion apply concretely to our world, from the way we fight drug epidemics to how quickly public opinion sometimes flip flops. Understanding the theory behind them gives essential insight into why people form the opinions and make the decisions that they do.In the example above, the people who think baseball caps are fashionable tended to know more people. Networks with this property – those with a correlation between popularity and a specific opinion – are susceptible to the majority illusion, according to Lerman’s research.Earlier research(Page on arxiv.org) into a similar paradox has repeatedly shown statements that seem to contradict themselves are mathematically true: Most of your friends on average have more friends than you, tweet more frequently than you and even drink more alcohol than you.This quirk is caused by a diverse network with ultra-popular hubs. The @justinbieber’s of the world skew the results for the rest of us. (Math nerds: Lerman’s research group has shown(Page on arxiv.org) this holds in some networks even when taking medians, not means.) This conundrum, called the “friendship paradox,” is closely related to the majority illusion.This illusion may have been behind the swift change in public opinion on the issue of same-sex marriageRepublican pollster Glen Bolger told The Fix’s Chris Cillizza in June he thought the opinion change happened at the interpersonal level.“I think the shift is because as more and more gays came out of the closet, people realized they know gays personally, and that makes a huge difference in attitudes,” Bolger said.This personal persuasion effect is well-known. But Lerman’s research pushes it further, examining how different configurations of networks can catalyze such a change of opinion.A person with a large audience spreads his or her opinions much more widely than the average person does. By definition, he or she has many more connections, which means more people are on the receiving end of the opinion. This gives a celebrity’s opinion outsize influence, affecting the local perspectives of many.If same-sex marriage proponents tend to be more popular in a network, then, by the same logic, their opinion would seem more prevalent than it actually isSince people base their decisions on the behaviors of others, as Lerman’s research notes, this can cause mass changes in opinion over time.Polling is an effective antidote to the majority illusion. If people have an accurate sense of where an entire population stands on an issue, the influence of a biased local network is lessened. One may not personally know any Republicans who would vote for Donald Trump, for instance, but polling shows many would.But not all issues have as much polling as presidential races – or any polling at all. And without that global knowledge, the majority illusion can be a factor.Lerman suspects the majority illusion and related paradoxes were factors in the same-sex marriage opinion shift, noting the change was likely well underway before pollsters started providing global knowledge.[What’s across the ocean from you when you’re at the beach, in 7 fascinating maps]The applications of these discoveries are subject only to imagination. Lerman floated these ideas as potential research areas:Fighting HIV in Africa: Instead of vaccinating a random group of people, vaccinate their friends. The “friendship paradox” states their friends will most likely have more friends and are therefore more center to the overall network.The role of mass media: Lerman thinks the Arab Spring movement gained traction at least partially because mass media, by definition, is a “hub” in many networks. By covering demonstrations, the many people connected to media organizations saw others demonstrating and joined in themselves.Alcohol abuse on college campuses: Since the “friendship paradox” holds that on average your friends drink more than you do, raising awareness of this quirk could give understanding to those who feel pressured to increase their own drinking.SourcesPage on arxiv.orgPage on arxiv.org[1506.03022] The Majority Illusion in Social NetworksA quick puzzle to tell whether you know what people are thinking",mid,mid,high,mid,mid
Sanidhya-Gupta,"Mood Indigo, IIT Bombay, popularly known as MoodI or MI, is the annual cultural festival of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB). It is a four-day long event held towards the end of December every year. Its last edition witnessed a footfall of more than 88,000 students from more than 700 colleges from across the country. Started in 1971 by a bunch of enthusiastic IITians, Mood Indigo,[2] now in its 43rd edition, has snowballed to become the largest festival of its kind in AsiaHere are some questions whose answers may interest youWhat are some interesting behind-the-scenes stories about Mood Indigo?Why is Mood Indigo of IIT Mumbai a popular cultural festival in India?What are some of the best images of cultural festivals of IITs like Mood Indigo and Rendezvous?Techfest, IIT Bombay is the annual science and technology festival of Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB) It also refers to the independent body of students who organize this event along with many other social initiatives and outreach programs round the year. Started in 1998 with the aim of providing a platform for the Indian student community to develop and showcase their technical prowess, it has now grown into the largest college technical festival in all of Asia. It is among the very few student organisations to have received patronage from UNESCO for promotion of technical know-how as well as taking up social causes through ideate competitions and other initiatives over the years.The activities culminate in a grand three day festival event in the month of January within the campus of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay which attracts over 100,000 from all over India and even abroad, including students, academia, corporates and the general public (30,000 from India)P.S. my point of view is restricted to IITB :(",mid,mid,high,mid,mid
Sanidhya-Gupta,"Direct Connect(DC) allows you to share files over the Lan/network without restrictions or limits. The client is completely free of advertisements and has a nice, easy to use interface. Firewall and router support is integrated and it is easy and convenient to use functionality like multi-hub connections, auto-connections and resuming of downloads.Some features that make the students of IIT's use dcIn none of the IIT's that i have ever been to has torrent enabled on its network or they need some other medium to get their movies,soaps and stuff they need do quench their never decreasing thrust ;)Shares large files,Got a large file and dont have a pen-drive or a hard-disc no worries DC++ is here to helpIts so much better than torrents for a closed network community like IIT, as in torrents you need to have a separate search directory like pirate bay,kickasstorents etc to keep a list of all torrents and in a changing community(people come and do every time) like IIT its almost impossible to do so. Here DC comes to help since you simple search the file name you want directly from the software then it goes looking for that file in the shared folders of every person connected. if there is a match you start downloading :)Auto- share function helps keep it simple since when you get a new file you dont need to go and make a torrent and share the torrent file with everyone, DC simply can autoshare the file all you need to is have the file in your shared folderWorks with duplicate names too, in torrents if 2 people share the same file with different names you will have to chose 1 and hence you will lose out on seed(places to download) hence reducing your speed, but DC uses something known as TTH so a same file will have the same TTH irrespective of its name. This way you get to download from loads of people at ones thus higher speeds :)It even has a chat of its own, i know for sure IIT kharagpur uses the DC chat alot, considering its so isolated from any decent human civilization :P, so its a good time-pass for themDC tends to utilize all the network speed, which is good because this way you get awesome speeds since all computers are interconnected via the awesome network so the speed is not limited by the internet speedHas it ever happened to that you are downloading a file and it stops at 99% and the download fails? this is eliminated in DC, so better downloads :)I might add more if i remember them And DC++ is just a client which uses DC protocol and there are many more like it namely strong DC++, apex DC++ etc :)here is some info about it Direct Connect (protocol)",mid,mid,high,mid,mid

Sanidhya-Gupta,"Most laptops today use lithium Ion (Li-ion) batteries. Overcharging Li-ion batteries is not a problem and does not affect the battery life span. These batteries can be charged 300 to 500 times, and they have an internal circuit to stop the charging process at full charge. The control system prevents overcharging, which can cause the lithium ion battery to overheat and potentially burn. This is why the Li-ion batteries are more expensive. The only way for the Li-ion battery to overcharge is if the charging system malfunctions, and then the battery will heat up while in the charger. If you don't plan to use your laptop for long period of time, you can extend the life of your lithium ion laptop battery by storing it with a 50 percent charge. A fully discharged battery left for a long period of time will lose its charging capacity. Fully charged batteries discharge when they are left unused, and will lose effectiveness. This is why it is recommended to discharge a Li-ion battery until it is almost out before shutting down. Running a Li-ion battery down completely will diminish capacity. Keep the battery in a cool place and do not store your computer for a long period of time while it is fully charged.Older laptops use Nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) and Nickel Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) batteries. They require more maintenance than Lithium Ion batteries. They must be fully discharged and then fully recharged so that they don't lose battery life. These batteries can be overcharged only if they go through too many cycles of charging and discharging, which reduces their effectiveness and capacity. It is better to charge all batteries fully before use; then use on battery power until the optimum level for each battery type is reached, before recharging.",mid,mid,high,mid,mid
Sanidhya-Gupta,"The Best notes are ones you make while learning something notes by FIITJEE/bansal are more like books than notes. here are some good tips to help you make better notesOrganize yourself prior to your class.  make sure to bring everything that you will need to be a good listener and an efficient note-taker. If course has an outline of the term keep it always with you throughout the year. This will help you to go ahead to see what the next topic or lesson is. Don’t forget ample paper, writing utensils and, if necessary, eyeglasses and/or hearing aids. Always have a backup pen or pencil, preferably two or three.Use highlighters. It is important to highlight important points for later revision. You don't need a full set of colors, two should be enough, one for main points and the other for sub points or interesting facts.Think about what you want to retain. Why are you taking the class? While it may be your first instinct to try and write down what you hear or see verbatim, you have to remember that you are taking notes, not writing a novel.Focus on recording information that is new to you. As tempting as it might be, taking notes about stuff you already know doesn't end up helping much in the end.Create a system of note-taking that allows you to write quickly and get down basic concepts, but which will also allow you to quickly find information in your notes later. Consider using an outline format, for example, or clearly separating your notes into different sections (or columns if you are using a steno pad or a computer). Consider learning or creating your own shorthand to help take notes a little faster.Highlight key words and phrases. Make the important things stand out. If the speaker emphasizes a certain concept, make sure to do the same in your notes.Utilize meaningful symbols. Symbols like arrows, dots, boxes, diagrams, charts, and other visual notes are often great ways to associate and remember key concepts.Write your notes for the future. When you are in the situation, recognize that you will have to return to the notes later and understand your notes. If you have time, review your notes as the speaker communicates familiar material. Otherwise, go back and review them immediately after the lecture, when the topics are fresh in your mind.And Best of luck :)",mid,mid,high,mid,mid
Sanidhya-Gupta,"Make things interesting. Logical arguments will not give you motivation to study. Thinking that if I study hard and get into a good university and get a good job, etc., will not interest you. Love what you do. Try to find the beauty of every subject, and most importantly try to link it with the events of your life and things that interest you.This linking may be conscious (i.e. performing chemical reactions, physical experiments or manual mathematics calculations in order to prove a formula) or unconscious (eg. You go to the park and look at the leaves. Then you think to yourself, Hmm, let me review the parts of the leaf we learned in bio class last week). Even though this might not sound the most ideal method for theoretical subjects such as English, use your creativity to make stuff up. For example try to write a story with all subjects starting with S, all objects starting with O, and no verbs containing V.Manage your time. Make a weekly schedule and devote a certain amount of time per day to studying. This will also improve your grades. That amount will vary depending on whether you're in high school or college, and also varies by field of study.Study in 20-50 minute chunks. It takes time for your brain to form new long-term memories, and you can't just keep studying flat out. Take 5-10 minute breaks minimum and do something physically active to get your blood flowing and make you more alert. Do a few jumping jacks, run around your house, play with the dog, whatever it takes. Do just enough to get yourself pumped, but not worn out.Make enough time in your schedule to get enough sleep. Think of it this way: If you sleep only 4-5 hours, you'll probably need to double your study time in order to be as effective as if you'd gotten 7-9 hours of sleep. Study more and sleep less? That doesn't sound like a very good deal. Get a good night's sleep every night and you'll be making the best of your study time. If you end up a little sleep deprived despite your best efforts, take a short nap (20 minutes) before studying. Then do some physical activity (like you would do during a break) right before you start.Work harder on your assignments, study for tests, take any extra credit opportunities, and be sure to hand everything in on time. Do this regardless of what a teacher says your chances are. Also, participate more in class.Find a good study spot. You should feel comfortable, but not so comfortable that you risk falling asleep--a bed isn't a very good study spot when you're tired! The place where you study should be relatively quiet (traffic outside your window and quiet library conversations are fine, but interrupting siblings and music blasting in the next room are not).As far as music is concerned, that's up to you. Some people prefer silence, others prefer music in the background. If you belong to the latter group, stick to instrumental music (music that has no words like classical, soundtrack, trance, baroque ) and that you're already familiar with (not something that's bound to distract you)--otherwise, your brain will ""multi-task"" and not be able to retain information as well.Having the television on while you study is generally a bad idea. It can distract you a lot and suck all of the things you've studied out by making you focused on the show that is on.Prioritize. You'll need time and dedication to get those scores up. Quit procrastinating and do the work.Talk to your professors/TA about your grade. Ask if there is anything missing, or anything else you can do to improve it.Obtain extra credit. This goes for regular assignments as well. If you must write at least eight sentenced paragraphs, try writing 9 or 10. If you can add color to an assignment, (this often goes for science assignments) do so! Some teachers will give you at least one point extra credit.Learn the most important facts first. Don't just read the material from beginning to end, stopping to memorize each new fact as you come to it. New information is acquired much more easily when you can relate it to material that you already know.sources - How to StudyHow to Improve Your Grades",mid,mid,high,mid,mid

NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS- The number of attempts which a candidate can avail at JEE (Main) shall be limited to 03 (three).Do read the JEEadvanced manual too(I didn't feel like reading it)Manage timeNow if you are eligible for JEE 2015 on these grounds you will now have to start making a game plan.Assuming you are currently doing a job or are studying in some other Engineering college, you will have to make a timetable which is very well defined till next JEEI would also suggest joining a Coaching center this will surely help and will give a good boostDon't listen to what the society has to sayAll you should care for is what you want and what you can achieve and not what the society thinks you can achieve.Strengthen your basic conceptsYou have an added advantage of experience over others all you need is a solid base ground to make it all work in your favorGive it your best shotDon't let the future you say ""I could have done better, if i had worked just a bit more harder"", you have got a chance make it countYou will not be let alone here in IIT since there are always elder people here too, I have a person in my batch who i think is atleast 24 years old (he has a lot of backlogs).

Sanidhya-Gupta,"Not a lot of people in my life know this but here it goes.It was a nice weekend night in mids of october 2008 i guess the date was 11th, my brother was home on vacations from college and i had a cousin sister visiting us too since she had to do some shopping for her marriage. It was late at night about 11-12 pm i was playing counter strike(since i had to practice as my brother killed me all the time and a lot of times with knife :P)  and my brother was watching the TV. When suddenly we heard a loud weird sound and it was a continuous too, first we thought the TV is making it, we switched it off with no effect, then we switched the fan off with still no effect then we thought it was coming from outside and we went in the balcony, and there is a petrol pump just below our building, and they were filling the natural gas tank so they had this big tanker standing there but what was weird is there was a strange wind sort of thing coming out of the big tanker and a man was struggling with some red colored apparatus with no effect some thing like the man below but not as joyful.Then my brother rushed me in the house, i was like why should i, i wanted to watch this first hand. But luckily he was stronger and pushed me in. When we went in he locked the door and we went off to wake our parents while we at it we heard a loud sound(something like what a cloud makes but after these many years i am not sure anymore) and every thing went yellow orangish. Our house is open from 2 sides with windows all around and there is no construction with big heights on my side of the flat(apartment) so it pretty open. And in no time we knew it was fire, and we had to evacuate.Here is a google map image of the situation here is the legend red - our apartmentyellow - the balconyblue - approx location of the tankblack - location of the underground tankgreen - the pipe which connects to the underground tankhere is a link to google maps locationGoogle MapsBy now my cousin didi(sister) and my parents were awake and in the drawing room and i picked up the phone to inform the authorities, i dialed a number but couldn't connect to anyone i dialed it again still nothing so my parents told me leave and run, so we left the apartment without even our slippers.(the number i was dialing was 911 (call id thing told me) since i watch a lot of hollywood movies the number is in my mind for any emergencies, we need to learn from this :P) The main exit for our apartment is facing the petrol pump, but thanx to the designer of the building there is a back exit which connects building 1 and 2 so we escaped using that and came out of the gate between building 2 and 3, a lot of people were there, for now the fire was like a blow torch coming out of the earth but didnt look like it could do us any harm this far and nothing much seemed to be damaged(this was 2-3 mins from the first fire). The flames were higher than our building thoughWe were all happy that no one was injured , Just then we heard large bang, the previous one was nothing compared to this one, the blast was a kind you just want to run away from, thats what everyone started to do and we could see some burning pieces flying in the direction we were running, the speed it was flying with gave it a feel like it must be light weight. After the bang the entire area lit up again, this time the lighting was continuous, it made a loud continuous sound too.then a man came running towards us from the petrol pump side, he was chared blank and he smelled really funny and his hair seemed like and afro hair-do. The people got him a chair to sit, but some one suggested we should take him to an ambulance, by this time fire brigade and the authorities were here with a swift response time of less than 10 mins, we have a fire station less than 2-3 km from our home that might have helped :). but the problem was the only road out of our society was the one adjacent to the petrol pump.the red is the main road out. the light green part was still forest like back then and the blue path was our only way out, but they were thorny bushes and we were bare foot. we had to take the burnt person to an ambulance and surely ambulance couldn't come to us, and the man now couldn't even stand up from the chair. so 4 people picked up the chair and started to take him out the blue way, some people volunteered to give their slippers and we were thankful, i tagged along the burnt person to help them carry him(wasn't much help though).after we dropped him off to an ambulance we headed back since we had my mom and did back there and we couldn't leave them alone.By now the area was filled with people and fire men and police were trying to control them. They pouring water from far away since the flames were very high, later we got to know that the the blow torch type of fire was coming out of the underground tank and the fire authorities just didnt want it to spread and wanted to wait out for the gas in the tank to finish.Now we got to examine the burnt flying pieces we saw while running, They were actually structures of steel each weighing about 20-50 Kg and the speed they were travelling with if they would have crossed path with any human s/he was dead for sure.What we still didn't know was where those structures came from, i don't recall seeing those structures at the petrol pump. Later we got to know that the first fire was in the gas that had already escaped. The Big Boom was that of the tanker which came for filling and when it blew up it went thru the petrol pump roof making a big hole in it, that is where the steel structures came from, the tanker had lost most of its energy while going thru the steel roof of the petrol pump still it manged to go far away but still land safely it could have gone anywhere and killed people with it, or damaged buildings but it chose to take the safer route and flying steel damaged some cars but nothing serious. The pic below explains the path of the tanker the red is the path it took and cluster is where it broke the roof thruthe green the path, thanx to god it didn't take and the blue is where i was.here is a snap of a video of the event and here is the video of the event with the tanker blastother videosactual image but it was way later The after math 1) The person i was initially, they only recovered his bones, i believe i was the last person to see him2) The burnt person died at the hospital3) Some people who lived in front of the petrol pump got some 2nd degree burns since they had no other exit but they all survived.4) In all only 3 people died and of those two were incharge of the tanker.5) luck was in our favor we could move back in out homes at about 2 PM next day but we took a shower and went off to live at our relatives for a day or two.here is a news article 3 killed in petrol pump fire - The Times of IndiaAnd there was no welding at the petrol pumpNo major property loss took place except to the petrol pump.I survived, the petrol pump opened a year or so later with out the CNG gas extension. and without a roof :PThis is my biggest answer till date :)Thanx for reading",mid,mid,high,mid,mid

Gymkhana General Elections 2013 ResultsKeeping us not informed about who won and with what votes is like telling us 'You have given your vote now forget it'FACT 2 -> From what i have heard the vote penalties range upto 350+(correct me if i am wrong as no official statement was made i dont have a good enough source) for a UG post (EDIT penalties range upto 720 and in some cases the number of votes of the winner is less than the penalty of the opponent) compare that to max 20 penalty last yearCompare that to the number of UG votes casted for that post just last year which comes out to be 3495. now 350 is 10%(EDIT - its 20% penalty this year) of that amount now if you take that away from some1's vote count how do expect his to win if there are 4 candidates so its like the person will have to get way more than other candidates to win. Some one rightly said ""A group of people conducted a witch-hunt and imposed a penalty so frivolous and so large that they should rather have had the guts to disqualify my candidature""FACT 3 -> The reason for penalties is not provided to the general public.For a general person it is equivalent to the election council giving out penalties to every one till their desired candidate won!!EDIT - FACT 4 -> 2 Candidates lost just because of the penalties imposed on them. Reasons for which as still nowhere to be seen.So do i call the elections Democratic HELL NO!!. it not a democracy where some people have a very crucial decision making power and they may decide who wins and who dosent.

Sanidhya-Gupta,"You dont store ""current"" in a battery :PElectricity, as you probably already know, is the flow of electrons through a conductive path like a wire. This path is called a circuit.Batteries have three parts, an anode (-), a cathode (+), and the electrolyte. The cathode and anode (the positive and negative sides at either end of a traditional battery) are hooked up to an electrical circuitThe chemical reactions in the battery causes a build up of electrons at the anode. This results in an electrical difference between the anode and the cathode. You can think of this difference as an unstable build-up of the electrons. The electrons wants to rearrange themselves to get rid of this difference. But they do this in a certain way. Electrons repel each other and try to go to a place with fewer electrons.In a battery, the only place to go is to the cathode. But, the electrolyte keeps the electrons from going straight from the anode to the cathode within the battery. When the circuit is closed (a wire connects the cathode and the anode) the electrons will be able to get to the cathode. In the picture above, the electrons go through the wire, lighting the light bulb along the way. This is one way of describing how electrical potential causes electrons to flow through the circuit.However, these electrochemical processes change the chemicals in anode and cathode to make them stop supplying electrons. So there is a limited amount of power available in a battery.When you recharge a battery, you change the direction of the flow of electrons using another power source, such as solar panels. The electrochemical processes happen in reverse, and the anode and cathode are restored to their original state and can again provide full power.",mid,mid,high,mid,mid
Sanidhya-Gupta,"I believe that for the given number 43186 the output should be 43618.I will be not be giving the exact code but just telling you how to do it.And i wont be giving the fastest way, but the easiest way.First make an array of each digit of the number.(you can get the last digit of any number by A%10 where A is the number whose last digit you need, and to remove the last digit simply A = A/10 here A need to be an int)then move right to leftand try to find a digit larger than the current digit and that digit should lie to the right of the current digit.lets do it for your example 43186after dividing it into an array we will get this (i have revered the digits here but you can do what you like )6 8 1 3 4now i first digit is 6 but there is no digit larger than 6 towards the left(since i have revered the number ) of 6  so we move to the next number.which is 8, now there is only 6 towards the left of 8 and it is not larger than 8, so we move to to the next digit.which is 1, now we have 8 and 6 towards the left of 1 and since both are larger than 1 we will choose the smallest of the numbers which are larger than 1, which come to be 6, now we replace 1 and 6 so our array becomes1 8 6 3 4now we will arrange all number before 6 in descending order which will make it8 1 6 3 4 now reverse the digits and print them to get43618 which is the desired number :)",mid,mid,high,mid,mid
Sanidhya-Gupta,"I will share my Personal Branch experience which is Mech @ Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB) batch of '16 First i will answer in terms of courseswhen we joined IITB we were alloted our rooms according to our jee rank(no advanced in our times) and the allotment was such that higher rank people went to H1,then H2 then H3 and then H4 so most of the people who occupied reserved seats were in H4 with some people in H3(i am in H3 and i came in a GEN seat) H1,H2,H3 and H4 are just hostels @ IITBNow the general trend is H1 - > many of them changed their branch and went into CS or elec which implies higher CPI, and those who didnt still had a good CPIH2 - > We (the H3 junta) when talking about lab partners used to say things like "" yaar tera to chill hai tera partner to H2 ka hai"" which implies these people are also the people with higher CPI. H3 -> then comes the h3 junta most of who are good CPI people and some(1-2) are very good CPI people but we also have people who failed in a few courses like my rommie. so we have mixed CPI people hereH4 -> most of the FR(fail) grades are given to people here there are a few good CPI people too, but the trend in more people fail here than any other hostelI am in no ways saying they are dumb but the JEE rank is a good parameter to check how hard a person is willing to work(not the best and not always right) and since the grading is relative(i.e. if all your classmates get 100/100 and you get 99/100 you still get the least possible passing grade that is DD and there is always someone who has to be below average so that comes out to be people with lower AIR in jeeBut there are students from reserved category that out perform others. well its bcoz of a student from reserved category that i pass my courses, if he dosent teach me i would very easily fail.I will add the extra-curricular part soon but if i forget Plz leave a msg.i will give a brief thoughSince the extra-curricular have nothing to do with AIR so people with reserved category dont struggle there.

Sanidhya-Gupta,"you are talking about the 2nd type of vectors here.for those who dont know what am talking about read comments on this answer Sanidhya Gupta's answer to A vector has a magnitude and a specific direction. Suppose you have vector a⃗ that starts at point (0,0) and ends at (1,1). Relative to what does the vector have direction ? its just a way i used to explain the author of the questionNow in this vector we define it such that the starting point is (0,0) which is just like you on a map where you consider yourself always at (0,0)Now lets imagine we were playing a treasure hunt and some1 was giving us directions to go to our treasure. and he/she is giving them in the form or vectors which are A(-1,2) and B(3,1). so to reach your treasure you have to just go do A first then B or you could do B first then A. you can also say you have to do A+B. so simply go to A then think(just think) of it as you new origin and execute B and you will get to the treasure, lets say c which is (2,3).read this will be helpful :)SparkNotes: Vector Addition: The Graphical Method for Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplicationand if you get in trouble with vector subtraction consider A-B as A+(-B)",mid,mid,high,mid,mid

RSA relies on the assumption that it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on the fact that there are efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to be a hard problem.In short if you can see a very large number and quickly tell what its prime factors are then you will be a very rich man/woman :).You can read more about it here Public-key cryptography",mid,mid,high,mid,mid
Sanidhya-Gupta,"You should always follow your heart even if you regret it in the future. Because there is no regret bigger that the regret of not doing what you liked.You are not alone, I know a lot of people (more than a lot actually) who quit very high paying jobs just because they were not happy with what they were doing and they wanted to follow their dreamsAnd it's never too late to quit what you are doing and start something new. For instance my dad gave up the family business when he was over 40 years old and then he got his MBA and started teaching financial management to college students. And I believe that he believes that it was the best decision of his life. And don't take it for granted that you would in the future still like teaching. Just follow yours dreams and do what you love or love what you do. Its better to be happy knowing you gave your dreams a fair shot rather than being sad for what you didn't do.Just imagine how well our society will do if everyone did what they liked and not what the society wanted them to do. We would have engineers who will actually like building stuff and not someone who won a rat race, we will have scientists who actually like discovering new things rather than people who didn't win the eat race, we would have painters who are actually passionate about what they do rather than people who didn't get into engineering or commerce, we would have teachers who actually want the students to learn rather than rote the syllabus. That in my opinion is the ideal society and the only way everyone can be truly happy.I know what you are going through. And don't worry you have nothing to worry about and I would suggest you should be happy that you made that decision, it is definitely better than realizing that you don't want to be doing what you were doing a year down the road. Now that you have another thing checked out of what you want to do with life you have a happier life ahead.I too have faced similar decisions but definitely never as crucial as yours and i am happy with the choices i made, even if they would have turned out big failures :PI hope you find out what you want to do with your life as soon as possible :)And you are not a quitter :P",mid,mid,high,mid,mid

Sanidhya-Gupta,"It is not a matter of odd or even its all simple electronics. Each battery has a voltage rating and for the kind of battery you are talking it's 1.5V per battery and more often than not you need more than 1.5V to run a circuit since its too less voltage so you make a kind of circuit which adds up the voltages and it is called a series circuit. So by putting 2 1.5V batteries you get total 3V which can run a RC(your TV remote) circuit. So mostly its 2 batteries you simply don't need to add the third.But someone might make a circuit which requires 4.5V to operate and then you will need 3*1.5V batteries. And since you haven't found it yet means you haven't looked well yet.And to simmer your hunger for an odd battery device you can make your own 3 battery device. All you need is 3*1.5 batteries, some connecting wires and a 5V motor. Now connect the batteries in series, if you don't know what it means than simply Google it. Then connect the 5v motor in series with the batteries and close the circuit. Now you will have a 3 battery device, which has A rotating motor.

But,having seen a lot of life, the  perceptions are completely different now.Be someone who listens to everyone on the table. Don't be an asshole.Stop giving a fuck to your critics. There will always be a set of people who will speak against you/criticize you/be jealous of you. Stop caring about them and doubting your capabilities. When people make anonymous accounts just to criticize you,You've got balls of steel.Talent isn't enough to achieve your goals.You need to put in that extra mile of effort.Try out different options before settling. It's your life we are speaking about. There are people better than you in every field. Accept it !Don't compare yourself with others. Seriously. Everyone is battling their own set of hurdles in life. Discuss ideas not people. Worrying hasn't got you anything yet and it will definitely not get you anything in the future as well If you are contributing to something and others aren't responsible . Stop complaining that it's not your job. Get out and do their job as well if you are really concerned about the thing you're working on. I had been in this stage and I used to complain initially but later , when I learnt this, I stopped giving a damn.Thinking about big ideas is awesome but you need to put on hard work to implement them as well.

While,we IIT'ians were burning the midnight oil for IIT-JEE,those students  were on TopCoder and Codeforces and participating in IOI. As you can see from the above graph,in the 1st year 70 % of the students learn the basics of programming. Competitive coding is in general  started around second year after Algorithms course. There are very few teams that dedicatedly prepare for ICPC ( the number depends on peer pressure and varies from college to college. IIIT Hyderabad ranking 1 in terms of the most experienced coders of the country ) and the enthusiasm is negligible in the final year as all of us have got jobs. COURSE STRUCTURE : The course structure of Computer Science is very heavy in the IIT's. On an average we have 3 labs and 5 courses per semester leaving us very less time. Few give up on academics on focus on competitive programming. Few give up on everything and focus on extra academic activities. The course is designed in such a way that you need to start competitive programming in your first year itself and keep practicing in the vacations and then you'll be in a position to manage Academics and ICPC Preparation. I have seen the best coders screwing up their academics. Also, I have seen the best coders who are the department toppers.DEVELOPMENT/RESEARCH : In a survey I found out that few of my friends preferred a development side project/open source contribution/research project/app development than Competitive programming. This might be another reason that few of the sharp brains aren't investing their time on Competitive programming. Considering the above four points,I think the students have an edge to Indians mainly because they start early . Students work extremely hard to get into IIT. If Computer Science was a compulsory course in 11th and 12th for IIT-JEE,the subject of the question would be - Why aren't coders from outside as good as Indians ? )",high,high,high,mid,low

Yash-Bajaj-1,"Unlike other IIT's we don't have much to do outside the campus. It's  an underdeveloped place outside. Other than a couple of restaurants and dhabas we have nothing much. Our life is restricted in the incredibly large heaven.Load and Peace : Oh these words mean so much to us ! Peace maar yaar , Load kyu le raha hai ! Basically Load is used colloquially as a reference to any problem you are facing and peace is used as a substitute to chill off. These words have a significant impact on your family as well. Load and Peace are officially accepted in my home. The hall day saga : In the month of march,every hall has it's hall day. That's the day when you call all of your friends to your room and serve them food,have long bhaat sessions (bhaat = gossip) . They write stuff about you on your room walls. They will destroy your room. Throw shampoos/detergent/eggs et all here and there . Destroy your cupboards/beds . In my first year,I left the room for 5 mins on my hall day and I did not find my clothes in the cupboard.Reason being they were hanging from the fans . However,I like the social part of the hall day and strict disciplinary action is being taken these days for destroying hall properties. So,beware!General Championships : Every hall competes the whole year for three championships namely Tech , Sports and Social and Cultural.  Each of these genres have multiple competitions spread out the year. Every competition has points to win for.The points are cumulatively added for every hall and at the end of the year the hall that wins the GC collects the trophies. Believe me,the happiness of going on stage for a competition with your friends is totally worth it !Society culture : Here comes my favourite portion of Kgp life. Other IITs also have this society culture but it is very extensive in IIT Kharagpur because that's the only resort for enthusiasts. We have societies with interests ranging from robotics to dramatics,entrepreneurship cells,business clubs,coding clubs,AIESEC,Spats etc. Name a keyword and there's a society ready for you . The bonding that you make with your society seniors/juniors is inexpressible. You get to learn a lot of things from seniors and like Kyuki saas bhi kabhi bahu thi you'll do the same for the generation. Oh,I so miss the treats ! Illumination and Rangoli : How do you people spend your Diwali ? Bursting crackers eh ? No,we have a different way of celebrating it. Every hall raises up patterns of diyas made up on a chatai which require minimum 20 days of effort by the students for  mere 5 minutes on the Diwali night. Also, high class Rangolis are made by every hall .They are judged by the professors and the hall that wins gets a matka of Rasogullas and immense fame inside the campus.Politics : So,there's this student body in the Gymkhana where few students are nominated for the posts of Vice President,General Secretaries etc . Every hall presents few of their students with excellent academic ,extra academic & leadership skills. The halls are divided into pacts.There is endless campaigning during the hall days. There are fights between pacts (Verbal,mostly over the internet). Baseless allegations over the internet against the opponents. Pretty good scene down here ! There is a final open air question session for the candidates before the elections where they put forth their proposals and are grilled by a panel of students with excellent caliber.Cosplay : Like all the IITs,we have official photoshoots with our batchmates and professors in suits and boots but what we do have apart from it is the Cosplay.This is on the last exam of your final semester where you dress up as a character and give your final exam. The happiness level that day was over 9000.2.2 : I think this is the trademark of IIT Kharagpur. So,2.2 is basically a path inside the campus which covers almost all the campus and is roughly 2.2 kms odd . A serene walk down this beautiful path is very pleasant. Also,it's the best place to have long bhaat sessions with your best friends / girlfriend / boyfriend .The beautiful photos are the work of the students namely Siddharth Agarwal ,Nikesh Aryan and Mayank Choudhury,the most talented photographers of the institute.

It's highly misleading for the JEE aspirants . All they see is the big fat figures and join a random branch in an IIT and then curse the system for four years of their life. I've seen many people giving up right at the start ,few give up eventually. Institutes should do something about this. This is sad.FYI,Statistics say that a 100K $ salary for a company in Silicon Valley,an Indian saves about 20K $ which is roughly 12.36 Lakhs. For the same profile in India,you earn about 11-12 Lakhs,On an average, 7-8 lakhs is saved. You see,there's not much difference. So,my request to Indian media,please share the information in depth.Half information is always misleading.The base is 100K$,there are additional joining bonuses and stocks which are distributed in 4/5 years.

Here are few things which I'd like to point out :People who regularly asked for help from my dad,the ones who took advice from my dad in every step never came to ask my mom about our family after the incident. I felt very sad because my dad had done so much for them and in return we didn't even get a call . I came to know about such kind of two faced people and that you should stop expectations from such people. There were times where there were at few rituals etc where widows aren't allowed . That was sad for my mom. I don't know what kind of stupid beliefs people follow.I mean,firstly the person is in pain and you make them realize that they are in pain by doing such things. Seriously ?

My dad had planned his life so well in terms of insurances and policies and he had sacrificed so much in his life that we have been living a good life for more than 7 years despite being from a middle class family. I started earning. I feel that it'd be awesome that I would tell my dad to stop working and chill out and eat at all the places where we checked our pockets before entering and go to all the places where we thought of but could not. But sad that i cannot do that.Any decision we make,we have to think a lot.But you know what my mom and my brother never let me feel that we lack something.

Yash-Bajaj-1,"Google's Page Rank Algorithm is pretty cool. It uses the concept of random walks in a Directed Acyclic Graphs. I'll be very crisp and out of math in the answer. You can view the wiki for the math. Consider all the webpages in the world as nodes of a graph. All the hyperlinks i.e mentions of a website on another website as the edges. For ex : I'll add a hyperlink to google on my personal webpage then it'll result in an edge from my webpage to google. So,in this way the graph is made.Now,page rank basically ranks the webpages . So,a generic score needs to be assigned to every webpage upon which they'll be ranked. This score is dependant on the webpages that point it with a factor of alpha and a constant term with a factor of beta. The computations are made and the scores are computed till no further change in scores can be obtained. From the above image the percentage indicates the scores/pagerank of the nodes. We can observe that even though C has lesser links it has a pretty high score because it is being pointed by a popular node .So,B shares some of it's score with C giving rise to such high values. I've used a word called Random walk. If I am surfing a page and there are two hyperlinks from that page and I have to randomly chose one of them then there is 50 % probability of choosing a page. It is said that if you randomly keep surfing the webpages by clicking hyperlinks from a page then you'll eventually end up on a page with a high pagerank. With a probability of alpha perform random walk to one of it's neighbours and with probablity beta restart the surfing from some other page. Google uses beta =1 and alpha = 0.85 for calculations.  Now,you know what to do to increase the page rank of your webpage -",high,high,high,mid,low

Yash-Bajaj-1,"Here's a very old article from India today :Not a day passes without news of a spat between Bangalore and  Hyderabad, two of the most cosmopolitan Indian cities of roughly the  same size. Actually, Bangalore has already arrived. A few years  ago, the Japanese management guru Kenichi Ohmae wrote that Bangalore was  India's future. Very recently, the in-flight magazine of American  Airlines identified it as one of the 10 cities of the 21st century. But  Hyderabad is pushing its case aggressively, at times engaging in  needless hype and prickly one-upmanship. The media too is fuelling the  competition.Both are pan-Indian cities although the truly local  content is higher in Hyderabad. Both are vying with each other for the  Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. Both lobbied for a visit  by President Clinton. Both are bidding for an international  airport. Both are on the radar screen of the World Bank. Both are  showcasing themselves as global centres for knowledge-based industries.  Both have embarked on ambitious infrastructure development programmes. Both  have influential diasporas, although Bangalore's is perhaps more  professional than commercial. And both are being led by two of the most  reform-minded politicians, one a high-profile, self-styled CEO and the  other a low-key but no less dynamic personality who faces a more  difficult task given the nature of the political environment in which he  has to function and coming as he does after years of poor governance.There  is another similarity. Both cities are creations of public investment.  Without the public sector in industry, in education and in science and  technology, Bangalore and Hyderabad would not be where they are today.  They have not been intrinsically entrepreneurial cities in the way  Ludhiana or Coimbatore have been. The  impetus for the growth of Bangalore came from companies like ITI, HMT,  HAL, Bharat Electronics, Bharat Earth Movers and BHEL and from  scientific agencies like ISRO, NAL and IRDE. Hyderabad grew  because of companies like BHEL, ECIL, Bharat Dynamics, HMT and IDPL and  scientific establishments like the Nuclear Fuels Complex, DMRL, IICT,  NRSA, NGRI and others. Even though in recent years both cities have attracted private investment, government-funded R&D is still sustaining them.But  there are differences as well. Within Karnataka, Bangalore commands  disproportionate influence in spite of other rich centres like Mysore,  Mangalore, Hubli, Dharwad and Belgaum. Its location in the deep south of  the state has contributed to the neglect of other regions. The  paradox is that while many of the influential politicians of the state  have come from northern Karnataka, investment has tended to take place  largely around Bangalore. Of late, Hubli has been rediscovered  thanks to its being the birth place of the world's second richest Indian  (as of now) Gururaj Deshpande of Sycamore fame. But Bangalore continues  to exercise a stranglehold which is great globally but debilitating  locally.Located in the northwest of the state, Hyderabad is a  little less unfavourably located vis-a-vis the rest of Andhra. And  within that state, cities like Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Warangal,  Guntur and Rajahmundri have emerged as major centres. This is  mainly because Andhra's agriculture has been more prosperous than  Karnataka's-its fertiliser consumption per hectare of cropped area is  double that of Karnataka. Andhra is a major rice producer whereas  Karnataka is a major producer of coarse cereals, although of late it  has emerged as a major horticultural centre. Twenty-four per cent of  India's drought-prone areas lie in Karnataka, thus constraining its  agriculture. Because of greater agricultural surpluses, Andhra  has also witnessed the emergence of many local entrepreneurs who have,  in turn, been nurtured by successive state governments. The focus  of Karnataka since the mid-'70s has been, first, social re-engineering  and, later, democratic decentralisation. Both of these have profoundly  transformed its society. Karnataka's homegrown entrepreneurs are  largely in liquor, banking and professional education. Gone are the days  when a chief minister of Karnataka could be someone who studied in  Osmania University. That showed the composite culture which the  two cities are heirs to and whose legacy should not be forgotten.  Synergies are possible. E-governance is an area of collaboration. The  development of the Hyderabad-Karnatak region and of the Krishna basin  will demand statesmanship on both sides. Taking an even larger  perspective, an isoceles technology triangle with Bangalore, Hyderabad  and Pune at its vertices could also be visualised.The author is secretary of the AICC's Economic Affairs Department.

But not forever.Assumption : There is no other source of nutrition for the hen other than egg.Proof : Let's say it eats an egg which is basically an ellipsoid of semi major axis length a and semi minor axis length b and c in the third dimension. Let's say f is the fraction which is used for metabolism and other shit(I'm good at puns ) .By Law of conservation of mass. Inital Mass = Volume of Ellipsoid * Density of egg.Now,here's the catch.The variation of density of egg protein with temperature is not that much . So,we can rather equate the initial and final volumes.So, Initial Volume = Volume of ellipsoid = 4/3πabcNow,considering the metabolism into picture.Final Volume = (1-f)*Initial Volume = (1-f)4/3πabcSo,the new egg will have a lesser volume.We have completed 1 iteration till now.Now,let's say we start the forced cannibalism again and make it eat it's own egg for let's say n iterations.Final Volume(n) = (1-f)^n * 4/3πabc . Now,the threshold for metabolism is let's say K joules.If the hen doesn't get that much amount,it cannot have a healthy metabolism and will die.So,we observe that,Final Volume(n) is a  monotonically decreasing function.Now,for the hen to live forever,we must take the LIMIT on n to inifinity.So, Lt n-> ∞ Final Volume(n)  =  0 and definitely for a finitely large value of n ,it will go below the threshold K .Conclusion : Hen canot live.I'm sorry.",high,high,high,mid,low
Yash-Bajaj-1,"As a final year student, there are many things that I would like to change academically in IIT Kharagpur.BS/EVS I agree that the Govt. has some norms that BS/EVS should be made compulsory.But,a CS Undergrad studies these subjects in his 6th semester.Right! Just before their internships! Secondly,The course has multi-dimensional portion with professors changing every class and the number of slides being just less than infinity.If it is a common subject to all the streams then why don't we have it in first year ? Semester 1 can have BS . Semester 2 can have EVS. Atleast people will not  get frustrated when they study the diameter of some shit tank used in some medieval age water purifying technique in their 6th semester EVS course. Breadth All we need is I have taken 3 breadths till now and my so-called-overall-development did not happen! I am supposed to take an industrial breadth next semester.I have the same amount of interest in taking a breadth as Rahul Gandhi in Politics. I want to take up a CS elective that has a slot clash with this breadth. :| The whole point I am trying to prove is that stop forcible allocation of breadths.If a student wants to take up his Dept course instead ,let him ? Slide Reading I hate the professors who do mere slide reading in the class -There is a reason why there's a black board in class. Use it. Using slides for the entire lecture gives the student a feeling - ""Oh let's not pay attention,we got the slides anyway"". Secondly,a slide full of text ? Seriously ? Thirdly,If the professor does a slide reading in class without explaining,it's no better than a lullaby. Use a ppt for animations,statistics,pictorial diagrams,structures and maybe examples.Students in 11th and 12th aren't familiar with slides. Atleast use the boards in the Freshman year. English for Communication Don't get me wrong here! I am going to speak about one of my friends X who was from a Hindi medium background. X struggled throughout the semester for English.X scored EX's and A's in all other subjects but scored a D in English. X tried improving in English everyday. They were given a random topic in their English tutorial for which we had to speak for 2 minutes ( A higher form of Just A Minute ) .The dumb T.A  gave the tutorial marks based on this . X got a topic Michael Jackson. X was speechless for minutes and the T.A scolded him,insulted the poor chap.Why not have a English for Communication - Easy & English for Communication - Advanced where the course structure is altered accordingly. The current structure is no good for X or for Y ( Y is good at English )Normalization of Marks in Lab  All the unlucky ones have been a victim of this. Let me explain you . Consider a Rocket Programming Lab.There are 5 T.A's . Let's focus on two of them , Suresh & Mukesh. Suresh is a chilled out 5th year and is extremely lenient in giving marks. He gives on an average 88,92,96,81,92 to five students (The avg has been calculated over 8-10 assignments throughout the semester). Consider Mukesh. He's a sadist ( just saying) , extremely strict ,will deduct 10 marks if he finds  a simple error.He gives on an average 74,79,68,71,73  to five students. Now,let's say 70 % of your grades depend on these marks and the 30 % is a lab test which is in general,an easy one and almost everyone scores the same. So,the key point being here is that the guy who scored 79 from Mukesh's group ends up getting a grade less than the guy who scored 81 in Suresh's group despite being the topper in his group throughout the semester. You might be thinking -   Now,let's normalize their marks. By normalization,the final score of a student is  (score(student)-Mean )/Standard Deviation)Let's do this for Suresh.The marks obtained :  88,92,96,81,92Mean : 89.8Standard Deviation : 5.6745Final scores : -0.37,0.39,1.09,-1.55,0.39Let's do this for Mukesh.The marks obtained : 74,79,68,71,73Mean : 73Standard Deviation : 4.06202Final scores : 0.25,1.48,-1.23,-0.49,0.0Now,the guy who scored 79 in Mukesh's group has a score of 1.48 and the guy who scored 81 in Suresh's group has a score of -1.55. GRADE THEM NOW!I will keep adding as and when I feel that there is something wrong with the system.",high,high,high,mid,low
Yash-Bajaj-1,"For newton's laws to be applied in a non inertial frame of reference,a pseudo force needs to be added to the free body diagram of the object under consideration. A non inertial frame is a frame of reference with non zero acceleration. Consider a rotating frame of reference. Even if it moves with constant speed,it's direction is changing thereby giving a nonzero acceleration. Now,centripetal force is a real force. Mechanical force used to rotate the brick in a circular motion or gravitational force between earth and the sun which keeps the orbit elliptical,these are real forces and act as centripetal force for an inertial frame of reference. But,if you consider a non inertial frame, for example the frame that is attached to the ball that is being rotated at constant speed. It has an inward acceleration of v*v/r where v is the speed and r is the radius of curvature at that instant. For this frame of reference ,the ball is at rest and there is an inward force of gravity/mechanical force. So,for newtons laws to be valid ,an equal and opposite amount of force acts outward termed as centrifugal force. It is a pseudo force. It isn't real. It is used to describe the body when considered under an accelerated frame of reference. The schools have taught us that on a rotating body,there are two forces acting Centripetal and Centrifugal which are equal and opposite to each other and hence the body remains stationary along the radius.This is completely false. Centripetal and Centrifugal force are independently used to describe a body under inertial and non inertial frames respectively. Both cannot act together!! Answer to your question - Gravity is a real force. So, centrifugal force is not a type of gravity. It might be equal and opposite to gravitational force considering a non inertial frame though. :)",high,high,high,mid,low
Yash-Bajaj-1,"Let me give you an example about my second semester at IIT Kharagpur   We had a course on programming (C ) and a lab. I had zero experience in programming . I saw that many people had 2-5 years of experience in JAVA/C++ from their schools. It was the first programming  lab where I saw people completing the assignment in mere 15 minutes where I was struggling with the syntax. It was sad. I thought that we were in a race and the starting line of many of the players were very much ahead of mine. I completed the assignment though in the stipulated time. :)  So,I came to know that I need to burn the midnight oil. I started learning it on my own. Whenever I had the most trivial of the doubts possible,I'd go to an experienced person and ask him . I had been ridiculed and made fun of sometimes for asking stupid doubts as well but I think I don't care much about that until I learn something new . I started putting extra efforts. Implemented my own versions of the codes that were being taught in class be it sorting/stack/queue . I started seeing the difference in the labs as well. I could complete the assignment slightly earlier than others. The time keeping reducing . Although,I couldn't reach few of the so called smarter ones.But,yeah I very well thrashed out few of them. It was the final results where I came to know that I got a 10/10 points in both theory and lab. It was a very ecstatic moment for me as I scored FUCKING BETTER THAN  MOST OF THE SMARTER ONES. Few key points to note :You can cope-up with the smarter ones -By working harder.By learning from the smarter ones.By not hesitating from asking questions even if they might make you look stupid. By not giving up.By having confidence in yourself that you were born to KICK SOME ASS.",high,high,high,mid,low

He put the blanket over me and told me to sleep. Bhaskar's perspective : It was about 4 in the night. I moved my hand and my phone fell off the table . I got down and started searching it. It was dark and I did not want to switch on the light. Suddenly. I hear Yash screaming so much. I was shit scared. My voice changed completely.

You're not the unique person with this disorder ;)I am assuming that you have taken a Algorithms and Data Structure course .Here's a list which you can follow for your internship interviews.1.Get your hands dirty with OOP. I'd recommend C++ and specifically to use the versatility of the standard template library ( stl ) and algorithm library.Explore vectors,sets,iterators (and other design patterns) and efficient use of algorithm library.You know that saves time in competitive coding. 2.Follow a book for Computer Architecture,Operating systems (highly important) and DBMS and Networks. (Note that this is from placement point of view )3.Start competitive coding .Why ? You need to practice for the initial coding rounds.All your knowledge would go in vain if you aren't able to clear the first coding round .So, don't let your coding get rusted.Participate in short contests of codeforces.Try section wise problems on Dynamic Programming,Greedy Strategy,Hashing,Graphs and Trees,Number theory related .You might also want to try out puzzles .It helps to improve your approach towards problems. 4.Go through geeksforgeeks and careercup as well.They have divided the questions based on company and topics.Very informative.

It's a tradition among us to visit all our relatives around Diwali. A couple of nights earlier when my parents went out to visit few relatives,I slept keeping the door open. So,they decided to lock the door from outside as I was sure that I'd sleep early and wouldn't wake up to open the door :P So,I get a call from my Dad  - ""Beta sona mat , ham thodi der mein aa rahe hain "" Those were the last words he spoke to me. I kept watching the movie until I got a call from my sister that my parents met with an accident. On asking I was told that it wasn't that serious but they were panicking and crying on phone. She told she'd come and pick me up to her place. She came to pick me up. I threw the keys from the balcony. She opened the door and we went to her place. Everybody was psyched out there. I did not know what was happening. They told me again that it was a small accident and they're fine. I was told to sleep.

So,here is the hardest part of my life :My head was shaven as it is a Hindu tradition. If I were to meet my mom,she would notice that and come to know about dad. So,for about 15 days I had to ignore meeting her. I used to tell that I am extremely busy with my school,exams pressure etc and used to lie that dad is fine and on bed rest.When the time came,my brother told everything to my mom as he couldn't take it anymore.I met her , saw her and both of us started crying our hearts off.

P-G-Keerthana-Gopalakrishnan,"One such phenomenal experiment is the Bystander Apathy experiment conducted by John Darley and Bibb Latané in the wake of the much publicised murder of Kitty Genovese in 1964. On March 13, 1964 Genovese, 28 years old, was on her way back to her Queens, New York, apartment from work at 3am when she was stabbed to death by a serial rapist and murderer. The attack lasted for at least a half an hour during which time Genovese screamed and pleaded for help. The murderer attacked Genovese and stabbed her, then fled the scene after attracting the attention of a neighbor. The killer then returned ten minutes later and finished the assault. Newspaper reports after Genovese's death claimed that 38 witnesses watched the stabbings and failed to intervene or even contact the police until after the attacker fled and Genovese had died.This was a case that baffled psychologists at the time. 38 witnesses could watch the murder right on the street from their window and not one of them called the police until it was too late. It is a simple matter of picking up a phone and dialing 900. But all 38 of them simply watched.Why were the bystanders so apathetic? Were they held in shock? Is it that New Yorkers in particular were indifferent? The test:In the aftermath of the murder was designed a beautiful experiment to explain the behaviour in which 72 students of the New York University took part. The subject witnesses a victim undergoing what appeared to be a very serious nervous seizure similar to epilepsy. He/she was made aware of the number of other witnesses watching the incident. The independent variable:Number of people the subject thought to be in the group. The dependent variable:  Speed with which the subjects reported the emergency Results:What ensued was something that questioned the very pillars of human morality. It was found that when the subject perceived the victim was alone, 85% of the time he reported it. However, when he was made aware that one other person was watching, the report rate fell to 62%.  In the case when there were four other perceived witnesses, a meagre 31% of subjects came to the victim's help.How do we explain the results?The subject witnessing the attack is in a conflict. At one end are humanitarian responsibilities to help the victim and at the other are rational and irrational concerns against intervention(police procedures, potential physical harm, lost work hours, etc). When you're the sole person watching the seizure, you're the only person in a position to help and hence the burden of blame coming from non-intervention is huge. However, when you're made aware that a number of other people are watching, the responsibility to help gets dispersed and the blame gets dispersed.Takeaway: Too many cooks spoil the broth, sometimes due to too little action than too much. If you're assigning a task, don't be convinced that more people can increase the chances of getting the job done. Sometimes, the mere presence of more people can dissuade one from taking responsibility, and the task is delayed or left undone. This is the bystander effect.Reference: Page on cengage.com",high,mid,high,high,high
P-G-Keerthana-Gopalakrishnan,"Apart from what Adriana Heguy mentioned, I'd remove the current process of overt menstruation and replace it with covert menstruation. Birthrate in India is 2.5 babies per woman while estimated average number of menstrual cycles per lifetime is 450. That is, for every successful offspring, the female parent menstruates 180 times. After attaining puberty, the uterus prepares for fertilisation every month, and 179 out of 180 times, all of that blood and effort goes into waste. 10-35 mL of blood is shed every cycle. Bleeding persists for 4-7 days accompanied by menstrual pain, physical discomfort, mood changes, hygiene issues and chances of infection. In developing countries, anaemia due to iron deficiency is widely prevalent among adolescent girls. In India 23% of girls drop out due to menstruation related problems, who would have otherwise contributed to the global workforce[1]. While cloth  strips have traditionally been used by Indian women who cannot afford sanitary  napkins (70% of women in the survey said they could not afford them), the  survey finds that unsanitised cloth, ashes and husk sand are used by 88% of  women leading to more cases of urinary tract and other infectionsUnsanitary menstrual practices and non-biodegradable sanitary napkins piling up in the environment[2] further the problem. Our society compound the problem with menstruation related discriminatory practices such as barring entry to temples while on period.To sum up, the female reproductive system is very poorly designed in terms of effort vs returns and menstruation is an enormous waste of resources. If I had my way, I'd replace it with estrous cycles where the endometrium or uterine lining is completely reabsorbed by the animal at the end of its reproduction cycle(covert menstruation). This is found in some placental mammals such as cats, dogs and cows among others. It's a better way to utilise resources and avoid the associated drawbacks of menstruation.[1]-Lack of sanitary protection causes 23% of girls to drop out of school[2]-Why are we pretending that there isn’t a growing mountain of menstrual waste we need to deal with?",high,mid,high,high,high
P-G-Keerthana-Gopalakrishnan,"Practice is the key. If you pretend something for long enough, you end up becoming that.1. Keep yourself alert. When you find that you are thinking about others' opinions of you, immediately switch your thoughts saying ""I don't care!"". To every memory of embarrassment, stamp the  phrase ""I don't care"". Every time someone comments at you, dismiss it with a dispassionate I-don't-care(But do retain the constructive part! ). After enough practice, you instinctively tune yourself to push away these worrisome tendencies, that is, to genuinely not care.2. Make a fool of yourselves at times, deliberately.Sport that funny outfit. Trip on the stairs. Eat messily. Lighten your response towards being laughed at. Poke fun at yourself, Embarrassment and the fear of judgement would stop worrying you, with time.3. Learn from your mistakes.Recollect situations where you have felt humiliated, where you have been humiliated. Remember instances where you have acted differently wary of being judged. Reflect what you should have done or how you should have acted, stoically. Imagine yourself doing them. Imagine the reaction of others. Get used to it.4. Finally, identify and act.Contemplate on the norms of the society, and the restrictions you have imposed on you. Like ""Why should I get dressed for a party?"", ""Why should I pick this career?"". Defy them. Try doing things you like to, the way you wish to.It's all about nullifying the factor of social incentive associated with a certain set of options/manners/norms which coerce us to go for them.

Amulya-Shekhar,"I did not foresee this, frankly speaking. I expected one of the 3 players to sulk, and I expressed this opinion early on in the season. But they've gone on to prove me woefully wrong and have exceeded all expectations. I believe that alongwith the trio, Luis Enrique is the man who needs to be thanked by all Barca fans. Recognizing the dimming powers of Iniesta and Xavi, he entrusted greater responsibility to the front 3, to the point where if even one of the 3 is not on the pitch, Barcelona seem to be playing a notch below their best. I'm not jealous, though. I know for a fact that the kind of impact BBC can cause is good enough to help overcome any team. Madrid has been unlucky over the course of the second half of the season, losing players to injuries at crucial points (read: Modric after the clasico). Madrid, unlike Barcelona, are not dependent on a fully functional front three. Their goal threats are spread out all across the pitch, and man-for-man, there is little doubting that currently they're still a better team than Barcelona, both the first XI and the entire squad. Modric and Kroos remain the world's two best medios while Isco and James have had almost impeccable seasons and will only get better with time.I also think Cristiano's best season will be the next. He will have 2 months to himself to holiday and recover from the exertions that he has imposed upon himself over the past 2 seasons. He simply does not look as strong, powerful, speedy and composed as he did back in early '13-14 and the '12-13 seasons. These 2 months off will do him a world of good and get him back in line for a season for the ages. Bale needs to turn more inventive. His role is not peripheral as is being made out by the media, he just doesn't show the cleverness that is required of him at times. His off-the-ball movement requires some serious work. He would do well to take cue from Benzema and Ronaldo, who are 2 of the world's best when it comes to timing runs and making plays by dropping between the lines.All-in-all, my reaction to MSN this season is: Good for ya, Blaugrana! We'll get back to our best in our time, and then you'll need all the luck you can get.",high,mid,high,mid,mid
Amulya-Shekhar,"He does not seem to be what he was. Till the time he played under Mourinho, Casillas seemed to be a really secure goalkeeper. You could place blind faith in him in the big matches to bail out defensive errors on at least one occasion, whether with his positioning and reading of the game, or with barely believable saves. Either way, he was rock solid till the time he featured on every matchday.That only changed once he became the reserve goalkeeper, with Diego Lopez replacing him. Game time is really important for a keeper to be at the top. The reading of the game and positioning become progressively weaker the longer one spends time warming the bench. This is one of the primary reasons why most big clubs with 2 elite goalkeepers don't necessarily feel the same safety when the first-choice keeper is out injured and the other custodian is fielded. Spurs, Real, Barca, Bayern, United are cases in point.The shotstopping of a goalkeeper is rarely affected till he becomes 40-odd and his reflexes and athleticism are depleted. Look at Dida even today.There does not seem to be any decline in his shotstopping abilities whatsoever.Elite goalkeepers are better than the rest because of their ability to foresee how a particular play will advance and then react accordingly. Most professional goalkeepers are good enough as shotstoppers in their own right. This ability, however, is on full display only when the goalkeeper is near his best. It is blunted when the goalkeeper has not been placed in a real match situation for a significant time period.Therefore, Casillas seemed to have lost it at Real for the two previous seasons. The injuries to his hand also seemed to affect his bravery a bit, forcing him into awkward body positions and causing him to react fractionally slower, throwing his body around lesser and showing weaker strength while punching the ball out. Morata's goal in the semifinal second leg, for example, wouldn't have been conceded by a fully confident Casillas. He would have punched it out of play without fuss.",high,mid,high,mid,mid
Amulya-Shekhar,"If I showed this pic to a kid who'd started watching football an year or so ago, he'd fail to recognize who it is in the pic. In fact, he might even mistake him for Matt Damon.This is the perfect question to write a tribute to my all-time favorite footballer.Germany were finalists at Korea-Japan 2002, semifinalists in 2006 and finalists again at Austria-Switzerland 2008. Neverkusen 2002. Chelsea were finalists in the Champions League 2008, semifinalists (we all know what happened in THAT match) in 2009.If you're an avid football follower, you'll have figured out that the one player common to all these teams, and their sore disappointments at missing out on the major honours is a certain Michael Ballack. One of the pioneering midfielders of a generation consisting of Pirlo, Scholes, Gerrard, Lampard, Xavi and Xabi Alonso. Guided Germany, Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and was an important player for Chelsea in their league triumphs. If a bad tackle from Kevin-Prince Boateng had not ruled him out of the 2010 World Cup, Ballack would've been able to play his part in a refreshing performance from Germany, who went into the tournament as underdogs in many eyes after he was ruled out.Long-distance shooting, freekicks, passing range, ability to dictate the game, dribbling in tight areas, on the counter too - Ballack was the complete modern midfielder, and is the epitome of a German player - underrated as fuck. Underrated because very rarely did he actually burst onto the spotlight with a winning side - he lost out to Zidane, Pirlo, Xavi and Scholes over various crucial matches in his career.Perhaps his best period came during the 2001-02 season with Bayer Leverkusen, playing alongside Berbatov and Ze Roberto, similarly criminally underrated players who ALMOST led them to a treble, but then faltered in all three competitions. Defeat is cruel, losing is ignominous, and nobody remembers the 'nearly-there' guys.Ballack is probably the biggest example of such a footballer.Edit: Thanks a lot to Avinash Bhawnani, Quora User, Yedu Krishnan, Harsha Bhat, Yash Kumar Lal and Shubham Singh for promoting my answer!",high,mid,high,mid,mid
Amulya-Shekhar,"Being a Germany, Real Madrid and Ronaldo fan, normally I'd say that Argentina's struggles in the group stages are down to their inferior game-play. And that statement is perfectly true.However, it is important to not give too much importance to how a team plays in the group stages, IF IT'S PLAYING BADLY. France back in 2006, for example, secured only 5 points, but they found another gear in the knockouts and reached the final.Let's try and analyze the 2 matches that have been played.Game 1 vs Bosnia: Argentina's play in the final third was a severe let-down. They had good buildup play, but Aguero was in abysmal form and the 5-3-2 formation wasn't working at all. When Campagnaro was taken off for Higuain, they became a slightly better team, but still they lacked a proper bite in their attack. I put it down to jitters from the initial bad play.Game 2 vs Iran:Try as they might, very few teams in the world can break down two banks of 4 dropping deep and giving defending their first priority. We saw how Brazil and Italy could not break through in their second matches, and Argentina proved to be no different. Their forward play was a lot better this time around, but they were still hesitant to dribble past their opponents and make things happen (played without the cutting edge, again). Messi's class shone through and they managed to nick 3 points when ideally they should've gotten a blob for their efforts.WHAT HAPPENS NOW:Now that they're through as group toppers (probably), Argentina will play with a little more freedom. Nigeria has shown initiative to not sit back, and instead take the game to the opposition with the strength and physicality in its ranks. I expect this game to be an end-to-end match, with Argentina slightly edging it, while being battered defensively.The point is, teams in the knockout stage cannot afford to just sit back and defend if they want a result in regulation time. They have to show some amount of enterprise on the attacking side, to stretch the game. And when the game is stretched, that is when the pace of the likes of Di Maria, Messi, Higuain and Aguero will come through. But again, Argentina are so fragile at the back that I can visualize teams tearing them apart if they play well on the break. So yes, my prediction for Argentina will be: Not better than the semis, and possibly knocked out in the quarters.",high,mid,high,mid,mid
Amulya-Shekhar,"We had this incident in our Mechanics class this week. Section - 7 has its classes in Raman Auditorium (F142).

Amulya-Shekhar,"I started supporting Arsenal because they were one of the first clubs to catch my imagination as I watched them as a young, impressionable kid of 6. The first match I watched was Liverpool vs Sunderland (I forget the result, I thought both teams were shite that day, which is why I did not grow up to become a Red). A few months later, I saw a bald man, a tall, imposing guy playing on the right wing, along with another short, balding southpaw who played down the left, linking up and scoring a goal. Their physical features and flamboyance in the game caught my attention, so I started watching them. One fine day, my dad showed me the balding guy's goal off a stratospheric cross that the shorter, bald guy had delivered, in the highlights of an important match. I didn't know the names of these guys, but apparently they were renowned footballers. I particularly liked a handsome guy who'd scored the first goal that day, I wanted to be like him when I'd grow up. A few days later, in my summer vacations, I saw the FIFA World Cup of 2002, where the handsome guy scored again for Spain (I had read up the Milo book of Facts and knew about a few nations, but not about many clubs). There was a handsome, balding guy who was captain of England and there was this uproar about his penalty against Argentina, which I recall vividly. But there was just one name on the lips of every kid playing with me on the street, even the plump uncles whose sons they were: Ronaldo. I saw his goals against Russia and Turkey, and thought he had to be bloody amazing to be running so fast and dribbling like that despite being fat. I always supported Germany, because I read about the Berlin Wall and stuff, and I somewhat sympathized with what the nation had been through. So I supported them all the way to the final, and Michael Ballack became my favourite player, which he remains to this day. Finally, I saw the World Cup final, when Ronaldo scored 2 more goals. I thought, this guy has to be the best ever. And then I noticed that the short, balding guy was also in the Brazil team with him. I wondered what his name was, and then it appeared on the screen: Roberto Carlos, Number 3.A few days later, I saw photos of him with the balding guy, the handsome guy, who I now knew to be Raul, and the tall right-footer, who turned out to be Figo. The guy was holding up the white T-shirt of the club, who turned out to be Real Madrid. And I thought ""Wow! I should start watching more of him!""This is how I was introduced to Real Madrid CF, my favorite club alongside Arsenal. The Galactico signing policy is the primary reason why I started supporting them (a season later, Becksie joined them too, which I saw in the papers). If I'd seen a Barca player do well at the World Cup (apart from Rivaldo), I might've thought about following them, but there could have been no such event in those early days as far as I can remember, which is why I've always loved Real and loathed Barca with all my heart. :P PS - I think you now know that the 'balding guy' was Zizou, while the handsome guy who played for Spain was Raul.***********************************************************************EDIT: Answering other parts of the question, any inter-city rivalry between the big guns of the 2 biggest cities in the country will definitely be huge, in its own terms, but the primary reason for the El Clasico being the most-watched derby match in the world is Madrid's dominance in the European Cup, which got people from all over the world to recognize them as a force in football, and got them to take a closer look at the club, its traditions and rivalries.Madrid, for the greater part of its post-war history, has been fed by its academy with some transcendent stars who helped Madrid rule the world. Even as Di Stefano and Puskas led the team to domination of the continent, the rest of the first-team was made up mainly of academy graduates, with exceptions like Hector Rial. That was the greatest period in any footballing club's history, let alone Real's.Another great moment was the victory in 1998, ending a long, long wait for the Septa, which had been coveted over the years, but even Hugo Sanchez and the Quinta del Buitre couldn't land it. It ushered in 5 more years of domination on the European scene.Probably the worst moment for the club would've been the home defeat to Barcelona at the fag end of the 2009 season (6-2). There was simply no defending to speak of, and having been unceremoniously dumped from the Champions League for 6 seasons running, fans began questioning the club's hierarchy about their desire for continental glory. This led to the re-election of Perez, who initiated another spending spree and started the long walk towards relevance.I have not seen a better team, bursting with talent and players at the peak of their powers, than Barca, circa 2010, with Xavi, Iniesta, Toure, Puyol, Pique, Henry, Zlatan and a certain Leo Messi; with perhaps the exception of Bayern Munich 2013. Bayern Munich of the season 2012-13 might have been the most complete squad in the history of club football. I also hold the 2011-12 Real Madrid squad in very high regard for the amount of versatility and depth of the squad and entertaining nature of their game (they pumped in 121 goals in 38 league matches, enjoying high amounts of possession).",high,mid,high,mid,mid
Amulya-Shekhar,"ISL has it much easier than EPL in terms of getting absolute numbers of followers. India itself is a market big enough which, if exploited well enough, can generate enough fan following and revenue for the league to be a well-known one, quite like the Chinese Super League.The concept itself is quite favourable in the terms of getting the idea of football across to the average Indian citizen. If the league becomes a structured one at some point in the future and integrates itself with the I-League, that should keep ISL in focus for the major chunk of the year and prevent viewer fatigue. Viewer fatigue is only a factor when you need to pull stunts to gain following for a particular event, and a league structure consuming 9+ months of the calendar year is, thus, a regular phenomenon and will avoid viewer fatigue.Therefore, for ISL to be commercially successful on the lines, it has to:(i) Penetrate and exploit the Indian market to as big a degree as possible;(ii) Become a regular, year-long league instead of the current model which induces temporary interest like the IPL.(iii) Significantly improve grassroots level football of the country so that local players can add to the attraction of the league, instead of star names like Roberto Carlos having to do the job.",high,mid,high,mid,mid
Amulya-Shekhar,"Cristiano Ronaldo is perceived as an arrogant person because: (a) He is a very expressive person on the pitch. (b) He is a perfectionist and has an insane appetite for goalsThese two traits of his personality combine to form an on-field image of a frustrated individual when things aren't going his way and that of a larger-than-life persona who is the centre of attraction when things are going his way. Thus, somebody who bases his observations of Ronaldo's nature solely on the basis of what he does on the pitch will have his fair share of reasons to consider him an arrogant, aloof figure.But if it were to be a true image and Cristiano Ronaldo was actually arrogant, we would see some sort of evidence off the pitch. Kobe Bryant, who is a notoriously competitive and arrogant figure in basketball, has had a lot of friction with a number of teammates and opponents. There is no record of any teammate having had a problem with Ronaldo, ever. If such an incident had taken place, the media would've taken all the pains to make it public, therefore the fact that there isn't any such headline is an exceptionally strong indicator that he doesn't have any problems off the pitch. Gerard Pique, his teammate-turned-rival, has only nice things to say about him. Therefore, in my view, it is plain shallow of people to judge Ronaldo as arrogant based on his on-field actions.",high,mid,high,mid,mid
Amulya-Shekhar,"Thanks for the A2A!This experience happened when I was playing in one of my last school-level tournaments, the Inter-DPS Football Under-19 Zonals, hosted by DPS Indore (I represented DPS Bhopal).It was a group stage match against the hosts, and a lot of pride was at stake because the 2 schools have the same owner, and ours is the older and more prestigious establishment, and we've always had the bragging rights. Now, what happens in many school-level tournaments is, the referees are tipped to favour to host team. And when I say favour, it means favour heavily. Ours was easily the better team of the two, but with the biased refereeing, we were having to play with our backs to the wall. I was the goalkeeper. The other team pressed on and on: peppered in crosses into the box, penetrated the defense on a few occasions and got away a few shots. But I was in my element that day, in fact, all of our team were probably playing their best football. I made a save at one end, and started a counter-attack, somewhere close to the 15th minute of the first half. It finished with the ball in the back of their net. We were all pumped up after that, but then the referee started giving even more biased decisions. We scraped in after the first half with the score intact, and our coach, Pankaj Das sir told us to keep up the tempo.In the second half, I made the save of my life. There came in a shot from just outside the box on the half-volley. I was wrongly positioned, somewhere close to my right post. I dived away to my left and kept out the ball. That fraction of a second, in which I was full stretch in mid-air, with no thought in the world other than keeping the ball out, was an exhilarating one. Buoyed by this save, the team managed to hang on and win the game 1-0. And I was paid the best compliment of my life by our coach, Pankaj Das sir, one of those people I look up to the most. He said that my save reminded him of Oliver Kahn. Great experience, that match, and probably the best 70 minutes of my life. Capped off by the compliment.

He achieved this feat against Dundee United plying his trade in the Scottish Premier League. Even magisterial Messi has achieved this feat once in his career, not more.Why every time, you ask?

Samidha-Paroha,"Let's face it, most people use which and that interchangeably, when in fact, they impart subtly different meanings to the sentences they are used in. Hopefully the following example will clear the air around the two usages. Which is a non-restrictive clause, whereas that is a restrictive clause. Allow me to explain how. Example : A) Books that have blue covers are old.B) Books, which have blue covers, are old. The above two sentences, despite sounding similar, bear slightly different meanings. Sentence A restricts the set of books that we are talking about to books with blue covers. So, that is a restrictive element in a sentence and is used when we want to limit our subject set (books in this case). Statement A can thus be translated to : The blue-covered books are old.On the other hand, sentence B is just adding information about the books that we are referring to. So, which is a non-restrictive element to be used when we do not want to limit our subject set and want to add some extra information. In our example statement B, this extra information is that the books have blue covers. Statement B can be translated to : All the books are old, and they have blue covers! (Just to clarify, all here is all the books in the example and not all the books in the world!)We thus generally use which with commas surrounding it, just to be clear that it is added information. BTW, we can also use restrictive clauses along with non-restrictive clauses in the same sentence!Example : Books that are kept on the shelf, which have blue covers, are old.

Samidha-Paroha,"Have you observed that a lot of horror movies tend to have a blue tint? Like there's some kind of a mandatory rule to scare people. Consider these movies that shout out blue :  1. The Ring : The movie is so blue that soon the kids will be taught The Ring as an example of blue colour in schools. This is the bluest movie ever!2. Saw : The entire bathroom sequence is blue in the movie. I mean literally! The people are wearing blue, the tiles look a shade of blue, the floor has a blue tint. The blood is probably the only starkly different colour in the sequence.  3. The Grudge : It seems like they had grudges with other colours.4. Halloween : Halloween blues? 5. The Exorcist : Okay, this was one blue movie. Even the scary lady wore blue. Then there are other genres, such as apocalyptic or war movies which tend to use a shade of grey to reflect gravity and the scenes usually look washed out. For instance : 6. American Sniper : Take this latest movie as an example, all the scenes of the war have a military-greyish-greenish tinge, which seems just about right!7. Terminator Salvation :  8. Edge of tomorrow : I could go one with this, but I think you get the idea. Basically a lot of times, we can just watch a scene from a movie and judge its genre based on the colour tint. What's this all about?This is digital colour correction and this has been in practice since earlier days of film-making. At that time, people had to go through a lot of pains to get the desired colour palette in their movies for that fine artsy touch, there had to be coloured cellophanes and filters on cameras, coloured lights of just the right intensity and fitted at just the right angles had to be used.Colour correction is far easier now.

Samidha-Paroha,"Interesting question.Our rather gimmicky procrastinator brain often ends up trying to associate the importance of a work to be done, with how long it'll take to complete it. The devil in our heads makes us think so. Our mind is awash with procrastination at this point. Then comes the big question. Should we or should we not do it? I am a procrastinator too, also of the highest order. I have always been one. For this reason, I tried to analyse what causes me to be so. And I found my exact same situation demonstrated wonderfully in a computer science concept known as the hill climbing problem. Consider your life to be a a hilly terrain with several small and huge hills surrounding you. And you are dropped at a random spot in this terrain. Consider these hills to be the highs of your life, highs in terms of a success or happiness or doing something that serves your short-term or long-term goals. You have to now figure out on your own what path to take in order to reach the top of one of the hills. One of the naive approaches to this problem would be to move in a direction that takes you higher than your current position. However, reaching the top of a hill is not the real problem! The real problem is- a) Not moving at all, stalling at the same point (procrastinating)b) Climbing the smaller hill (fulfilling short-term goals or settling for local maxima of happiness and forgetting the real long-term life goals)You got it right. The problem with this approach is that we start towards a smaller hill and end up on top of a smaller hill before we know it. Then we think that we've achieved our goal! Why not wait for a quick snack before beginning to work again? And that little snack ends up being your biggest mistake :-/This smaller hill is the distraction that you are talking about in your question. We either give up or stall after reaching one of those smaller hills. They are the real villains in our lives. Reason?Fake satisfaction of having accomplished something - We think we're done for the day and get satiated with the smaller hill, pushing the real goal out of our heads and focussing on something moronic instead.Getting distracted by the short-term happiness of being at the top - More likely than not, this is the most common reason for procrastination. I have been a victim to this too. We are so happy with our short-term success that we decide we should ""live in the moment"" and ""enjoy present moment"", because ""you never know what might happen tomorrow"" . Yes, the bullshit we keep telling ourselves. Failing to see that this is indeed just a smaller hill - This is the most dangerous of them all. If you don't even realise that you've got the disease, you haven't even diagnosed it, it becomes highly unlikely that you could fix it. We all have that devil in us who gives a false sense of gratification or satisfaction and stops us from taking rational decision of NOT climbing the wrong hill!  :-/ But then, we know that this is not a way to live. The devil cannot be made incharge of our decision-making process. We have got to solve this problem before it gets to the point of a nail-biting deadline. Now that we have diagnosed the problem, lets dig a little deeper and try to fix it. To organize your work and eliminate the procrastinating period, we could try a couple of hacks - Understand your approach and the shortcomings in it - This is easier said than done. We just tried to figure out the problem above. About 80%-90% of the people would relate to one of those, but for those unfortunate 10%-20%, perplexed is the only state they'd be. Parkinson's law : Increase the demand, which'll cause the supply to increase too - This is one logical approach for all the procrastinators out there. This is a general business approach, which can prove to be highly useful if put to use in real life. Procrastinators and bad-organizers tend to put off work until the last moment. Why? Because they can afford to do so. What if they have the deadline tomorrow, and they don;t have a single minute to sit idle. Yes, they would work then. They would have to. Problem solved. Pareto's law : Apply the 80/20 rule : The whole concept of input and output is over-hyped. No one is asking you to stick your butt on that study table all day to bring results. The simple point I am trying to make here is that your 80% output would come from your 20% honest and dedicated input. You don't necessarily have to bust your butt for 100% of the time. Quality of your effort matters more than the quantity. Conclusion - a) Stop correlating completion time with relevance, before you even start doing something. b) Stop getting distracted by the smaller hills, and don't stall on them once you reach the top of a smaller hill. It won't help at all. Once you realise you're climbing the wrong one, get off immediately and head off the the taller hill, no matter how much progress you've made climbing the present one.

Samidha-Paroha,"Did you know that among the 1.4 million people all over the world who are living below $1 a day, about 70% are women and girls?Did you know that women account for around two-thirds of the world's working hours and earn only 10% of the world's income?Did you know that women produce HALF of the world's food and own only 1% of its land? And of the 900 million adults worldwide who cannot read or write, about two thirds are women!? Need I say more?Simple put, women and girls are the most potentially capable untapped resource on the face of the earth. And this is why we need women empowerment. Also, this is why the Gender Equality goal of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals is so important. Women empowerment means marginalizing power in women and girls so that they can play a significant role in the society! After being suppressed in a patriarchal world for so long, women just need a little help to raise their voices against oppression, female foeticide, rapes, dowry, gender equality and more. Ending lasting problems like poverty means realising individual potentials of the people on earth and how much they could be worth, if given a chance. And this begins with women empowerment and gender equality. After all, as Malala said, extremists have shown what frightens them the most, a girl with a book.  Why is that 64% of the 4th grade girls said they liked science and math when only 18% of all college engineering majors were females? See?However, looking at the bright side, as the new generation proceeds to eliminate some engaging issues, women empowerment gets more and more real and as it seems, it is here to stay. Because, women are not the edge of reason, they are the reason itself. They are beginning to raise their voices, akin Leslee Udwin who had the nerve to valiantly admit on a public platform of having been raped, and to unflinchingly protest for her brilliantly documented film called India's Daughter, where she showcases that the true evil in a rape case is not the rapist, but the society itself who demeans the rape victim beyond revival. Incidentally, I am writing this answer on International Women's Day! So, if we all do our part, it's a world within our reach. Cheers! :)",high,mid,high,mid,low

Samidha-Paroha,"Thanks for A2ATLDR: Because of the mystery element. If you do not put all your cards on the table at once, people are going to guess what the remaining cards are. And the judgements they make are not always correct. Go ask out an introvert and he'd probably be like, ""I'd love to hang out, but I have to go sit in my house by myself...""Thus introverts are often mistaken for being either arrogant or shy. The concept has been misunderstood for a long time now and there are many common stereotypes surrounding introverts. Let me quote some of them. 1. You fall in either of the two categories- extroverts or introvertsBelief: You are either an introvert or an extrovert.Fact: Think of introversion and extroversion as falling on a continuum. “Most people fall somewhere in the middle”Their is a third category called ambiverts who lie somewhere in the middle. 2. If you are an introvert, you must be shyBelief: Introverts are shy.Fact: There are certainly shy introverts. But introversion and shyness are not synonymous. Introverts just “seem shy because they tend to think before they speak""3. You cannot be a good speaker if you are an introvertBelief: Introverts don’t make good public speakers.Fact: “At least half of people who speak for a living are introverted in nature""4. You speak less if you are an introvert.This is the most common misconception. NO introverts do not speak less. They just think before they speak. 5. You are arrogant because you didn't reply immediately to my question.I have personally faced this a lot. People mistake your immediate silence following a question or in between a conversation to be arrogance. You are entitled to being rude for your introversion. NO my introversion is NOT my arrogance.I could keep on quoting such common misconceptions, but that would be too rhetoric. No,introverts are not weird, no they are not arrogant or shy or depressed. They just like to be on their own sometimes.Coming to the next part of the question, first let me explain what exactly the lemon test is. Lemon juice is literally mouthwatering; when you drop a bit of it on your tongue, your body produces saliva. Some psychologists think there's a particular system in the brain the Reticular Activating System or RAS, that responds to stimuli including food and social contact. Their theory is that introverts have more RAS activity than extroverts, even when it's not stimulated, and that a small stimulus produces a large response. Similarly, when introverts meet people they have a stronger response (which I guess includes nervousness and anxiety and a feeling of please leave me alone). Extroverts, on the other hand, produce less saliva in response to lemon juice and are more comfortable with social contact.So, yes I do believe the test has some amount of credibility, however I also will not completely rely on my stimuli to define my social or personal attributes. The next part of the question says how should an extrovert deal with an introvert. Here goes-Choose one-on-one conversations over large group gatherings. Introverts are more comfortable conversing with a couple of people rather than exchanging at large.Let them retreat if they are unwilling. It might be the case that they are unwilling to participate in several social events at once. Give them the free will.Censor yourself when necessary. Remember, you are an extrovert, they are not. You might cause them discomfort by blabbering endlessly. Make them feel comfortable around you. Do not pressurize them for socializing. It should not seem a burden to interact with you. They'll open up when they are ready. Give them a quieter environment if necessary.For the last part of the question, which asks whether they are compatible with each other, yes very much. They are people too, with all kinds of traits just like their extrovert counterparts. They will be compatible and incompatible just like everyone else.

Samidha-Paroha,"I remember that one time when I was called for a debate, I was nervous as hell, cold sweat all over my hands, legs trembling as I walked to the stage. But I had learned one simple thing up to that point, no matter what goes inside my head, my face should only reflect confidence. And that is what I did. I went on the stage, looked at the audience and then it vanished, my fear vanished. Poof! Just like that. I was no longer aware of the cold sweat dripping from my hands. My legs had stopped shivering. All I knew was that this was it. I had to deliver to the 500 elites facing me. And that is what I did! This is too rhetoric but I am going to state it anyway. In any discussion, all that matters is the appearance of winning it. The point that I am trying to make is that no matter which stats go against you, or which point are you weak at, if you appear to be winning a debate, you usually win it. Bonus technique : I learned the Head-surfacing technique in my early oration days. It proved to be one of the most effective and practical debating techniques that I learned from my entire oratory experience. Allow me to explain how it works.Remember how people tell you that you need to make an eye contact with the audience while speaking? Well, they don't literally mean it. This is the crux of the head-surfacing technique. I used to run my eyes over the heads of the entire audience in the hall, not resting my eyes on any single person. Looking directly into their eyes usually made me nervous, because people start reacting to what you are speaking and the intake of their responses affects your speech. Who wants a real time review? What if you're looking at someone and they start yawning at your face. You'd start stammering right from the next word you utter. And that would be a disaster, wouldn't it?!And lastly, but most importantly, be polite. It should never look like an argument, because only intellectuals can debate, idiots just argue.",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"1. CasteismIndia - World's biggest democracy OR world's biggest social segregation?Can we ever cast the casteism out?I hate that the blight of caste system has spread in India, virtually unnoticed, and we still claim to be an educated and united country. Why do we keep forgetting that man made the society, and not vice versa!!I hate that your surname matters more that your actual identity in India. I mean, seriously! Grow up, junta! The so-called upper castes take pride at being upper castes, while nobody really gives a fuck about them being the upper castes. And the remaining lower castes  take the leverage of being in the lower castes by en-cashing the reservation system of India, which I think will never come to an end, because no political party would want to disrupt their vote-banks.I hate that it is more important to be a person from some X caste, than to be a good human. Humanism has subsided below the shallow mountain of caste hierarchy. There are certain dialogues from certain movies, that you never forget, this dialogues from My Name is Khan is one of them. If only, people ever understood this.Razia Khan: Remember one thing, son. There are only two kinds of people in this world. Good people who do good deeds. And bad people who do bad. That's the only difference in human beings. There's no other difference. Understood? What did you understand? Tell me. Tell meRizwan Khan: Good people. Bad people. No other difference.2. SexismI hate the overly chauvinistic assertions that have increasingly intimidated girls in the recent years, ex - girls cannot drive, girls suck at XYZ subject, girls have to make round rotis.  Remember the infamous xkcd cartoon?I hate that girls have to listen to crap like ""if you study so much we wont be able to find a guy for you"".I hate that if a girl gets raped, she gets alienated from the society, nobody ""marries"" her, nobody talks to her, she is looked down upon, while the rapist roams around freely eyeing other catches. And if this wasn't enough, people even turn the tables on the girl saying that she wore a short dress/she was roaming around with a guy, this is the reason she was raped.I hate that if a hiring company doesn't hire a girl, she has to listen to ""girls cannot do that work"", and if the company does hire a girl, she has to listen to ""they favored you because you are a girl"".I hate the infinite stereotypes that girls in India have to succumb to. The societal pressure only adds to the false perception.I hate that Indian parents compliment their daughters by saying, ""You are not my daughter, you are my son!"", when she makes them proud. Another reinforcement of patriarchy. I hate that if I put up a picture with two of my guy friends on social network, my relatives ask me to take it down, because ""people will think I have no values because I hang around with boys"", while if my brothers do the same, nobody gives a flying fuck.If you don't understand how casteism or sexism works, you could either be its next victim, or you could be one of the people charging taunts at other people in the name of your caste or gender.I second Hilary Clinton's perspective on the matter.The sexist comments and the racist slurs are bad, because they are being washed, re-clad in Armani, presented back in high society, made to look innocent, and after all this they will be cropping up much more frequently everywhere, aimed at everyone who qualifies to be their victim. THAT's what is bad about them.How can I make that any stronger and clearer? It can be any of us women or any person of color or both that will suffer from the new domestication of sexist and racists taunts. Any Of Us.",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"A very recent incident brought me to answer this question. You know, what I learned as a kid was not being pretentious. I was taught to be straight forward. Not rude or offensive. But fake flattery was the one thing I could never learn, which is why I always thought the people who were being nice to me actually liked me. Fake, I did not know. As Khaled Hosseini puts it:And that's the thing about people who mean everything they say.They think everyone else does too.But then I grew up and it started dawning upon me, that there is more than real in this world. There is fake, there is mean, there is nasty and there is evil. People are not all rosy. And even if they are, that does not mean they are actually roses. Initially it bothered me very much when someone bad mouthed me. Or when I got to know that someone whom I counted as a close friend, wasn't a well-wisher after all. I felt betrayed. I felt pissed. I felt back-stabbed.I thought it would stop bothering me as I grow up. But it didn't.I still got pissed when I came to know a friend said something behind my back. Or when I realized I wasn't wise enough to choose my allies carefully. They had been bad mouthing me since over an year.  In some cases, they were not even close friends. Just acquaintances, who did not even know me well. But they found it convenient to comment on me without even knowing me enough. They called me a faggit, a loser, and what not! This kept bothering me, until one day I decided to solve this once and for all, and be done with it. So, what were my options?I considered going up to them and telling them they needed to get a life and that they needed to SUCK IT! Then I considered doing the exact opposite. I considered being overly nice to them to make them realize that I wasn't a bad person after all. But I didn't know fake flattery, remember?And finally, I considered completely ignoring them, not treating them as friends, and not treating them as enemies either. Just treating them as non-existential. But then I realized, doing any of the above would simply mean that I will keep holding grudges, and not letting it go will lead me into a muckier shit where I will be dragged into the swamp and I will have to relive the negative emotions over and over again. So, I decided that the issue was with me! I had to deal with myself! Why was it bothering me that a bunch of people that do not even know me keep saying horrible stuff about me? And not just those strangers, even when I found out about my ""friends"", I needed to ask myself, were they ever really my friends in the first place? May be you were unreadable! When you are mysterious or difficult to ""read"", people just choose the easier way out by passing a judgement over you and getting done with it. Why bother finding out your real personality, when there is an easier option of passing a one sentence comment about you? You need to realize that it is not actually their ""opinion"" when they say something bad about you. Most of the times, people don't even remember saying things that you have been sulking about for a long time. You cannot please everyone!Sometimes we over-think way too much. I mean, c'mon, who doesn't have enemies? People will keep condemning you or your work until you have enough substance to shove it in their faces. Then those fickle-minded bastards will start following you. It means that you have stood up for something in your life. Remember that they talk behind your back, because that's where they belong, behind you. Zoom out a little!When we look at our problems up too close, they seem big. So, zoom out a little. These bad-mouthing back-talkers are insignificant in your life. They are not your friends, and more often than not, they do not even deserve to be your enemies. Reserve those enemy spots for better people, because your enemies define you. And lastly, you now what? Forgive them. Nothing will annoy them more :P",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Manhattan! Although it is not exactly a city, but it is one of the most famous and the most densely populated boroughs of the New York City. You know how they say you can never get lost in Manhattan? Well, they seem to be absolutely right! Don't believe it? Let me walk you through the extremely thoughtful street structure.The Basic FundaManhattan business district has a street layout like that of a grid, consisting of the streets and the avenues. Yes! Streets are different from avenues! And there is a specific reason behind the naming of each one of them. Now, the important thing to note here is that streets run east to west whilst the avenues run north to south. It is important to keep this fact straight before heading onto further details. Also, in case you are not already aware, this giant grid of Manhattan district comes in pretty handy for a tourist as well as usual New Yorker, for instance when someone tells you XYZ place is at 45th street between 4th and 5th avenue, you can not figure out the exact block they are referring to, that is, the block on the 45th street that lies between the 4th and 5th avenues. This also becomes useful while measuring distances!  AvenuesThe entire business district of Manhattan is divided mainly into 11 avenues numbered 1 to 11, with the 1st starting at the East side of the town, beginning at the East River and the 11th at the far opposite West side. So, the avenues are numbered from East to West. 5th avenue divides the town into East side and the West side. The parts of the streets to the east of the 5th avenue are known as East xx Street, whilst the streets to the west of the 5th avenue are known as the West xx Street. (Remember streets ran from wast to west?!)Some of these avenues have their own personalized names too! But I heard a mnemonic somewhere to keep in mind the order of the avenues with their personalized names.  “You take a CAB back home if it’s Late PM.”This helps you recall the order of the avenues on the west side: Columbus, Amsterdam, Broadway. Then the avenues on the east side: Lexington, Park, Madison.StreetsIf we assume the columns of our grid layout to be the avenues, then the rows would be the streets. Mostly the streets allow one-way traffic but there are a certain exceptions to this akin the 14th. 23rd or the 42nd streets which do allow two-way traffic. An easy to not get confused by this, is to remember that even numbered streets have eastbound traffic while the odd numbered streets have westbound traffic. BroadwayNow comes the very important part of our grid, which does not actually lie in the grid is the Broadway! It defies all the rules mentioned above and runs from Upper West Side all the way down to the Southeast side, intersecting almost all the avenues on its way.  Street SignsIn Manhattan, an interesting thing to note is that the colour of the street signs have meanings too! You would be amazed to discover that if the street signs have a black background, it means you are standing in the financial part of the town (akin the Wall Street), if the street signs have brown background, you are standing in the historical part of the town (since the brown signs were adopted in the 1900s) and if the street signs are blue or green instead, you are probably in a residential area or any other general part of the town! Isn't it quite simple to figure out?! At this point, I would like to mention again that all the above rules apply to the giant grid in Manhattan, however the gridless part of the town has its own rules for navigation which, once known, would make roaming around in them easy too! Often, the most fun people have in New York is while wandering on the streets, discovering small restaurants with native cuisines and meeting new people, rather than visiting the cliched tourist spots. It was a love at first sight for me, but as I got to know the place better over the course of my visit to NY, I loved it even more. So you might think I am biased towards my love, but I am sure you'd agree once you experience it yourself :)",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"One day you wake up and decide that you need to shake up your belief mechanism, you need to stir your natural instincts to the very core. Why exactly?Often we end up in circumstances we never really wanted to be in, and nonetheless we somehow keep chasing our distorted perception of the future. We give up just when we need to push harder and keep persisting when we should have quit a long time ago. Well good news!! We have a chance to spare ourselves the misery and knit a new wonderful life as a whole new person. A complete reinvention of our values, believes, our personality, our weaknesses. How you ask?Reinvention means change; a massive gigantic change. And changes are never easy. Then how do we go about it?Step 1 : AssessAsk yourself why did you fail that one thing you thought you would never fail at? Were your actions flawed? Figure out what mistakes you committed knowingly or unknowingly. Then ask yourself, the most difficult question on earth - Who do you think you are? What we think about ourselves matters more than what others think about us. Yes that's true, doesn't look like it, but is indeed 100% true. Confront yourself. We fear our own conscience more than anybody else on this planet. Step 2 : Build a new roadThere are two kinds of people in this world - those who give up and those who don't take NO for an answer. So what if the road you were walking upon suddenly came to an abrupt end? Understand that endings are good too! They make you savor the taste of the sweet while you still have it. But what do we do now? We build a new road. A fresh start. A clean slate. Step 3 : Execution Now that you know your flaws and weaknesses, we are good to go. Dive in the pool of reinvention! And this is how you can do that-Travel - Someone once said ""To travel is to live"". Quite true. The knowledge and exposure you get while travelling is unparalleled. Life is an adventure. We need to take risks. Sometimes there are bends on the road, and we don't know where the bend may lead. But that's the thing about life. The more unpredictable it is, the more fun we have. So pick up your bags, and jump on the train. Read books - You must have heard that a reader lives a thousand lives before he dies, and the man who never reads lives only one. Enjoy the pleasure of smelling the fresh pages of a new book and experience the joy of completing a book. And by the way, books can be our true friend too! Added plus ;) So go to a bookstore, grab a book and spend some time with your new friend. Stop giving a fuck about what people think about you - There will always be those chaar log who will keep saying things behind your back, or will keep judging you. They thrust their skewed opinions on your face and ask you to live with that. The day you stop giving a flying fuck will be the day you truly start loving yourself.  Meet new people - Stop fussing about who's there for you and who's not. The world is full of all sorts of people. So, give yourself a break, go out there and make some new friends.Invest in people, they will be there for you when money or time isn't.Do what you love - Finally, the most important step towards reinventing yourself is doing what you love. Spend more time discovering what you like. For instance, I like writing and so I find myself writing quite often. And whenever I finish an answer on quora, I feel very good about myself. Try to learn this from kids, they are so engrossed in the things they love to do, that they forget they have poopie in their pants :PSee! That's the thing about life. It's full of happiness, only if you know where to look. There you go! You have just invented a whole new person :)",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Disclaimer : This is my personal view on the topic and I do not mean to reinstate any side of the story.Before explaining my point of view, let's get a quick look at how the test was implemented, and what were the results. The Clark Doll Test was conducted to illustrate the racial stereotyping in America and how it affects the racial perception of young children at the age of 5. In the experiment, Clark showed black children with ages ranging from 6 to 9, two dolls, one white and the other black, and were asked the following questions in order:Show me the doll that you like best or that you would like to play with.Show me the doll that is the 'nice' doll.Show me the doll that looks 'bad.'Give me the doll that looks like a white child.Give me the doll that looks like a colored child.Give me the doll that looks like a Negro child.Give me the doll that looks like you.The researchers found that black children often chose to play with the white dolls more than the black ones. Among the subjects, 44% said the white doll looked like them.My answer : Yes the conclusions are correct. Children are blind to racism, this is a myth and has been frequently challenged by various experiments. I think Clark test has been a huge benchmark in this regard. Young children are not immune to racial stereotyping and they have internalized racism. (Analogous to Jews perceiving themselves as inferior beings during pre-WW2 era)Television and other media is highly responsible for this perception in kids. But are we as a society responsible for it too in some way? Yes. And this makes me sad. We have perpetuated a standard of skin color among ourselves and that has flown into young children through media (or society?). This self-perception as black dolls being inferior to the white dolls will follow the kids into their adult lives and will continue to demean them ever after. What is even worse is that companies are capitalizing on the insecurity of young black girls and their reluctance in buying black dolls. (as seen from the results of the test). This can be judged from the following example- Journalist Stephen J. Dubner shared on his Freakonomics blog anecdotal evidence of what is potentially a combination of racial and price discrimination: If you were shopping on Amazon.com for a Caucasian Dollhouse, the price was $63.99.However, if you wanted an African American Dollhouse, the price was only $37.99.The direct implication of the above is devaluing of the black doll, hence devaluing the black kids. There is a need for restructuring the whole belief system, because racist stereotypes have crept in young children now! And to make things worse, companies are making money from it!! Seriously?!Children are like potter's clay, you can shape them any way you want, and the way you shape them now will define their perception of the world for their entire lives.-Source",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"By facing it.Let me explain this to you by a story. There was a lion who feared nothing except the crowing of roosters. A chill would go down his spine whenever he heard a rooster crowing. One day he confessed his fear to the elephant, who was greatly amused. “How can the crowing of a rooster hurt you?” he asked the lion,“Think about it!”. Just then a mosquito began circling the elephant’s head, frightening him out of his wits. “If it gets into my ear I’m doomed!” he shrieked, flailing at the insect with his trunk. Now it was the lion’s turn to feel amused.If we could see our fears as others see them we would realize that most of our fears make no sense! This is a popular folklore that I was told when I was a kid. And it took me two decades to finally appreciate its significance.  Man has countless enemies, the worst of which is fear. I say this because fear is the only virtue that we create in our own heads and then allow ourselves to be a hostage of something that doesn't even exist in the first place. Don't mistake it with concern. Concerns have reasons. Fear is pointless. And it sucks you in like a blackhole. If you keep fighting it out, you'll perhaps win in the short run. But the same fear will venture back someday. On the other hand if you face it today, you're free forever. Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free. ~ Jim MorrisonWhat you can do as of now -Pick a pen and a paper and make a list of what scares you. Write it down in every minuscule detail, say I am afraid I'll never be able to buy that car, I am afraid that I'll never be able to ask out that girl, I'll never be able to go to that movie next Saturday. Doing this will clear your head of unforeseen fear. We can face the fear only if we know what exactly the fear is.Now pick each point from the list above, and think what percentage of the remedy is in your hands. Write it down below that point. Then think about what is not in your control. Write that down too below that point. Now keep aside this page and pick a fresh page. Write on top ""My Vision Board"" . Transform your points from your fear-list into your vision board. Fear-List  -> Vision BoardI am afraid I'll never be able to buy that car -> I want that car.I am afraid that I'll never be able to ask out that girl -> I want to be with <....>.I'll never be able to go to that movie next Saturday -> I want to watch <....> movie next Saturday.See?Your fears can be converted into productive dreams, only if you learn to get past them.

Samidha-Paroha,"No. Absolutely not. But ironically, it governs the whole world.It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see. Hitler thought Jews were not fit to survive. Terrorists think it is okay to randomly kill someone in the name of religion.Perception is like relative velocity. We tend to compare something or someone relative to our own perception. And thus, what we infer is relative to our belief structure, and not absolute in judgement. Person A, who's in a moving car, will think he's at rest, because he's thinking relative to the point of reference of the car. That's his perception. Whereas, person B, who's standing still on the road would be able to see that person  A is moving along with the car at a certain velocity. Reality is an absolute scale. And perception is relative. Your opinion is your opinion. Your perception is your perception. Wars have been fought and millions have been killed because of difference in perception. But people still don't understand the fact that perception is different from reality, and that everyone has their own perception of the world. Everyone thinks their perception is reality. So, there becomes millions of realities, when in fact there was only one. To them, reality is like a fluid, it takes the shape of the container it is put in. Imagine a spider's web. It is home for the spider and chaos for the fly. Perceptions of the web are different for both, but reality is the same.",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Okay, I'll try to explain this in the simplest way possible. I worked on a couple of projects during my undergraduate internships that implemented the functionality of various ETL tools like Informatica, Teradata, Clover ETL , Snaplogic, etc. If you want to deploy a system of business intelligence or analyze old records for your information system, data quality is one of the top concerns! For a company to thrive in the market today, data consolidation and analysis is critical, quite literally. Our very own ETL process comes into picture here. From what I gathered about the whole process, ETL is a tree step process in database management and data warehousing - Extract the data from various sources into a single repository, that could be homogeneous or heterogeneous. Those data sources can be relational databases, spreadsheets, XML files, CSV files etc.Transform the data into the desired schema. This could include various mapping functions to cleanse the data before it is moved into the new system, or filtering the data to make it concise and ready to use, or changing the data format using certain rules or lookup tables (since the format of the old system could differ from the new one!)Load the transformed data into the destination database, or the warehouse. Notice here, that we are first transforming the data and then loading it into the final warehouse, in contrast with ELT tools(Extract Load Transform) which first transfers the raw data into the warehouse and then prepares the information for after-transformation uses. Have more than one transformation processes running on the same database? No worries! You can schedule the  ETL jobs like batch processes!!When do we need ETL?Let's take an example for better understanding. Suppose you have an online order processing system which processes the orders that customers place at you eCommerce. The system stores the order even after they are shipped (with the status ""completed""). But this might clog your database with a humongous amount of  old orders. You might want to move those completed orders for better management, data mining and analysis to a new system which contains just those orders.So, to consolidate the historical data from all disparate sources, you set up an ETL system, which transforms the data from the smaller databases into the more meaningful long-term databases. Based on the complexity of your working environment, you can pick up a suitable ETL tool for your purpose, or lo and behold, you can even build one of your own using a suitable programming language! Speaking of complexity, how exactly to we know how complex is our environment? Define how many source systems we have feeding our ETL system. Next define what kind of transformation is required in your data and how difficult it to employ this transformation to fit the existing data into the target system. Lastly, design a feedback loop to constantly check for errors and discrepancies in our ETL system. There you go! You now have your own Extract, Transform and Load! extract, transform, load (ETL)",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"I am not going to go ahead and tell you that when you thought that gaga dress on that girl the other day was crazy and when you wondered ""Ugh! What was she thinking?!"", you were totally a bitch to have judged her. I know, I know! It is politically correct to say that we do not know what a person has gone through in life, before we start judging them. But judging at first glance is a reflex for everyone! You are bound to have a first thought when you see someone for the first time, right? It is sometimes fine and totally human to judge. People do it all the time. Sometimes we are aware of it. Sometimes we are not. And it's not just the looks, you see! We have been judging people based on their etiquette, their mannerisms, their way of life! Even their actions! We are social animals, and this is the way we have been programmed to react to the bullshit around us. Now, the definition of what bullshit is may be different for different individuals. Anyway, the point here is, that we all judge. Somewhere, sometime, someway. And judging is not bullying unless you form an prejudice out of it and start discriminating based on those skewed one-person perspectives. Having an opinion is not wrong.

Samidha-Paroha,"I worked at IBM as an Extreme Blue Intern during May-Jul 2015. I wrote a blogpost sharing my experiences at IBM in the IBM Jobs Blog. You can check out the full post here : Extreme Blue: My Tech Whiz“Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn”The aptness of this adage has always intrigued me. And so has the relevance it has held during my internship at IBM. I remember being introduced to my project on the very first day. It was about Hybrid Cloud Computing. I was apprehensive at first, like every newbie, about the project, about the work culture and about the laissez-faire outlook there is for internships elsewhere. Ever since that day, the entire journey has been like a game of poker to me. There have been moments of indecisiveness, and shreds of fear when a deadline could not be met, and there have been cheers of success and those of accomplishments.As a twenty-something, I’ve probably done more than my fair share of internships in my college vacations. And aiding my appetite for variety, they’ve run the gamut from Functional Programming to Big Data, from an iPhone application to Data Analytics. Cloud computing was different yet. This was going to be my first hands-on experience at it, but thanks to my awesome mentors and the well-structured project, I never went astray in my work. Do you know why? Because liking the work that you do is more important than being good at it. Because if you like something, you eventually get good at it. But, forgive me as I burst the bubble for you, it does not hold true the other way round. And yes, this is the heart and soul of any good internship, a work place where you always feel like there is scope to improve, and to thrive.This reminds me of what I have particularly liked about IBM, I have been rather amazed at the unprecedented efforts IBM has put in fashioning innovative solutions for the entire virtual information world. Breaking a disruptive technology into any marketplace is risky and challenging. And IBM remains unparalleled at it. I have been awestruck in my two months here at the humongous list of patents and products that IBM has to its name. And the computer science kid in me feels kind of enthralled at being a teeny-tiny part of a big innovation en-route to a technocrat world. Guess what! That’s the best part! You not only get to come up with novel ideas, but you also learn how to sell them, which is pivotal to the promotion of any kind of product. Yayy!Okay enough of the geeky stuff, let’s talk about something fun! Did I tell you what a fantastic group of interns we are?! It feels like we have known each other since long before working at IBM. Now that the Extreme Blue internship is coming to a close, we sure have a lot of stories to tell along with funny pictures of each other that have been captured on the way. *Winks*Like this one here-Or maybe this one?Oh, what an adventurous ride it has been! I will miss this geek party and all the laughter I shared with my IBM buddies. *sob sob*",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Since India is an agro-based economy, its development lies at the hands of its villages. However, contrary to what most people think, there are certain exemplary examples which justify that living in these modern-day villages isn't such a bad idea after all! Have a look : Mawlynnong : This small village located in Meghalaya was awarded to be Asia's Cleanest Village by the Discover India Magazine! And if we go by the tourists' words, the entire village roads are devoid of cigarette stubs or plastic bags. Chappar : This village in Haryana happens to have a lady Sarpanch. Now you may wonder how does a female Sarpanch work in a place like Haryana where the sex ratio is infamously skewed. But Neelam, the Sarpanch, is no ordinary lady. She had set her life's aim to guarantee equal rights for women in her community and she has succeeded to a great extent, thanks to her endless efforts. The females of the village no longer have to wear the ghunghats, and also the birth of any newborn is celebrated with sweets, regardless of their gender.Pothanikkad : This village was the first in the country to achieve a 100% literacy rate. Unsurprisingly, this village is located in Kerala, the state which is known for its high literacy rate. The village embodies several primary, high and private schools which are renowned to be of city-standards. Wonder how many people the village has educated so far? As far as the 2001 consensus is concerned, the village consists of 17563 people, and guess what? That's the answer to our question!Bekkinakeri : Fed up of open defecation in villages? Adopt this tactic developed by the people from Bekkinakeri, a village located in Karnataka. Frustrated from open defecation, the council of this village requested people avoid doing so. But of course, that didn't work out well. So, the villagers adopted a novel strategy of going to the popular defecation points and greeting the people with a ""Good Morning"" when they came to defecate. Too embarrassed to go after that, the people entirely stopped defecating openly, giving the village a better hygienic outlook. The village later won a nattional award from maintaining village hygiene, the ""Nirmal Gram Puruskar"". Today, every household has a toilet of their own and a tap which runs at least 1-2 hours a day. That is clearly a breakthrough.",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"This is actually the most difficult shot to play if one is playing on the standard English pool table, since the cue ball is slightly smaller compared to the height of cushions of the pool table. So when the ball is cushioned, a very small part of the ball is sticking up. Thus we actually have a very thin margin to hit it. This causes the cue stick to skid on top of the cue ball which is considered a foul.Thus a good way to handle cushion shots is to raise the level of the stick using our hand as shown(I call it a hand-bridge or a hand-stand to rest the stick while making the shot), and angle the stick corresponding to the type of shot that we want to make. Make sure to apply some chalk powder on the cue tip and some regular powder on your hand where the cue stick is resting (this is to make sure it doesn't skid on your hand). Since the ball is cushioned, we can safely assume we cannot play a center shot and a bottom shot. So the options that we have are - top shot(follow shot), a jump shot or a masse shot(perpendicular shot). 1. Top Shot/ Follow shotIf the cue ball has top spin on it, it will resume rolling forward after making contact dead-on with the object ball and ""follow"" the object ball rather than stopping abruptly.Top spin is imparted to a ball by hitting it above the midpoint of its vertical plane as it faces the shooter.2. Jump Shot A jump shot is a shot in which the cue ball is made to leave the surface of the table after being hit by the cue stick.To execute a legal jump shot, the cue ball must be struck above the cue ball center line with the cue stick at an angle between 30 - 60 degrees. The angle determines the trajectory of the cue ball flight as summarized by the illustration below.It isn't really easy to play this shot, according to my personal experience, because it requires a lot of precision and practice to play it correctly and to avoid the cue stick to skid over the cue ball.3. Masse shotThis requires the highest level of proficiency. The masse', for those unfamiliar with the term, is a technique that causes the cue ball to follow a curved path. A massé is performed by hitting the cue ball with the butt of the cue stick elevated; usually by 60 degrees or more.Now we are good to go. It took me about  month and a half to learn to play this shot without committing a foul. I still face problems playing a masse shot and even a jump shot. But everything is easy once we learn the basics. And it's all just science. :)",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Remember this guy from the movie Ice Age (2002)?He is a crossover of a rat and a squirrel, called Scrat! He poses a wonderful example of a glutton who is ready to risk his life for that nut he is holding in the picture. Sadly, he always ends up losing it and is showcased in several movies like ""Ice Age"", ""Gone Nutty"", ""No Time For Nuts"" and ""Surviving Sid"" , chasing the nut up to the brink of being struck by lighteningor being chased by avalanchesor ending up being frozen for 2000 years  or being squished after being stomped on by the masses .Well, humans are not very different. We are gluttons for our feelings. Our nut is the thing/person we love, or the frustration or anger or ego that we hold on to. We go far out on the limb for our nut, but we always lose it in the end. We keep clinging on to it and end up hurting ourselves just like the Scrat. Now that you have got my point, let's try to figure out what can be done to avoid being a Scrat! The Scrat has an addiction to the nut. You see, we always need an addiction to get over another one! This may sound funny, but you need another engaging addiction (possibly a dynamic one) to get over your previous obsessiveness. I, for instance, picked up Quora when I felt the need to pick one for myself! Whenever I felt bad, I wrote. Whenever I felt the need to pour my heart out, I wrote. And trust me, that turned out to be the most productive and engaging addiction I have ever had! So, pick up another addiction, not the one with drugs or alcohol, but something that you'll be proud of later. Turn the tables in your favour and let those needy and clingy moments define your way into a shiny future where you'll not be ashamed to admit about your past, and instead you'll mark it as one of the defining moments in your life when you picked up a wonderful talent, that you probably never knew you had, and nurtured your knack for it. An extremely pivotal argument to this theory would be that you will NEVER forget the memories of your past. NEVER! But what you'll learn is to accept them and move forward with them! After all, nobody can get you that memory stick thing from MIB to erase your memory.  There is no such thing in real life, buddy! You simply have to accept having to live like the way you do and to cope with all those charging moments from the past or the present or those anticipations and anxieties from the future!

And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right: ""Once more into the breach, dear friends."" But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, and watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. I'd ask you about love, you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable. Known someone that could level you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on Earth just for you. Who could rescue you from the depths of Hell. And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel, to have that love for her, be there forever, through anything, through cancer. And you wouldn't know about sleeping sittin' up in the hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes that the terms ""visiting hours"" don't apply to you.

But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than man...for precisely the same reason.”- Douglas AdamsHappiness is the most misconceived notion ever. People associate happiness to their unfulfilled desires. I wrote about the same concept in my Blog a few weeks ago, and I would quote some of the salient points here.The core of our being is to be happy. Our conscious and subconscious efforts are always towards being content. Yet none around us is truly happy or content. Why? Because the notion of happiness has always been associated with attaining something, materialistic or non-materialistic. Nobody realizes that the continuous quest for happiness is what keeps them from being happy! Ironic right? People don't seem to realize that sometimes the awareness of not being in any quest of life is what causes happiness. The craving of water for a thirsty man, is what makes him restless and dissatisfied with what he already has. Attachment or desire of water is what makes him oblivious to the lows of life. ""I hope everybody could get rich and famous and will have everything they ever dreamed of, so they will know that its not the answer."" - Jim CarreyWe have the innate drive to find our likes, to find what makes us elated with joy, failing to see that this attachment will lead us nowhere. No fetters exist for him who neither likes nor dislikes.From attachment arises grief; from attachment arises fear.There is no grief for one who is free from attachment.Whence, then, can there come fear?

Samidha-Paroha,"TLDR : Interning at eBay was an awesome experience. The work culture is good and the projects are intriguing too. Few downsides are repetitive work and no policy of full-time job offers to two month interns.Long Answer : I interned at eBay India this summer. I was posted in Bangalore and the internship lasted for roughly 9 weeks. We were a batch of 11 undergraduates all pursuing a two month intern (including the interns from PayPal, which is now a part of eBay). Pros 1. Awesome work culture : eBay has a wonderful and welcoming work culture. People are really warm and environment is very much adaptable for a newbie. I was the only girl intern in our interns' batch of 11 but that was never an issue, thanks to the pleasant working space. We had interns' day out and interns' only games and activities. There were foosball, TT and pool tables in the office as well as Xbox for entertainment. The colleagues were fun to hang out with even outside of work. We had our own intra-eBay cricket tournament and I played in it :D (though I wasn't very good at it :P)2. Project was interesting : I worked on a project about building a Predictive Model based on Machine Learning and Data Analytics. I had a fabulous team to guide me towards the goal and the topic itself was intriguing to work on. I got a hands-on experience with the real world data eBay has and build something that would create a direct impact on the company.3. Perks and benefits : The compensation at eBay is comparatively very good. We got relocation benefits at the beginning of the internship and onward airfare. There were free beers and breezers every alternate week and free snacks and cold-drinks for hungry coders. Cons1. Development is purely based on your team : Work and scope of improvement are very much dependent on which we one is in. That is not a very healthy sign for apprentices. 2. Work tends to get repetitive after a while : For an intern of two months, a project could seem intriguing and novel in a way, but for an intern of longer duration, it would get repetitive and seemingly boring. Some innovation here could do wonders.3. No PPO for 2-month interns : This is very big con for someone expecting a full-time job offer at the end of the internship. None among us were offered a PPO. -----That being said, my experience was amazingly good and I was kind of sad to leave in the end. I made some wonderful friends and got to learn a lot of new stuff.

What I suggest you to do - You're working a good software MNC for god's sake!! And you have a very decent pay. What do you worry about? There are people out there who'll die to get your job.

Your relationships aren't messed up, because you still have your family. Your CAT mock score is bad, so what? Can you not prepare better for it the next time? Is it so impossible? I know what it's like to face a bad result, I've faced lots of failures myself, but the key is not giving up! Right now you should be working day and night trying to change the bad score you got into a good one. The very first thing that you should do is to clear the debt.

Samidha-Paroha,"Embrace your failure. Only then you can overcome the disappointment associated with it. Last summer, I was going through the exact same situation. I had a deal, which was suddenly called off. It was a terrible blow. That was the lowest I have ever been. I had a hard time hiding my vulnerability from everyone near me, I feared they would start picking on me. So I acted. I learned to fake it. And I got good at it as the months passed.I was disappointed at first. How could I have failed? What did I miss? Where was I wrong? It took me several months to make peace with the fact that I hadn't indeed failed. I had only got a cruel and hard-earned life lesson. I understood that I had to keep myself busy, to stop my mind from wandering off to scary places. So, I picked up hobbies. I started writing, for instance. It was then that I embarked on my Quora adventure. Whenever I found myself relapsing into disappointment, I pulled myself out. I knew that only I could do it. I helped other people overcome their failures, so very quickly I forgot my own. I empathized with them, I taught them that whatever doesn't kill us, only makes us stronger. When I became someone else's support, I overcame my own fears. It felt shitty for a long time. Failure can easily piss off anyone. But it taught me what years of success couldn't. It taught me that if it weren't for darkness, people would never really know the importance of light. I understood that only after seeing the lows, we can truly appreciate what being high is like. I understood that life is a crazy roller coaster ride. And no roller coaster only goes up. Just when you think you are at the top, you'll be thrown into the girth and then back up again.

Samidha-Paroha,"Ah, the most common of all. Thanks for A2A anon. I remember having this discussion with a friend, where I mentioned to him that I have a habit of playing conversations over an over in my head countless times, probably sub-consiously hoping that I'll be able to direct them as per my wish in reality, which is obviously not plausible. You know what the problem with this kind of aberration is? If the conversation was hurtful to you one time in reality, you cause yourself the same pain each time you play it in your head. The other person hurt you only once, but you keep hurting yourself endlessly by escaping into the ordeal over and over again. This is running away from consious reality hoping that you'd be able to change it if you think differently about it. This is the bad kind of escapism. Yes, to my surprise, there are two kinds. The first is when you are addicted to the exquisite pain, and you want to be drawn into that agonizing imprisonment willingly. And the second is art. When you are lost in the world of fantasy. Like music or writing or painting or travelling or reading or anything that engages you so much that you do not notice when your friend steps into the the room and scares the shit out of you by startling you. This is the good kind of escapism. Being absorbed into art. Escapism is not nasty. Escapism just needs to be understood. It can lead you astray if you do not look properly. But it can also lead you to horizons that you may not have experienced before, only if you know how. It is like a treasure hunt. You may go awry if you pick the wrong clue or you may find a fortune cookie if you pick the right one. Just remember to pick the right one. You have a choice. If your life is a sphere and you are standing on top of it, you have a choice of escaping to the zenith or escaping to the nadir. You make that choice. It is always you who makes the choice.

On his way, he came across a small river, which he had to cross to get to his home. When crossing the bridge he looked down at the river.He saw his own image reflected back at him from the water current. But the dog thought it was another dog that was clutching another piece of bone in his mouth. The dog became greedy and wanted to grab that piece of bone too. And as soon as he opened his mouth to bark at him, the bone from his mouth fell into the water and was carried away by the water current. Greed brings loss. Desire is wanting something with all our heart. It is like a wish. Whereas, greed is desire gone out of control. Greed is wanting to possess more than one needs or deserves. The dog desired to have a piece of bone in the above story. So he got one. But when he saw another piece of bone, which he didn't even need in the first place, he became greedy and lost the piece of bone that he already had. Greed can never be satiated.

When he finally woke up and was ready to talk , he had tears in his eyes (I have never seen him cry except when my grandpa died) and he said to my mother , ""I am not going to leave you before I am sure you'll be okay after me"" . When he came out of the hospital, he started the work on our new house and designed the most beautiful home in the world :)When sometimes my mother thinks about that time, all she says is , ""Always find some time to tell the people you love, how much you love them , because once it is too late , you heart will always be filled with remorse. Happiness is not living in a fancy place with a lot of money or power, it is living with the ones you love even in a small crib. """,high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"I failed bad. As bad as it can get. I felt psychologically hampered. However, when I came out of it, I had grown as a person far more than I could ever anticipate. What I learned from it - I was the most impatient person you could possibly come across. I wanted things done at the blink of an eye. Failure taught me to believe in myself and wait patiently. It taught me to stop lamenting for the things that I don't have and start being grateful for the ones that I have. Things aren't as fair as you thought they'd be and you don't always get what you deserve. It taught me that the more you expect from life, the more disappointed you shall be. It taught me to stop giving a fuck about what people think about me! Biggest development possible.And finally, it made me realize that I am quite a fighter! I didn't lose the battle, in fact I won it fair and square. I had a new found respect for myself.One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it. - OogwayLife can only weigh you down when you let it. What if failure itself is the answer?

Samidha-Paroha,"Yes there is. Before we focus on what it is, let's have a look at some statistics that'll reveal you're not alone in this fear. Apparently, 3 out of 4 people or 75% of individuals are affected by speech anxiety. It also accounts for 19% and the largest majority of those suffering from some form of phobia out there. It's called Glossophobia, more commonly known as the Performance Anxiety.​Statistics say that women and men suffer equally from stage fright.I have been extensively involved in public speaking activities ever since I was a kid, but even after a decade, when I went up on the stage one day for a debate competition, I was drenched in cold sweat, all over my hands. This means, the fear had nothing to do with experience?! It was about the fear of performing good, which was irrespective of how many performances I had given in the past.Let's look at this in more detail. Long abandonment - Let's say I have been avoiding speaking in public for a long time now. Now when I eventually decide to go on stage, I'll be gripped by an anxiety of performance! What if people don't like me? What if I forget what I'm supposed to say? What if someone mocks me?Low self-esteem - If I seek complete approval from my audience, or I have low self-esteem because of some childhood traumatic incident, I might be low on confidence which causes me to commit mistakes which I did not expect to commit while practicing back at home!  High expectations - If I simply believe in perfecting everything, I'm bound to have really high expectations, which the practical side of me somehow knows will never get fulfilled. And this causes me to be anxious subconsciously. I anticipate failing my own expectations. Realization of unpreparedness - If I am not prepared well enough, I know it in my head, that I'm going to be terrible up on stage, and those girls I hate will giggle at me and those boys I had a fight with might laugh when I stammer. Fear grips, sure as hell.But stage fright is a very normal phenomena and it happens to everyone!! And not just for the first time they appear before an audience, but every time! May be a little lesser than the first time, but the fear never vanishes completely. Dianna Booher, a corporate speech consultant says,""If you hear someone say  he or she isn't nervous before a speech, you are talking either to a liar or a very boring speaker""But what matters is that, after each performance I still gear up for the next one, learning from the disasters of my previous performance and incorporating better ideas in my presentation.Cheers !Sources : Fear of Public Speaking Statistics Factsheet14 Fear of Public Speaking StatisticsHOW TO AVOID STAGE FRIGHT",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Thanks for A2A I once came across the Letter from Birmingham Jail written by Martin Luther King, Jr which he wrote while in jail at Birmingham. He was jailed for protesting against segregation in 1963. His letter was an open letter to the clergymen who were against his protest. I call this best in terms of the impact that it created back then. It was reprinted 50 times in 325 editions of 58 readers published between 1964 and 1966....I am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their ""thus saith the Lord"" far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco-Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.

Samidha-Paroha,"★★★★☆When I first saw the trailer of the movie, I had my doubts whether a spy movie could be funny. Little did I know that I was going to be running out of breath laughing my heart out. Yes! The movie will keep you splits until the very last scene. And just so you know, contrary to what you may expect, the movie is about a nuke bomb in a box! The main character is marvelously portrayed by Melissa McCarthy, who literally carries the movie on her broad shoulders, although every other character plays a highly integral part in the film too. For instance, Jason Statham. This man can make you laugh your ass off, while maintaining a completely straight face. Statham plays a self-proclaimed smartass agent who completes the movie. I guess he should try more of these comic roles :DThe plot is simple and yet keeps you waiting for the next punch. The mystery unwinds slowly throughout the movie and climaxes towards the end as the emerging hero Melissa takes the icing on the cake. Jude Law is also there in the movie, however I would say Statham and Melissa have much more significant characters in the show. Jude is a field CIA agent, and Melissa is a CIA agent who sits in a basement acting like the eyes and ears of Jude Law. Be prepared to watch guest appearances by Nargis Fakhri who has got one dialogue in the entire movie and in a very different role Rose Byrne. Also, expect a high concentration of F-words which is kind of obvious, Spy being a Paul Feig movie. Overall, I would recommend this movie as a must-watch :)",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"There is a Chinese adage which goes like this : ""If you must play, decide on three things beforehand, the rules of the game, the stakes and the quitting time!"" Contrary to the common myth, knowing when to quit is one of the most integral secrets of being a winner. No, really! You would be shocked to hear this. But think of life as a casino. If you don't set a bar on what you're going to gamble away, you might end up on the streets empty-handed, with nothing more to lose. It would be foolish to never give up then. Remember how Pandavas gambled away their wife in a gambling game and then lost her to be molested in public? For those who are unaware, this is a folklore in one the most famous Hindu epics, Mahabharata. Yes, you should draw a finish line for every race that you decide to enter. It is meaningless to just keep shooting arrows in the dark and expecting a result just because you have decided not to ""give up"".There is no cosmic mother who'll listen to your cries and would be swayed away into granting you all your wishes. I personally believe in quitting from a battle if I am guaranteed to lose it. And no, I don't believe that ""participating would teach me stuff"". It is utter bullshit. It is embarrassing enough to lose a battle, and participating just for the heck of it is just a waste of time and resources. I believed in not giving up a few years back. But when I look back now, sometimes I wish I had stopped and given up at a certain point. I could have saved so much. So, no, I don't believe in the theory of never giving up. It is moronic and dangerous at the same time. You could gamble away your life if you don't give up. Knowing just when to give up is the hack of life that we need to learn. And thus ""never giving up"" is not in my dictionary now.",high,mid,high,mid,low

Hence, Page was forced to change the name to Led Zeppelin.

Some of these have actually been world class, and deserve a comeback with considerable modernization. However, now that the youth of India is obsessed with their love of American sitcoms, it's more difficult than ever to set foot on Indian territory. Yes yes, all of us know that the American sitcoms clearly over-weigh the currently-aired dull and melodramatic soaps, that we have all watched by the way, with our grandmas or aunts at some point of time. No one can deny that. But there's more to the story that just this one obvious reason. Stuck bad : We can relate more to Raj Koothrapalli from Big Bang than Simar from Sasural Simar ka. I mean c'mon Simar, just get done with your marriage already! The television industry in India is still stuck at reincarnations and immortality and poojas and all-time parties. And that's not it. The industry won't budge because they earn from the batshit crazy tv soaps enough to run their living. I mean, if you're getting two square meals, why make art? Why not just marry another bahu to torture half the nation. Obvious thrills : Isn't it annoying when someone gives away a spoiler from GOT before you have watched it? Nope, not the same with Indian television. They just show their entire storyline in their trailers. And honestly, sometimes the extravagant background music will cue you about who's going to die next, if at all, because supposedly people live for 150 years on a average on Indian television. Giving away these immortal lifestyles would be seemingly difficult for the Indian soap-viewers, don't you think? Bollywood creeps in : As if watching the crass Bollywood numbers in the movies wasn't enough, they have invaded our television sets too. And guess what? Our middle-aged audience loves it when the cauldron of goodness, our heroine, takes a bullet on her forehead to save our hero and still has 20 minute time before death to bid each member of the caste a teary goodbye. Are you kidding me? -_-Failed copy attempts : Pity your brains. Because let alone making novel sitcoms, our industry cannot even copy American ones thoughtfully. You remember ‘The Suite Life Of Karan and Kabir’ and ‘Karishma ka Karishma’? Well, good that I don't. That said, we have seen a new trend in the marketplace with TVF making short online-only shows like TVF Pitchers and Permanent Roommates. I personally loved both of them, and I guess most of the youth appreciated the highly relatable characters on the shows.

Samidha-Paroha,"Almost everybody will tell you JSON is easier to use and implement than XML. When JSON was ""discovered"", as Douglas Crockford puts it, XML could not bear the tremendous onslaught and almost caved out of the industry. But on what parameters do we exactly judge which is better? Read and judge for yourself. Syntax : Here JSON is clearly ahead of XML. Its syntax being simpler, it becomes friendlier to implement. Thanks to the start and end tags in XML (Duh!) , if we compare the size down to byte code, JSON can be written using fewer characters.  For instance,  in JSON we can simply define an object asmyJSON = {""age"" : 22,                       ""name"" : ""Samidha""} Here our parser need not be intelligent enough to determine whether age is an integer or string. While, the XML syntax goes by the tag system. So we would have to write the same piece of information like this - <person>          <age>22</age>      <name>Samidha</name></person>Weight : I wasn't even going to use this parameter for comparison, because after JSON and XML content is gzipped, the difference in their weight, when put on the wire for transmission, is not much. But if you wish to go into details, here it is. Compressed JSON will give you slightly lighter weight than compressed XML (Obviously the difference will be huge in standard JSON and XML). Querying : Need access to some particular information in a nested data structure? You'll be stuck with JSON in this case, because you need to know the exact location of the content in order to retrieve it. In XML, you can use XPath/XQuery to look up the location of some content even in deeply nested data structures. There is no such interface in JSON. Format Transformations : Say you have data in a particular format and need your output to be in some other format. XML provides an interface called XSLT that can be run on the original XML file to obtain the file of some other desired format, for  instance HTML, text file, or even JSON for that matter. No such built-in tool present for JSON, so data is pretty much stuck in one format. I will essentially skip the security factor with the eval() parsing of the JSON objects into Javascript, assuming that we are talking about lightweight content. However if complex data structures are in question where retrieving data is an integral part, then XML would prove to be of much better utility. So in conclusion, both have their own pros and cons and choice between the two should be made based on suitable scenarios. PS : I'm novice too, so feel free to correct me! :)",high,mid,high,mid,low

Samidha-Paroha,"It is gaining recognition lately, although it has been in use for more than a couple of decades. Some major features which have been successful in luring programmers to this new paradigm are - OOP shortcomings - People want change. OOP is highly messed up. Data is bundled up with functions, functions are dependent on each other, parallel programming concept is out of scope. Sometimes, it becomes impossible to figure out the bug in the code. But wait, we do have a solution to simplify your fucked up code!Inherent concurrency - Functional Programming is different from imperative object oriented languages in a way that it induces parallelism in a very subtle and smart way. The order of execution of functions in the program is not significant which makes multi-processing machines more executable and relevant. Ease of conversion from mathematical functions - Functions in functional languages relate closely to mathematical functions, which make conversion from mathematical functions to program code easier. Still, functional programming is yet to be accepted in its full form. Higher level abstraction - As programming has evolved from assembly language to functional programming, we have increasingly relied on abstraction as our key attribute for various software models. Abstraction has made its way into our priority list, when it comes to deciding which language to pick for applications today.    Assembly Language->C(imperative)->Java(OOP)->Functional ParadigmMore readable code - Again, distribution of code into minuscule modules that operate independently and concurrently gives more transparency to the code and hence makes it easier to read and apprehend.",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Thanks for asking. I am sorry to hear about your friend's loss. The death of someone close is one of life’s most difficult experiences. Since you are in different cities, there are a few feasible things that can be done. Allow her to grieve for a while: First things first, she has undergone a terrible loss. Let her take all the time she needs to grieve. The more you loved someone, the more time you need to grieve after they are gone. It will take some time for the fact to sink in her head. She might even need more time than other people because she witnessed everything so closely. Realize that without grieving she'll not recover from her loss. If you keep pushing her to stop crying, she'll pretend to be normal, when in fact, she'll be grieving alone. Listen to her: Call her and insist her to talk. Let her speak her heart out. The more she speaks, the lesser time she'll need to accept the truth. Understand that she could behave differently during this period, she could be agitated or fragile at the same time. Be patient. Be on her side whenever she's vulnerable. If needed, talk to her on a video call, that'll comfort her more. Remind her constantly that people are there for her and be as compassionate as you can.Get her moving: After a few days, start persuading her to join a gym or start running or play badminton. Anything that'll help shift her focus. If you have some friends in her city, ask them to take her out. If she likes to read, gift her some extremely engaging books that'll divert her mind. Do not leave her alone: NEVER leave a depressed person alone. And don't say anything that reminds her of her friend. She's already trying hard to get acquainted with the reality, do not press on her. That'll only make it worse. But if she wants to discuss something, ask her to go forward. If she's not at her parents', ask her to go spend some time with her parents or family or friends, or whoever she feels close to. Do not offer pep talks: Do not tell her, ""your friend wouldn't want you to feel sad all of the time."" or ""you've got to cheer up"", remember that we cannot rescue someone who's lost a loved one. Only they can rescue themselves. If you say this, it'll make them feel guilty for grieving. Make sure there are no repercussions on her health: This is the most important point. Now that she's depressed, she might not be eating properly or sleeping properly. Ask her constantly if she had lunch or dinner, she needs a good sleep each night to calm her mind. Trauma affects our health, she's not in a state to take care of herself. You have to manage that. Since you are in a different city, ask someone who's around her to do the same.Death is not something we like to even talk about. And she's lost her friend to the same. It might take a lot of effort to overcome the loss. But time heals. Ensure that she doesn't feel isolated.

However, this question urged me to look beyond my backyard and research on how people across the world like their cuppa tea served. China : I think it is only fair to begin with the home of the famous tea-discoverer Shennong, who happened to discover tea when a leaf fell on the kettle of water he was boiling. Chinese tea is much more than just tea. It is used in traditional Chinese cuisine! And not to forget, in medicines as well. Serving tea is a sign of respect and drinking tea is a sign of morality and social status. The value of tea is so much in Chinese culture, that a newly wed couple kneel in front of their elders and serve them tea as a symbol of their gratitude towards them! Aint it fascinating? Never thought of tea that way :) Russia : Quite contrary to what people might expect, Russian culture has a rich history of tea. Tea is served at the end of the meal, with a serving of dessert. Brewing is done using Samovar. Taiwan : The famous Taiwanese tea, Oolong tea, is considered the ""champagne of teas"". It is served in small cups and the same Oolong leaves that are used can be brewed several times. Effective use of tea, uh? Argentina : Thinking about socializing in South America? Go serve Yerba mate (mah-tay) in groups. It is a green tea full of vitamins, exemplifying a smoky flavour with an earthy appearance, served neatly in small containers. People like socializing over a cup of tea, even if they don't like the taste of it. Qatar : In Qatar, people like Karak-Chai, meaning strong tea, and quite literally, they boil the tea leaves twice to give it a stronger flavour. True to their words, Qataris. Egypt : Never underestimate tea-drinking in Egypt. They like to have their Karkadeh tea served either hot or cold.

Samidha-Paroha,"Madhya Pradesh, also known as the heart of India, draws tourists every year with its immense cultural history and well-preserved national parks, which offer the best wildlife spotting opportunities in India. Forts and palaces are scattered all over the state and are a huge attraction to external tourists. Here are some of the top must-visit places of MP - 1. Khajuraho TemplesThis is a place where religion is married to eroticism. Erotic fantasies are sculpted in stone in the temples facades. The sculptures keep changing their hues with the pace of sun in a day.The place is one of the biggest tourist attractions in Madhya Pradesh for external tourists. 2. Kanha National ParkGuess what!! The picturesque Kanha National Park was the inspiration behind Rudyard Kipling's unforgettable classic Jungle Book! There are numerous Tiger reserves in India, that are preserving these ferocious tigers, but nowhere can you see them as often, and as regularly as in Kanha National Park. Kanha is also famous for its black bucks, which have been known for their depictions in paintings and sculptures since the beginning of civilization.3. Bhedaghat / Dhuandhar FallsBhedaghat is a very small town near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, but is very big draw for tourists because of its beautiful scenic beauty where a river is cutting through a white marble gorge. It has been featured in some famous movies, such as Aśoka (2001 film). Dhuandhar falls are another major attraction of this place.4. UjjainRam Ghat in Ujjain is famous for its Kumbhmela. Ujjain is considered the Greenwich of India due to the fact that the first meridian of longitude passes through it. Ujjain is also known for its temples such as Mahakaleshwara.5. Sanchi StupaSanchi is located around 52kms from Bhopal in MP. The Stupa at Sanchi is one the most wonderful structures of ancient India. It has been included by the UNESCO as one of the heritage sites of the world. The Buddhist Temples in Sanchi were built to commemorate the teachings of the Lord Buddha.6. ManduThere are very few places in India which are still immersed in the romance of the old ages. Mandu is one such jewel with a rocky hilly plateau littered with ruins of tombs, palaces and forts. Time seems to have stood still here. One can sit and cherish the ages gone by, and leave all the worldly worries behind.  Madhya Pradesh bagged the Best Tourism State Award in 2012. Here is a short depiction of various colours of Madhya Pradesh and its eternally beautiful cultural heritage. :)",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Thoughts meander like a Restless wind inside a letter boxThey tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.Feeling low can be inevitable and is a very valid emotion according to me. And when we are feeling low, our head is flooded with irrational or sometimes intense thoughts that obscure our vision. To free myself from this bondage, I force myself to do one of the following things.I write.When I'm depressed, my mind is like a volcano erupting with thoughts that need to be penned down. And the volcano quiets down only after the lava has spread all over my newly fabricated articles. Every incident in my memory, every face in my surroundings and every voice in my head is a fabric waiting to be intertwined into a story.The beauty of this exercise is that when I'm done, I have the most soulful piece of writing I have ever written. Each time. I pore my heart out in the piece. I write not for a readership but for myself, as a vent for my over-brimming thoughts. It helps me organize my mind and sail my boat through a tsunami of endless dark thoughts. It is a depiction of all my instincts accumulated on a piece of paper. I've written some of my most unfeigned and intense articles when I was depressed. I feel much more calm and happy about myself after writing. And it's the most constructive use of my potentially destructive mood swing.Hugs (Jaadu ki Jhappi)When we hug someone, oxytocin is released into our bodies by our pituitary gland, lowering both our heart rates and our cortisol levels. Cortisol is the hormone responsible for stress, high blood pressure, and heart disease.-SourceHugging cures depression, induces sleep and is highly rejuvenating. It is an instant solution to almost all the worldly problems you might face.

Samidha-Paroha,"No. Forgiving is one of the most courageous things I have known. And trust me, it is NOT easy. How much you can take and still keep moving forward, reflects your magnanimity. Revenge is so NOT the answer. If you try to harm them in a similar way, you are no different than them. Let me explain this to you with a story. In Indian mythology, Brahma's son was Bhrigu. Once Bhrigu got inquisitive to know who is the greatest among his father, Vishnu and Shiva. Bhrigu started his examination with his father. He went up to him in a haughty way without bowing(which was customary in Indian mythological tales), to which Brahma said, “What! You are coming into my room haughtily? How disrespectful of you?!"" . Bhrigu thought to himself, ""My father cannot be the greatest of the three"" .He then went to Shiva. Shiva was unclean and was wearing filthy clothes. In spite of this, Shiva embraced Bhrigu as he came towards him, to which Bhrigu protested, ""Why did you hug me? You're dirty and filthy. Now you've made me dirty too!"". Shiva felt humiliated, ""Go away you disrespectful person."". Bhrigu left hastily. He thought, Shiva cannot be the greatest since he hasn't conquered his anger yet, how will he attain spiritual greatness without it? He finally decided to go to Vishnu, but found that he was sleeping in his chambers. He decided to infuriate him to see if he reacts in a similar way. So, while Vishnu was still asleep, Bhrigu kicked him hard on his chest. Vishnu got up startled and quickly grabbed Bhrigu's feet. He then said, ""Are you hurt, my child? Are your feet alright? You kicked me hard on the chest. My chest is strong but your feet could get hurt while kicking so hard.""Bhrigu was deeply touched by Vishnu's forgiveness. There is a shloka in Sanskrit saying, Kshma badan ko chahiye, chhotan ko utpatKa Raheem Hari ko ghatyo, jo Bhrigu mari laat. (Translation: Forgiveness is the trait of the great, only juvenile resort to trouble-making; what did Vishnu lose as Bhrigu kicked him?)So, by forgiving you are actually empathizing with the sinner. You lost nothing as they humiliated you. But something must be wrong with them that caused them to behave inhumanely. The least we can do is forgive and empathize. You not forgiving them will not stop them from doing what they are doing. But if you empathize with them, they might realize they are wrong. You make the decision.Image source : How to Express Empathy - Avoid the Traps! - Catalyst - Agile & Culture",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"Because the audience does not watch the movies with a grain of salt, they watch it with a bucket of popcorn. In our movie industry, a picture doesn't speak a thousand words, but a picture definitely sings a thousand songs. The storyline is clearly cliched and usually based on the ""love owns all"" theme. The falling in love part is incomplete without an overly-cheesy song in the rain. A gunned down hero survives miraculously only to sprint up and kill the villain. And a nail-biting audience enjoys every second of this ridiculous and unrealistic portrayal.The poor or the realistic class of audience doesn't exist in India for movie-makers. They make it for the upper-middle class people who would rather enjoy a couple hours of witless humor than an hour of mind-numbing thriller. Money. They make money from such movies. Look at all the recent 200 crore films. I've seen better movies at college-level movie-making competitions.

Samidha-Paroha,"No.A crime as heinous as rape cannot be judged on whether 2 people have suffered annually from it or 30. The crime is as traumatic to someone when they are one of the 2 victims, as it is when they are among the 30 victims. You cannot judge someone's excruciating life experience on the basis of some numbers.Now let's come to your comparison with different countries(which sorry to say is a very shallow reasoning on such a grave subject). I believe that because India has been a highly patriarchal society for a long long time, the victim continues to get molested by the society even years after the rape, it eventually turns out to be the victim's fault causing them a lifetime of suffering for no apparent reason. So, in your terms, this is why it gets ""overrated"" in India, much more than in other countries, because some part of the Indian society is still a hypocrite towards rape victims. They still look down upon the victim. This is the reason some victims don't even come forward to file a complaint in certain backward areas, fearing an alienation from the so-called society. In India, they go through a lot more than sexual abuse.Finally, to the student mentioned in your question description, who described all Indians as rapists, I would like to say - If we go by your theory of generalization and if you belong to Singapore, we can safely describe all Singaporeans as morons.

Samidha-Paroha,"They've made some oppressive rules in the country, and they've started calling it ""culture"".I wasn't personally shocked at the way people reacted to the video. India has been well known to be hypocritical when it comes to showing off the so-called rich ""culture"" of the country where women get brutally raped every other day in the capital of the country and people turn a blind eye. Even more so, girls are told to cover their bodies to save themselves from the savages running free on the streets, because it'll be ""their fault"" if they get raped in a public bus or taxi.Our country is one where people are forced to follow the culture. Hindu Mahasabha's dictum of forcing couples to marry each other if seen in public on Valentine's Day is way more offensive and tyrannous. And they keep saying we live in a democracy. Do we really? Doesn't feel like it. I am perplexed at how calling someone a mother-fucker in front of 4000 people is taken as offensive by some person who was not even present in the show and who wasn't even mentioned during the entire length of the event.The show had so many disclaimers warning the viewers to NOT watch it if they get offended easily. It is offensive, which is why it is a Roast. I mean c'mon, that's the whole point of it. We live in a country where ministers are caught watching porn in the middle of a parliamentary session, which is being held at our expenses, and surprisingly, no one gets offended. Okay, so is this part of our culture now?The biggest irony of the whole controversy is that, the person who got offended by the jokes on the show, tweeted a statement that put all offending comments on the show to shame! If you got offended by what was being said in the show, why did you ironically tweet something that was equally, or even more nastily offending? Aren't you a part of the gang now?I expect that followers of Hindu Mahasabha will shower adverse comments on the answer, which is their personal opinion and they are more than welcome to express it as an answer to the question just like I did, however any nasty comments here shall not be entertained.",high,mid,high,mid,low
Samidha-Paroha,"O best among men [Arjuna], the person who is not disturbed by happiness and distress and is steady in both is certainly eligible for liberationGita does not  comment on which life a wise man leads, it comments on how he reacts to it. So, I'll go with the red one. The only thing that I'll change is my response to the highs and lows of the red one. Which liberation are we talking about? We are caught in a vicious cycle of  moh of the living or the dead. The happiness and sorrow arise from the same. Spiritual liberation is attained from rising above the bondage of our material existence, by refusing to be a slave to our minds. So, go out there and live your life, just don't fall prey to crests and troughs that you encounter while you are at it. The one who is not aggrieved in sorrow, and who is not ecstatic with material opulence is the one who is dangerously close to being liberated. So, the green line denotes not the state of our mind, but our response to an extreme emotion. We cannot control what we feel, but we can certainly control how we react to what we feel.

Samidha-Paroha,"Thanks for A2ALooks are very subjective and changeable. One who is ""undesirable"" to someone may be extremely attractive to another. There might be days when you don't feel confident enough about your own looks and there might be days when you feel like you could defeat Brad Pitt. To add to all the difficulty, the timing of your looks might not be right.So, it is all contextual and cannot be defined as a single answer. As for what makes a man undesirable, I would not say it is the looks, but low self-confidencemale chauvinismImmaturityUndesirability does not necessarily signify bad looks. In fact, looks have little to do with it.

I have a feeling you have mistaken introverts to be people who speak less and who are shy.

Samidha-Paroha,"Thanks for A2A Vasubandhu MankeYes a lot of people have. What mattered was their work after they had entered the field, and not before.The first perfect example that came to my mind when I first read the question was Bernard Lovell. I read his book ""Astronomer by Chance"" when I was in 9th grade, in which he mentions how a chance event led him to become one of the pioneers in the field of radio astronomy. His love for electric arcs intrigued him to build a telescope and the rest is history.Here's an excerpt from the book. A chance event in 1939 changed the young Bernard Lovell's life and led him to become one of the pioneers of radio astronomy. From an idea that radar used for detecting enemy aircraft might have larger potential, he developed a telescope capable of investigating the distant regions of the universe. His famous telescopes at Jodrell Bank have played a critical role in the discovery of unknown objects in the universe and led to questions that lie at the heart of contemporary astronomy and astrophysics. ​My second example would be that of Sylvester Stallone . The lower left side of his face is paralyzed – an accident which has given Stallone his snarling look that he is famous for and his slightly slurred speech. Stallone had his first starring role in the soft core pornography feature film The Party at Kitty and Stud's (1970). He was paid $200 for two days' work. Stallone later explained that he had done the film out of desperation after being evicted from his apartment and finding himself homeless for several days.

I learned this quite recently through a form of meditation called zazen(seated meditation) in Zen Buddhism. Note the difference between Mind Full and Mindful though.How did it change my perception?Mindfulness taught me to be aware of the procession of my life experiences, moment-by-moment, as they happen, without being judgmental and without evaluating the could-have(s) and the would-have(s). Sometimes we live our lives in an auto-pilot mode, without taking life's control in our own hands, only partially aware of what's going on. Zazen made me switch off the auto-pilot mode and take charge. Mindfulness made me happier. Billiards was my way of meditating!! Novels could be another option!! Seated meditation is just one option, there are hundred others. That's the good part. Research has shown that Mindfulness in a business context can be extremely productive. Increases in mindfulness are generally associated with increased creativity as well as decreased burnout. See? It is spilling into areas beyond psychology and health. In short, if you find yourself stuck by judgments or by cognitive biases, let them slide out of your mind through mindfulness. Life will be a lot easier.Image source",high,mid,high,mid,low

Samidha-Paroha,"This answer is in honor of all the beautiful ladies out there.Gandhi once said : ""Woman is the companion of man, gifted with equal mental capacity, if by strength is meant moral power, then woman is immeasurably man's superior, if non-violence is the law of our being, the future is with women.""He had a point. International Women's Day is celebrated annually on 8th March in many countries to pay tribute to all the past achievements and struggles of women and more importantly, to encourage the untapped potential and opportunities which remain hidden beneath patriarchy.So, where did it all start?Timeline 28th Feb, 1909 : This day was marked as the first observance of International Women's Day by the Socialist Party of America in honor of the 1908 garment workers' strike in New York, where several rallies were led by women protesters against working conditions in the factories.Aug, 1910 : In an International Women's Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, German Socialist Luise Zietz suggested that a day be marked as a tribute to all the hardships and struggles of women around the world.19th Mar,1911 : The very next year, over a million people signed in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland to mark 19th March as the IWD. They demanded an equal right to vote for women, right against discrimination in jobs, economic and educational rights.1913-1914 : The IWD also became a medium for women to protest WW1, when Russian women started rallying and henceforth observed their first IWD on the last Sunday of February, 1913. In 1914, IWD was held on March 8 because it was a Sunday. Note that, no protest or strike took place on March 8.1917 : Against the backdrop pf WW1, Russian women again chose to protest on the last Sunday of February which fell on March 8 on the Gregorian calendar. From its official adoption in Russia following the Soviet Revolution in 1917 the holiday was predominantly celebrated in communist and socialist countries. It was celebrated by the communists in China from 1922, and by Spanish communists from 1936. After the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the state council proclaimed on December 23 that March 8 would be made an official holiday with women in China given a half-day off.In the West, International Women's Day was first observed as a popular event after 1977 when the United Nations General Assembly invited member states to proclaim March 8 as the UN Day for women's rights and world peace.Every year UN has a theme annotated for women's rights and the theme for 2014 is Equality for Women is Progress for All.Helen Reddy wrote a song called ""I am woman"" on the struggles of being a woman in 1971.

Samidha-Paroha,"Ah, a question that has haunted many self-proclaimed geeks for years! Let me burst the bubble for you. Thanks for the A2A.TLDR : NO! It is a myth, a false claim. How else do I say it? Just, NO! And yeah, not to forget, NO!​Long Answer : Before we begin our analysis, let's try to look into the dictionary meaning of geek : ɡiːk/informalan unfashionable or socially inept person.a knowledgeable and obsessive enthusiast.""a computer geek""There you go! Assuming that you were referring to the obsessive enthusiast interpretation of the word, your question now translates to : Is it necessary for a an unfashionable or socially inept person who is also a knowledgeable and obsessive enthusiast to score good marks in all examinations? ​Okay, referring to the above Venn diagram, we infer that geeks may be socially inept and emotionally unstable, but look! They are intelligent and obsessed (hopefully in the right direction) too!! So there is a teeny-tiny possibility that they could perform well in all the examinations. But we still don't have enough proof, do we? Funny thing, since its origination, the word has gone from an insult to a badge of honor, worn proudly by many. Your question thus brings a very old societal stereotype into the foreground. Now let's dig a little deeper and look at the cultural perception of the geeky world.The Geek Syndrome : Assume that X is a labelled geek. But X is a gaming-obsessed geek and not at all studious. X has brilliant cognitive processes and multitasking skills. And X is also obsessed with gaming, so X is both intelligent (knowledgeable in gaming) and obsessed (again, in gaming) . Now X appears for a Math exam at school. But sadly, X did not study for the Math test properly because he was busy gaming (X's mom thought he was studying, while he was secretly playing video games) at home. So, X got 5 out of 20 in the Math test, and then he gets grounded, which he loves because he can now play video games all day while he is grounded. Bummer :-/ Now, the society snatches away the ""geek"" title from X and gives it to Y who in turn scored 20 on 20 in the Math test. This doesn't bother X, because he is too busy gaming. You see the difference? X and Y were both geeks, but in different domains. But, only Y got a proper recognition for his work, and X just got grounded for performing badly at something he didn't even like!!Societal stereotypes : In most families, a child's score card at school/college is the sole measure for judging his/her potential in life. Societies in general (especially in India) are generally not accepting of failures in their children, especially not when that failure concerns their academics. ​Coming back to your question, if you consider all the X's from our example, I am sure you would understand that different people find themselves fitted into different and a huge variety of domains. They might all be geeks in their respective arenas, but might know less in some examination that they are appearing for. It is just a matter of interest and being-at-the-right-place-at-the-right-time. ​PS :  'Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.' — Albert EinsteinMoral of the story : we should verify our parameters of judging someone, before we judge them.

Bhaskar-Bagchi,"Miss Aditi has already jotted down the pros and cons of all kinds of berths and I could relate with each of them. Here is an additional note:If you are travelling alone on a long route(I usually travel between Allahabad and Kharagpur which is nearly 15 hours), upper berth will be be best! Get up and settle down, get ready with your laptop or book. Switches are at an arms distance, charging your laptop/mobile is easy. Sleep as long as you as you want. Nobody is going to disturb you. Once in a while you may want to get down and stretch your legs.Avoid upper berth by the door. I have hurt myself several times trying to get down when someone accidentally opens the door.If it is a day journey nothing can beat the side-lower. You enjoy all the views, reach all the vendors, get down at every station and keep track of your luggage.Never ever, ever ever, ever ever take a middle berth if you are travelling alone, it's a trap!!! This image shows my friend's futile effort to be comfortable at the middle berth.If you are travelling in a group, group of friends of a family trip, avoid taking the side berths. Try getting all your seats in the same compartment. I remember my trip from Bombay to Kharagpur. We had 6 seats in a compartment and 2 side-uppers a few compartments away. We never used those side uppers. We pulled the curtains and there we had our own personal space, our room. We watched movies, played games and what not. Middle berth can be interesting at times. I think my friend Yash, who is second from the right in the following image agrees with me:)Lower berth can be very useful when you are travelling with family. All day you can sit together chatting, enjoying food and the view. If you have old people or ladies in saris, it is specially recommended to have at least one lower berth.All that being said, you may also enjoy some time travelling on the foot-board, on the door. Nothing feels better than the cold breeze directly on the face, view of the country side and the taste of speed.

Yesterday a friend asked me if I could save the IRCTC ticket as a pdf and I said yes, to which he replied awesome. Was it merely good or really awesome? Awesome has now replaced words like great, delicious, thank you. Today we have awesome movie, awesome sauce, awesome lecture.The Cambridge Dictionary defines awesome as ""Causing feeling of great admiration, respect or fear"" [awesome definition, meaning - what is awesome in the British English Dictionary & Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online] With that in mind, was the sandwich you had in your canteen the other day awesome? What respect or fear did it cause? That could have been delicious, but awesome? I am not convinced. We are taking away the power of the very word.There is no dynamic, no highs or lows if everything is awesome. Please remember everything is not awesome. Here are a few things that are really awesome:We had to carry everything on our backs and walk for miles, the invention of wheel was indeed awesome.Neil Armstrong landing on the moon, no doubt awesome.You can capture every moment, the invention of photography was awesome. Taking selfies and photoshopping images is not awesome.Let's give the word it's power back and use it sensibly, that would really be awesome.Credits: Jill Shargaa, Please, please, please.

Bhaskar-Bagchi,"“There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.” ― Ernest HemingwayThanks for considering me for answering. I've never written a book, but I liked writing short stories. I am really not sure about what should I answer but here are a few suggestions.The first thing that I think I should say after reading the question details is that don't worry if you have never written any book earlier, every renowned author began at this stage. It is the idea that matters. And if you believe you idea is brilliant I think you are already half way through it. Not being related to any form of art and literature doesn't matter much. I will give you a couple of examples. First is Chetan Bhagat. I know there has been a lot of criticism about his novels/pieces, but does that really stop him from writing? Nope. As a matter of fact I think he writes well. I am not a critic, but my point of view is that his target is the Indian youth, the people of our age group, and he is quite famous in that audience. That is how I see him as a successful writer from a non-literature background. Have you heard Palash Sen of the Euphoria band singing? He is my favorite. He is a doctor by qualification. There are thousands of such examples where people have excelled in the field which they didn't start with. If you do anything by passion you can excel in it.Now let's focus on the publishing part. Although it should be a secondary concern, but it is important too. Before you actually go to a publisher or release an online copy, complete your book(which you will surely do), proof-read it thoroughly and then distribute a some copies to few of you friends and get some reviews. You will know if your audience is happy with the content and if not, where to modify. Revising and rewriting is a key to successful writing. After repeating this for a couple of times, I think you will be ready to finally publish it.These were some general tips I would suggest as a non-writer and non-publisher. Now if you want to get a few tips from writers on how to write better, you should try reading ""Becoming a writer"" by Dorothea Brande. This is an old book and nicely briefs the points that should be taken care yo improve writing. You should also read Ellen Vrana's answer to How can I improve my writing skills? I hope it helps and wish you luck for your writing. Cheers!!",mid,high,mid,low,mid
Bhaskar-Bagchi,"C++ is vast, really vast! If one wants to gulp the whole of it, he might choke. If you are interested only for competitive programming, only a  few things will suffice. I've tried to list them down:The basic input/output. Many programmers use fast input/output to decrease the input/output overhead and avoid TLE.STL is one thing that is very useful to increase coding speed and get rid of writing each and every implementation. If you can get easy with the complete template library, it is great, but again  STL in itself if very big, so learning the most common of those should do as an amateur.Get used to the STL containers, specially vector, stack, queue, set.Each of these containers have special properties as per the data-structure they are implemented for. Sometimes questions become very easy if you recognize the data structure which is being asked for.Use of hash-map and std::map can be very usefulThe implementation of basic algorithms can be found in algorithm.hTemplate classes are not necessary for competitive programming.Basic string handling can be very useful.Get familiar with iterators. Try using forall instead of the conventional for loop.Get a good hold of pointers and structures.Understand the use of macros. If you see the code of any pro-coder who participates regularly you will notice first 50 lines of includes and #define's They have templates of their own which helps them code faster without typing every crap.Some easy tricks like pass-by-reference can sometimes do miracles.Bit operations and bit handling can also be useful.Apart from the language you also need to hone your basic mathematics skills and stress more on logical thinking and algorithms.All the best with your coding!!

Bhaskar-Bagchi,"I feel that logic is an integral part of memory. Any logic needs to be stored in memory. Talking about the general sense of logic, what you talk about in the question detail, logic can be viewed as a set of rules. We use different logic in different situations, every situation has to be dealt with a particular rule. Even talking about mathematical formalization, logic can be thought of as a Finite State Machine and even to store an FSM we need some constant amount of memory. So I would say yes we need memory to be a logical person. I am not sure if we need logic to have a good memory, but as I sense from your question, if you are referring to the people who study logically and remember more, I would view it as remembering some basic rules and then building on them new rules i.e. derivation of new rules from existing ones. It is pretty much similar to logic based formal proof systems used in Artificial Intelligence systems where we have a small knowledge base and we build rules from them to proof a query.Coming to the second part of your question, it's sad that in many domains purely memory based questions are given importance while examining someone, but then there are many other systems too, even in India, which give a necessary importance to both logic and memory.Whatever I wrote was mostly what I feel about the topic. But there are many psychological scientists who spend their life studying memory. Interesting facts have come out. Our memory tend to create new facts too. That proves to be very dangerous sometimes. Here is an interesting TED talk in false memory. They don't talk about any relation between memory and logic but they do tell how we create our own version of memory.",mid,high,mid,low,mid
Bhaskar-Bagchi,"In one word ""NO"". I prepared for an year to crack JEE and here I am, enjoying my final semester with a job in my hand. I've many friends who dropped and are placed without any trouble. It is not necessary that you crack the engineering entrance examinations in first go. Some people don't have enough preparations, for others it's bad luck. But after an unsuccessful first attempt many people are skeptical to go for an year drop. But I take it differently, I take it as an opportunity to correct the mistakes I made in my first attempt. Even the companies understand this and may be because of the same reason I've not seen any company judging students for recruitment based on whether they cleared the entrance in first attempt or second. They only see your current technical skills, your problem solving capability which tells them whether you are suitable for them to hire and your curricular and co-curricular achievements, in the order they are listed.But being said that there are a couple of things I think should be addressed here:There are many options other than job immediately after B.Tech. After you enter college you need to explore various options, higher studies being one of the most promising option. A decade back job was a secondary concern and most of the students were worried about grades, scholarships and LOR's for applications for higher studies, but the trend is weathering away. Another path is that of entrepreneurship. You need to have guts for this. You need to forget what the world thinks and pursue you passion, build new idea and have a spirit to conquer the world. There are many others options to be explored, and fortunately none of them ask you if you joined a year late.Taking a year drop is a crucial decision and if you decide to avail this opportunity, make the year worth it. I've seen friends who initially decided to take a drop and by the mid of the year were hopeless and lost their interest in studies. This should never happen. It is very important to keep yourself motivated throughout the year and prove to yourself that since you took the drop you are better that what you were an year ago.",mid,high,mid,low,mid
Bhaskar-Bagchi,"Thanks for A2AI was brought up in a ""not so big"" town. (I don't call it small, because it was not small by the standards then.) In the school, I was the topper of my class(which means a lot when you are a child) but was still considered to be the second best student of the school. There was this guy, lets call him Ramu, who was one year senior to me, and was the one because of whom I was the second best. Ask him to write him an essay on a white A4 sheet and you won't be able to tell whether it was hand-written or printed. He was more handsome than I was and I still am. Although he was my senior we were compared on many aspects like who was better in G.K. He most of the times his team won gold in intra-school quiz whereas I had to be contented with my silver. I was in JRCC(Junior Red Cross Circle), he was in JRCC. I was in Interact(Child club to Rotary club) club, he was in Interact club.Things went pretty much the same way until in 2005 when the Rotary club of our district got an invitation for RYLA(Rotary Youth Leadership Award) Only six students under that club were supposed to go. Ramu was one of them for sure. I also wanted to go. Without creating a fuss 6 students were selected from our school, and I was one of the(because I was the second best in the school :P) The program was 7 days long and all the participants were supposed to stay in the campus of the school for those 7 days. It was the first time I was away from home, among strangers, making new friends, exploring the outside world without parents' protection. I was enjoying it. It was one of the best times I have ever had. In those 7 days I learnt many lessons of life and met many great people. Those debates, dramas, trekking and disco every night, I still remember them vividly and not to forget I still have the slam book I with sweet words from all my RYLA friends.On the last day, I had a feeling of containment. But during the closing ceremony, something unexpected happened. They(the organizers) declared that they had been observing all of us all this time and had selected among us a best boy participant and a best girl participant. I felt bad, if I had known earlier that something like this is to be announced, I would have worked harder. But as I didn't know, nobody else knew. So I didn't think of it much. As the closing ceremony approached to end, they were about to declare the best participants. Me, Ramu and the other 4 from my school were sitting together. We were guessing some names, the most active ones and scanning every face to check the anxiety in people when the announcement called Bhaskar Bagchi. I was in cloud nine. Nobody(at least me and my group) expect that this guy, who is writing this answer would be declared The Best Boy Participant in The SAARC Centennial RYLA 2005. It meant a lot to me. While being all natural and all myself, I proved to be better than all 200 participants, more specially our best boy of the school. I didn't have any personal issues with the guy, rather I respect him a lot, but this was a great moral boost-up for me. I still remember on of his relative's remark on the result(this relative was our family friend) He said ""Actually Ramu is taller and looks a little matured whereas Bhaskar is still a child. May be that's why they chose him instead of Ramu."" I don't care what people say, I proved it. From that day I know ""Damn!!! I am the best"" :D",mid,high,mid,low,mid
Bhaskar-Bagchi,"2.2 People do many things, and as I read the answers each one of them appears to be very appealing, but yes everyone has a little secret, a little trick that gives them happiness. Here is mine. The one thing that makes big difference in my day is a 2.2 on my bicycle.For those who don't understand the premise, I am a student at IIT Kharagpur. We have a very big campus, some 2200 acers, very beautiful. The trees and greenery takes my breath away. Most of the important non-academic places in the campus that might interest the students are along a ring road, which also touches the academic complex, the main-building as we call it. This also includes most of the halls of residences, CCD, BR, Tikka, Veggies, Gymkhana, Swimming pool and many more. This ring road is 2.2 km long, and therefore gets its name 2.2Its beauty increases with the time of the day. After the working hours it is mostly used as a jogging track. After dinner friends hangout in groups, some couples are seen spending time with each other sharing the experiences of the day. Some people try things like skating and skeet boarding. Past midnight slowly and steadily the rush decreases. People usually return to their halls after the tiring day.Being an engineering student, it is not very abnormal for me to be awake till 2 a.m. At this time the 2.2 is most beautiful. Nearly nobody roaming around, street lights lighting the road, cold breeze and the silence. At this point of time I love to go for a 2.2 on my bicycle, all alone, some slow music in the earplugs and fresh air filling the lungs. All the pressure seems to vanish for a moment. Those 5-10 minutes removes all the worries and tensions. I suddenly forget all the worries and get some time to think about myself, how was the day, what went wrong and what went unexpectedly very well. I call this ""giving 5 minutes of the day to yourself"". In those 5 minutes nobody disturbs me. Many of my close friends know about this habit of mine. Some of them even call me tharki saying that I go out so that I can call someone and they don't know. Whatever they say, that doesn't matter. I love that part of the day(rather I should call it night.) That makes me ready for the next day. Sometimes I am afraid, after I pass out, where will I find this 2.2 again.",mid,high,mid,low,mid
Bhaskar-Bagchi,"A2AAs you already know practical implementation is the best way to learn, but since you insist me to suggest something apart from implementation, I would pick video.Let me take this opportunity to justify my choice. Text is always better if one wants to get in-depth knowledge of anything. Good textbooks, may that be of any subject, contains detailed information about the relevant topics. But if someone is not habituated to reading, textbooks can turn out to be monotonous and boring very soon. Next best choice is if you get a chance of learning from someone who is experienced and knows a lot about the subject. This is more like studying in a class where an experienced teacher teaches a subject. This can be achieved by both audio and video. But the problem with audio is that we are not completely involved in it. While listening to the video, you will check you facebook notification and whatsapp twice, will think of a cup of tea, look out of the window and find children playing and will do many other things. On the contrary if you are watching a video, or a video lecture, both your senses i.e. listening and and seeing, will have to be involved and you get lesser chance of being distracted. Thus, I feel, learning will be better with video compared to learning with audio.",mid,high,mid,low,mid
Bhaskar-Bagchi,"A2ASay you are a veteran of algorithms and want to share your knowledge and want to share your knowledge with the world. For the same you have decided to write a book on it. Now you have a road-map ready for it and since you are a very organized person, you pen down the idea, the road-map, the printing houses you will contact, people whom you would like to review and proof-read your book and everything else you need in the order you need.Now you actually sit down and start with writing the first chapter of your book, and slowly and steadily complete the book. Now you get it proof-read and start approaching the publishers.Here the first part, where you pend down your idea, road-map and steps is like writing the algorithm, and executing the actual plan, writing the book is like writing the computer program.Remember that in both the cases you were writing plane text on a piece of paper but they are not the same. Similarly algorithm is the idea of solution of a problem and computer program is writing the step by step execution of the idea. I know it is not a very good analogy, but this is the best I can think of to convey what I want to convey. There is a difference between algorithm and computer program and comparing them doesn't make much sense. Computer programs are step-by-step instruction, which on execution, will realize the solution in the way proposed by the algorithm.Hope I was able to convey what I wanted to.

Please ensure that you have done enough background work before emailing any professor. By background work I mean go through their list of publications and get a sense as to which sub-domain they are working on. Also try to read a few interesting publications and an icing on the cake would be to propose a problem statement by yourself or ask doubts from their publications ( if you have any ).

Aditya-Jain-14,"Not necessarily. The notion of decidability is a bit different from NP-Hardness and NP-Completeness.Loosely speaking, NP Complete problems are a subset of NP-hard problems.Lets get some definitions correct and then I shall give examples.NP-hard : A problem P is said to be NP hard if all problems in NP are reducible to P.NP-Complete : A problem P is said to be NP-Complete if :(i) all problems in NP are reducible to P i.e P is NP-hardand (ii) P lies in NPThus NP-Complete problems are the hardest problems that lie in NP.Problem P <-> Language LAny problem P can be converted into a decision problem whereby its inputs either get accepted or rejected. A language L is thus constructed out of the problem which contains all the inputs that get accepted. For example : Consider the problem of finding prime numbers. This can be framed as given a number 'p' find whether its prime or not. The language L will thus be a set of all prime numbers. Decidable : A problem L is said to be decidable if there exists an algorithm with accepts all the elements of L and rejects those which do not belong to L. Please note that time not a constraint when it comes to decidability. If one is able to write any algorithm that does the job, the problem will be decidable.Thus all problems that belong to NP are decidable. But NP hard does not imply decidabile always. In principle, all problems in NP can be reduced to Halting Problem which can be classified as both NP-hard and undecidable.Thus to sum up :1. NP complete = NP hard + problem lies in NP2. NP hard problems may or may not lie in NP3. Decidability does not depend on the time complexity.4. NP-hard implies neither decidable nor undecidable.Examples :1. NP-Hard, decidable but not NP-CompleteThe language of True quantified Boolean formula is decidable in polynomial space, but not Non-deterministic polynomial time. Thus it is a good example since it lies beyond NP, is decidable and NP-hard too.2. NP-Hard, decidable and also NP-CompleteThis basically boils down to a NP-Complete problem which is decidable. Hence all NP-Complete problems are examples since all of them are decidable.",high,mid,low,low,low
Aditya-Jain-14,"As other answers have suggested, I would also suggest going for a good  bat at once.

Aditya-Jain-14,"Kolmogorov complexity and Shannon entropy are very different although they appear to be somewhat similar.Wikipedia defines Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, to be a measure of the computability resources needed to specify the object. Kolmogorov complexity in concrete terms is the minimum piece of code/program that one can write to generate a particular string. The basic difference between Kolmogorov complexity(KC) and Shannon entropy(SE) is that KC is concerned with the content of information whereas SE is concerned with the missing information. I""ll illustrate this point with a few examples :1. Suppose there is a match going on between Team A and Team B with possible results being win or loss only. Alice is watching the match whereas Bob does not have access to it but however knows about the teams involved and other essential details. Now, the randomness associated with such an event is captured by Shannon entropy. It says that such an event has randomness equivalent to 1 bit. Alice can safely use 1 bit to convey the result of the match(the missing information). Its called missing information because Bob had all the information regarding the match except the result which was the outcome of a random event.2. Now suppose Alice wants to store a piece of string say ""11110000"". Few possible ways of storing the same are :(i) ""11110000"" using 8 characters(ii) ""1*40*4"" using lesser number of charactersOr any other way from which it can be retrieved back. The minimal of these possibilities in terms of size is what is known as KC. Important point to note is that KC is associated with the whole of information content.Thus KC and SE have diverse applications in their respective domains, some of which include data compression and communication respectively.",high,mid,low,low,low
Aditya-Jain-14,"Not really to be honest! Quantum mechanics is flexible in the manner in which you want to learn it. People belonging to different domains (Physics, Chemistry, Computing, etc) learn quantum mechanics in a way thats helpful for them and easy to apply in their respective domains.For example : Physicists worry about schrodinger equation, differential equations, types of solutions to these equations, properties associated with molecules, etc. However, when it comes to computing the same things undergo certain changes. The operators which were represented as complex looking algebraic function now turn into nice looking matrices and termed as gates. The notations change from integrals to a different type known as Bra–ket notation. We are no longer worried about solving differential equations and their solutions. Rather we are worried about how a given state, which nothing but a column vector or matrix in the more generalised scenario (Density matrix), changes on application of operators (which are again matrices). To sum it up, one only needs to know the basic postulates of Quantum mechanics but does not need to worry about the intricate details associated with them. However, it is always an advantage if one has a basic understanding of quantum mechanics from a physicists point of view as it helps in appreciating the beauty of nature and providing a holistic view of the subject.

Aditya-Jain-14,"You give that kid an incentive. Lets say he goes to school one fine day with you. You give him the names of 15 teachers and their room numbers and tell him/her that one among these has a bag of chocolates for him/her. He just has to find which one and he will get all the chocolates.Scenario 1 :The kid is patient and clever and decides to do the job alone so that he has all chocolates to himself. So he goes  to each of the teachers one by one and asks them for chocolates. Eventually succeeds in some amount of time.Scenario 2 :The kid is really impatient and craving for chocolates with his mouth watering. So he decides to get hold of 15 other friends and tells each of them to visit a particular teacher and return to commonly agreed fixed point with the chocolates if any of them gets them. He stands at the fixed point waiting for them. As soon as one of his friends succeeds, he gets the chocolates.So here is the conclusion : Scenario 1 is what we call a deterministic algorithm where one proceeds sequentially whereas the second scenario is non-deterministic since one tries out all possibilities at once using extra power of ""non-determinism"" (friends in this case).PS : The incentive is in bold everywhere in the answer.Assumptions :1.

If one is able to write any algorithm that does the job, the problem will be decidable.Thus all problems that belong to NP are decidable. But NP hard does not imply decidabile always. In principle, all problems in NP can be reduced to Halting Problem which can be classified as both NP-hard and undecidable.Thus to sum up :1. NP complete = NP hard + problem lies in NP2. NP hard problems may or may not lie in NP3. Decidability does not depend on the time complexity.4. NP-hard implies neither decidable nor undecidable.",high,mid,low,low,low
Aditya-Jain-14,Life varies greatly from person to person and there is no single definition which fits for all. For most of us its a race. A race in which one gets up with a set of tasks to be done all throughout the day and ends with more tasks in hand for the next day. For some its a race to fill their stomach with two meals a day. For some it can be summed up with a smile on the face of their loved ones. For some its a party night at the pub. For some its pulling up a tattered blanket on a winter night by the roadside. For some its an unhappy one with millions into the account. While some happy with a meal with the family. http://thefearlessheart.org/its-not-so-easy-to-be-rich/For some its fighting at the border while others snoring all night peacefully.For some its a dream to achieve and transform the world.

Aditya-Jain-14,"One way in which information is interpreted in Information Theory is Entropy. Entropy in simple terms is directly related to randomness/ uncertainty associated with any system. More the entropy more the uncertainty. Wikipedia gives two definitions of Entropy (information theory) :1. Entropy is the average amount of information contained in each message received.2. Entropy is a measure of unpredictability of information content.Both these definitions are equivalent. Let me demonstrate this with a few examples :Let us consider someone I tell the following three statements to you  :1. Sun will rise in East tomorrow.2. It has been proven that humans can fly.3. Since the weather is cloudy it might rain today.Now ranking these in terms of uncertianty : 2 > 3 > 1The second definition states that you will get most information out of second statement, followed by third and lastly first. This is simply because first is a well known universal fact i.e totally predictable whereas the second in highly unpredictable.The first definition captures the quantitative aspect of the information that you receive. There are many types of entropies which try to quantify information in different ways. One common measure is Shannon's Entropy.

Ram-Baheti-1,"Back in the day India wasn't considered a good side away from home. They were always the underdogs in an away series. We had developed the notion that India cannot win overseas. Even a draw by the Indian side was considered to be a victory back home. Some people weren't very fond of this. Some of them wanted this to change. 1 person took the charge. Saurav Ganguly he was called. The Prince of Kolkata,  The Bengal Tiger, the Warrior Prince- DADA.When He debuted, back in 1992, he was so arrogant tht he said that he wasn't on the team to be a waterboy. But who knew that this arrogance was to take India to glory in the decade to follow. He got a playing chance in 1996 tour of England and made his debut at the Lord's. He played a scintillating 141runs knock and stamped his arrival to the world of cricket.Dada was an aggressive batsman. He used to play with such ease and find so many runs on the off side that he was mentioned as Rahul Dravid as""Next To God on Off Side"". Not only he was classy on the off side but he used to hit a lot many sixes on the on side too. He used to dance sown the pitch to spinners and tharsh them over the mid wicket and long on. Pleasure to watch and enjoy. When Sachin Tendulkar decided to give up captaincy, it was handed over to Dada. Who would've known that this lad was to hike up mountains in the followings. Dada was always an aggressive captain. And he didn't hesitate to take unconventional and unorthodox methods TO WIN. Yes for Dada it was foremost that he won the game. He captained India to the finals of ICC Knockout Cup in 1999, final of 2003 world cup. But more importantly, he revived the spirit in Indian Test cricket. Giving a fight till the end, playing aggressively whatsoever be the conditions, and backing youngsters to rise up on occasions were the peculiar traits of Dada's captaincy. Then there came a time where he thought that the then coach of India was meddling with things not to be right. Dada was striked out of the team because of the ongoing controversy. But that didn't mean it ended up nicely. He is a warrior . He came back to the side almost a year later just to show how much he still has to give to the Indian cricket. Among all the retiring legends of India, Dada holds the highest average. And that itself is an achievement when compared to Tendulkar, Dravid, Gavaskar, Laxman. It's not because of nothing that one guy could change the face of Indian cricket overseas unless his name spells Saurav Ganguly. The victories in England, Australia, Pakistan; those against SA, WI in home are all testimony to his brilliance in captaincy. But it doesn't end there. Dada was in the side of the KkR in IpL, Though he couldn't do very well in the three seasons there he was the top run getter for then in 1 season. In season 4 he was picked by Pune Warriors, where he didn't have a very good season but his celebration on the wicket of Kevin Pietersen.There will be better players. There will be better captains. And there may be better leaders. But there will never be a Dada again.​",mid,low,high,mid,low
Ram-Baheti-1,"I face the same problem with my best buddy. He constantly keeps arguing that Rohit Sharma is a better player in the side.I only put out a few points. Kohli is the one who can score runs at any pace and in any situation(Australia, New Zealand, West Indies, South Africa, and of course the subcontinent). He comes in to bat either when we lose an early wicket or when the openers have scored runs freely. In both of these circumstances there is pressure. In the former its understood but in the latter, not to let the runrate drop and score without taking too many balls to get set.He has more or less no injuries whatsoever. He has been in the side when there was Tendulkar and Sehwag and Gambhir dominating the attacks all over the world. He has been there when these greats were replaced. And unlike any other player in the side from then and now, he has been a better match winner. Stats prove this too.He is now the captain of the Indian test side, which in itself shows the belief that the seniors have instilled in him. He is always aggressive and energetic on the field. He brings a flair to the pitch like no one else. When all the players fail against the greatest of bowlers, he smacks them round the park- be it Saeed Ajmal, Malinga, Dale Steyn or Narine. And the numbers part, that shows the great stature of this player at this young age. Second fastest to 5000 runs. Most centuries in chasing and winning. Centuries in India, Australia, South Africa, West Indies, New Zealand. Highest T20 average till date. And above all, the belief of a nation of a billion people.

Ayush-Verma-4,"Dear R**** It’s been 2 years  now since we’ve ended.  You’ve been in my dreams a lot the last few months, though you only made your first appearance just as long ago. It’s slowly getting easier to go on without you, but it’s taken a very long time to get to this point. It hasn’t been without it’s fair share of pains and losses. I no longer speak to a lot of people. No longer consider them friends. No longer want them in my life. There is so much I could say, as I have a history of vocalizing my thoughts, but I will refrain from lengthy diatribe, as it no longer suits me. Sometimes I delete unsent texts and mails in my ‘draft’ folder. Because I know they would be useless knowing the distance between us. It hurts how when anything good happens you are the first person I want to tell and the first person I wish to be there to share it with. I lost my best friend. Dating sucks, it sucks going through the phases with someone, now that I’ve had you in my life I have this picture of what my ideal partner should be like, and in my head I’m really painting a picture of you. Some nights I spend crying or I just can’t sleep because I just replay everything through my head. I guess it depends what mood I’m in, when I think about you and get angry on myself, or if I’m happy and I really want you there, I think about what it would be like if you were there with me and how much greater it would be. I take one of the greatest lessons I’ve learned from our failed relationship and I share it with everyone. When we first met, I liked you. As time went on, I began to love you and I saw so much more than just the outside of you.  I loved who you were and how you treated me. It shatters me down inside that  you don’t value me now. I miss having someone who is able to deal with all of my moods, who can handle how sassy and stubborn I am. It is very hard to get someone to the point where they love you for all of who you really are, it’s hard opening up to that point, it’s because you’ve taken this long (or short) journey together to get to this point of comfort and trust and love, and then it just all goes away. I never did understand that, when you love someone and you break up, where does the love go?  You’re surprised with what you get and how all of that truly doesn’t matter, at the end of the day you love the person that makes you smile for unknown reasons, you love the person that makes you feel worth more than you ever imagined you could be worth, you love the person that you know at the end of the day it doesn’t matter if you are bald, fat, stupid, you mess up, you know that person won’t look at you any differently than before, you love the person that makes you feel good to be you… You were that person. I  believe that there is one person that you are more compatible with than anyone else, but I don’t believe I could find that person. But I did find you, and I believe that if one single moment in my life was different, that I wouldn’t have found you. You were my best friend, you were that one person I wished to be around my whole life. Unfortunately you didn’t feel the same way now. sometimes you don’t get to makes all the decisions in your life, and you must deal with the cards you’ve been dealt because you are not always the dealer. So I would like you to know that I am getting better but I do have moments that I fall. Sometimes I torture myself by looking at our photos and going through our stuff. But I don’t wish hell upon you and I do wish you the best, even though it’s not with me. I hope  you are taking care of yourself .Always remember this one last thing, even though I might not still be with you, I don’t think I could ever stop loving you.Yours Ever and Forever…",mid,mid,mid,mid,mid
Ayush-Verma-4,"In a 1951 in a test versus England, Alex Moir of New Zealand bowled 2 successive overs, the last before tea and the first after the interval! The only other time this happened in test cricket was in an Ashes test in 1921. Only two test matches have ever been tied - the first between West Indies and Australia at Brisbane in 1960-61 and the second between Australia and India in Madras in 1986-87. The smallest margin of victory is 1 run when the West Indies beat Australia at Adelaide in the 4th test of the 1992-93 series. West Indies went on to win the 5th and final test and won the series 2-1.The second day of the Lord's test match between England and West Indies in 2000 is the only time in the history of test cricket that a part of all 4 innings have been played on the same day.On the 1974 tour to England, Indian opener, Sudhir Naik was accused of stealing a pair of socks from Marks & Spencers.In February 2009 England and West Indies played the shortest ever test match. Only ten balls were bowled before the match was then called off due to an unsafe outfield.Mario Zagallo of Brazil won the football world cup both as a player and as coach. Geoff Marsh has achieved the same feat in cricket, winning in 1987 as a player and in 1999 as coachEarly bowlers would bowl the ball underarm - and cricket records tell stories of great underarm lob bowlers. Overarm bowling was initially illegal. It was introduced to cricket by a Kent cricketer, John Willes. He actually learnt it from his sister, Christina Willes who found her skirt was getting in the way when she tried to bowl underarm!The first laws of cricket were written in 1774. Since then they have been changed on numerous occasions. Pretty much everything has changed since then. The early cricket bats were long curved pieces of wood resembling a thick hockey stick. The stumps consisted of two wickets and one bail in between. The only law of the game that has remained constant is the length of the pitch at 22 yards.Speaking of the stumps, initially the afore-mentioned shepherds would bat in-front of a tree stump, hence the term 'stumps'. As the game progressed it was at times played in front of a wicket-gate - which led to the term 'wickets'.In 1868 an Englishman called Charles Lawrence based in Australia put together a team of aborigines and took them to England. This was the first ever Australian tour to England, and each player wore a cap of a different colour so that the spectators could identify them. The team played 47 matches against a number of local teams of which they won 14, lost 14 and drew the rest. Apart from playing cricket the aborigines showcased a number of unique sports including the backwards race, boomerang throwing and cricket ball dodging.Sir Len Hutton is the only man to be given out Obstructing the Field in test cricket.In 1876-77 the English cricket team toured Australia. It is believed that the cricket tour was organized to replace a cancelled tour by Charles Dickens to Australia!The match that is now recognized as the first official test match was played between Australia and England in Melbourne, March 15th - 19th 1877. Australia won by 45 runs. 100 years later many of the great English and Australian cricket legends descended upon Melbourne to watch the Centenary test match between Australia and England. After a remarkable match Australia beat England by 45 runs - the exact same margin by which they had won the inaugural match 100 years earlierCharles Bannerman of Australia set a number of records in that match. He faced the first ball in test cricket, scored the first run, the first four and the first century. He scored 165 not out in Australia's 245 all out. Of all the records he set in that match one record still holds - his 165 constituted 67.34% of Australia's total (245) - the highest percentage by a batsman in a completed test innings.The longest test match of all was played between England and South Africa at Durban in 1938-39. This was a timeless test which lasted for 9 days, despite which the match ended in a draw since the England players had to leave to catch the boat back to England! Set 696 runs to win in the fourth innings they had reached an astonishing 654/5 and had a real chance of winning the match when they had to leave.Only thrice in the history of test cricket has a team come back from following on to win a test match. Strangely enough Australia has been at the receiving end on all three occasions. At the SCG in 1894-95 Australia lost by 10 runs, having scored 586 in the first innings (the highest score by a losing team) and asking England to follow-on. The second time it happened was at Headingley in 1981 when an inspired Ian Botham and a devastating Bob Willis helped England win by 18 runs. The last occasion was in 2000-01 at Calcutta when a VVS Laxman master-class helped by Rahul Dravid and Harbhajan Singh helped India win by an amazing 171 runs after following on.At an individual level, 1982 Duleep Mendis of Sri Lanka scored 105 in both innings against India. He is the only batsman to hit identical hundreds in both innings of a test match.Makhaya Ntini is the first black man to play test cricket for South Africa. Henry Olonga was the first black Zimbabwean test cricketer.The first one-day international was held between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971. Actually the first four days of a test match had been rained out, so on the final day the first ever one-day international was organized. Australia won the match.Geoff Boycott faced the first ball in one-day cricket - not exactly the most dashing of batsmen! Graham McKenzie was the bowler.No one has ever scored 4 successive one-day centuries. Herschelle Gibbs scored 3 successive centuries, and was on 97* when South Africa needed 4 to win. Alok Kapali bowled a wide which went for 4, and Gibbs was denied the record by the tiniest of margins!Sourav Ganguly is the only cricketer to have won four successive Man of the Match awards in One-day Internationals.",mid,mid,mid,mid,mid

Ayush-Verma-4,"Lust at first sight,  YES. Chemistry within minutes of meeting someone,   SURE. But knowing and feeling love instantly?  SORRY, NOT BUYING IT.In today's heady world of Smartphones and Texting and Tweeting, we might very well fool ourselves into believing that instant gratification can also apply to matters of the heart. What does it mean to be in love or to love someone in the romantic sense? It sounds simple, but I think to love someone is to really know that person. But when we throw the term around so liberally, especially before really knowing someone, we ultimately dilute its meaning - what it actually means to accept someone's heart and to give that person yours, fully. We also set up wildly unrealistic expectations for anyone looking for love, as if love has to be something that is experienced immediately.It took time for me to learn these lessons:Love isn't about being swept off your feet, quickly winning someone over, feeling that elusive-yet-perfect lightning bolt from the very first meeting or feeling emotionally off-balance.The seedlings of love begin when you let someone in the door.Love only flourishes when you allow that person to come inside and stay awhile.It takes time to develop trust, vulnerability and real intimacy. It's not just about the good times and laughs, it's about loving someone despite their idiosyncrasies.It's also about feeling a sense of peace, comfort and emotional safety with someone.    These things take time to develop.",mid,mid,mid,mid,mid
Ayush-Verma-4,"After reading books by Indian writers, I understood, I should give more value to the story they are telling than their writing skill itself. An example is Amish's ""The Immortals of Meluha"", while his grammar and writing style suck, his story is immensely captivating, and I found I could actually ignore his bad writing style and enjoy the novel.Chetan Bhagat stories don't have any value added at the end of the day, they ""don't end with a moral"" is one way of putting it. Neither are they entertaining nor enlightening .I personally think he has written a school essay that has got publicity because an IItian has written such a ""readable book"". He lacks penmanship, language is local and good enough for those who hardly read but like to say they do- so citing his books makes you a reader. A book when it makes you think, imagine, helps you visualize, makes you search for more information, learn new words, structure of sentences enriches your vocabulary- when these are incorporated into an author's writing, then he can be called an author, else let's leave him as a writer- as even a child who begins to write its ABC is also a writer. Let's not compare him to author's as there is no comparison at all! He is certainly in a class of his own- the junior class, and the publishing houses get to publish his book cheap, given that people don't read and they don't mind reading trash, for now.

Other users will be able to contact you on  iMessage using this email address.Apple’s iMessage system is a model of convenience when connecting between iPhones. But trying to leave the ecosystem is the very definition of horror.The Internet is filled with tales of frustration from those who have traded in their iPhone for an Android phone only to find their text messages trapped within Apple’s cloud. The issue arises when an iPhone customer trades in his or her phone for, say, a Galaxy S5, but keeps the same phone number that Apple’s messaging system recognizes as an iPhone.A recent server glitch made the problem worse, rendering moot one of Apple’s key methods for trying to remedy the issue.The iMessage problem is now the subject of legal action by a California woman seeking class-action status for a suit against Apple. She charges that Apple’s message-grabbing ways are depriving former customers of the ability to get full value from their wireless service after they give up their iPhone. The suit, filed last week, claims Apple’s actions violate California’s unfair competition law and also interfere with a wireless carrier’s abilities to deliver its promised service to consumers.Apple declined to comment on the litigation. It is, however, well aware of the challenges customers have faced when seeking to exit the iMessage universe.The issue dates back to 2011, when iMessage was introduced with Apple’s iOS 5 smartphone operating system.iMessage relies on Apple’s messaging system to intercept a text message sent to another iOS device and re-routes it through its servers rather than sending it via the wireless carriers as a standard SMS or MMS message.The benefits of iMessage include bypassing a wireless carrier’s text messaging charges, enabling the ability to tell when a message is read or delivered and to send a message simultaneously to all of one’s iOS and Mac devices. However, Apple’s system has proved problematic in that in order to work properly, it needs to have an accurate knowledge of which phone numbers are actually associated with iPhones.And for those who leave, what was once a series of added features turns into a headache.While it isn’t going into details on when or how the upcoming iOS release will improve things, Apple is certainly hoping to have a solution once that is in place.Until then, users can avoid problems if they turn off iMessage on their iPhone and uncheck the phone numbers from any other Apple devices on which they are using iMessage before switching to a new non-Apple device. However, this requires some planning and still may not a guarantee a smooth transition.Apple also has a means to try to remove users from its iMessage system after they have switched off their iPhones, but this process has a more spotty track record. The recent server bug worsened things significantly, leaving Apple’s support staff temporarily unable to use their standard methods for trying to deal with iMessage problems.“We recently fixed a server-side iMessage bug which was causing an issue for some users, and we have an additional bug fix in a future software update,” Apple told Re/code in a statement. “For users still experiencing an issue, please contact AppleCare.”",mid,mid,mid,mid,mid
Ayush-Verma-4,"Be good at what you doIn every field of work, the most highly regarded people are those who are the best at what they do. Everyone loves competent people, especially those who present their best work all the time. If you’re just starting out in your profession, that dosen’t mean you’re not deserving of respect. It’s about starting small and building from there.Respect othersRespect is 2-way. If you want others to respect you, you have to respect others first. If you have ever come across someone who isn’t being respectful to you, I invite you to think of just one person you’re not being respectful to in your life now. Chances you’ll find at least someone. Rather than harp on how people are not respectful to you, work on being respectful to those people you’re treating shabbily. It’ll help you reach new heights in your relationship with others. Honor what you sayNo one likes a dishonest or unreliable person. A well respected individual is one who is honest in his/her communications and can be trusted to do what he/she promised. Be open to criticismsContrary to popular belief, being respected doesn’t mean you won’t receive criticism. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. The more known you are in your work, the more criticisms you’ll receive. It’s not about rejecting criticisms but about being able to handle criticism gracefully.Treat yourself with respect If you don’t respect yourself, you can’t hope to get respect from others. Start off by loving yourself. The love from others will come subsequently. Don’t bad mouth othersWhether it’s in a professional or social setting, it’s not appropriate to bad mouth people. You certainly don’t earn respect this way. If you’re unhappy with a certain individual and what he/she is doing, talk to him/her and work things out. Don’t talk behind his/her back. This is the kind of behavior that attracts gossip and negativity. Not only does it reflect badly on you as a person, it also hurts the other party, whether you realize it or not. Be honest and transparent in your communications. Stand up for what you believe in Personally, I have more respect for someone who disagrees (civilly) and stands up for himself/herself than someone who parrots others. Likewise, it is by having your own opinion and a mind of your own that you get respect from others. Don’t be afraid to stand up for what you believe in. At the same time, make sure you do it in a respectful manner to others. Be yourself It’s better to be an original version of yourself than an exact duplicate of someone else. People respect individuals who are original. Too many people try too hard to be someone else they are not and in the end they don’t have a sense of identity. Discover who you are and what you stand for. What the world needs are more people who are true to themselves, not clones of each other. Be a role model to othersActions speak louder than words.  You gain respect by walking the talk. The most respected person is the one who inspires others to achieve their best and enables them to unlock their highest potential.",mid,mid,mid,mid,mid

Listen with all your attention                                                                   Give your full attention to the person you’re talking with. It can change your whole view of the person and vice versa. That makes two happy people!Strike Up Random Conversation With a Stranger -  People LOVE talking to strangers.The moment I look at a stranger and smile, their eyes light up. Once they get started talking, they never want to stop even as they part ways. You can argue that it’s not exactly selfless to talk to others, but it is if you do it simply because you know they love it. Spread happiness with your interactions. Listen More Than You Talk When you talk to others, listen at least 70% of the time.The people in your life will appreciate it and you can brighten their day, everyday.Genuinely Compliment Someone  Be genuine. This makes you feel good and it’s much better than gossiping, Since you’re spreading positive words and thoughts with the people around you.Ask Someone If They Need Help   If you have even the slightest suspicion that someone may be feeling down or is struggling, just ask for help. They’ll most likely tell you everything is fine, but they will feel better just because you showed you care. It’s powerful and you can’t ignore it. People want to feel like they’re there.Encourage others to see the funny side of their life                     Help the overly serious see that being funny won't dent their image and might just provide them with the flexible edge needed to really get ahead in this world.Help your friends and family to have a good laugh                          Prove your importance to your loved and cherished ones by helping them laugh a little more. Shout them to a cinematic or theatrical comedy, read funny stories to them, or tell them jokes ( I have learned this over time from my younger sister) .Be Grateful                                                                                                          Gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness. Gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships.“Happiness is not a goal…it’s a by-product of a life well lived""",mid,mid,mid,mid,mid
Ayush-Verma-4,"It isn't dead yet But It's the dead pitches that will kill test Cricket.""A pitch that will suit bowlers who take the pace of the ball."" There are more depressing phrases like this that a commentator can utter at the start of a Test match.  A slow dead pitch is punishment for players , the spectators really want to see-the genuine fast and nasty bowlers, the flashy stroke makers and spinners who give the ball a rip. Too often these days, spectators are being asked to watch test matches on surfaces that encourage tedious, defensive cricket. No wonder people want to watch pyrotechnic Twenty20 action in Indian Premier League. Dead pitches are a disease spreading around the cricketing world. English grounds are now producing a succession of chief executive-friendly pitches. Would Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Johnson , Pat Cummins have topped 150 km/h if they had cricketing education  in England rather than Australia. I guess they would have sacrificed pace and aggression for something more pragmatic. We want pitches that provide a genuine contest between bat and ball, Once that offer pace and carry and reward attacking and daring cricket. Test cricket has proved that when It's bad It's unwatchable and when It's good It's unmissable.Too often It's the former. Getting some life into pitches would go a long way towards ensuring the more of the latter.",mid,mid,mid,mid,mid
Ayush-Verma-4,"We generally relate happiness to a Person or Thing or a particular situation or position which makes us proud. Like if we love anybody we are pleased to see them . They may be our friend, our relative, teacher, student, our pet animal or any person.Similarly, getting something non-living like a watch, a camera, a particular instrument which we like to play most or some prize  etc.  makes us feel happy. Likewise there may be a particular situation which makes us feel happy like playing some game, travelling beautiful places, eating our favourite dish, listening to some music or getting promotion etc. Thus, if we sum up, we can say that happiness for us is something which is related to our senses - to watch, to listen, to talk, to taste, to smell, to touch etc and the most important feature of the so-called happiness is that it is related to something outward whereas the real happiness is in ourselves. The pseudo happiness makes us happy for a particular moment or for some time. In other words, it is not permanent. All the situations described above give us a temporary happiness if we call it happiness anyway. But I feel the real happiness has nothing to do with something outside.   It has something to do with our inner self.This is a permanent happiness whereas the happiness we get from outside becomes a cause of sorrow when we lose that person, thing, situation or position.",mid,mid,mid,mid,mid
Shalin-Agrawal-1,"I am a CLD student in my first yr at IIIT-H. I gave my interview on the 9th of june 2014. That was the first ever interview i gave in my life and turned out to be one hell of an experience.They started off by asking me the meaning of my name.Then they asked me about my school life and my hobbies.After this they asked me if i knew anything about linguistics. Now, before going for the interview, i had only read whatever i could from the first 3-4 links that open up when you google computational linguistics. There was a term called cognitive psychology which caught my eye and i ended up reading a lot about it. I was honest about it. What followed was a series of questions based on my understanding of the need, use and future scope in computational linguistics.The next activity was rather different. They asked me to write a sentence in my native language on the board and asked a few questions based on that, like rephrasing it or why i chose a particular word or how the meaning of the sentence would change if i alter a few words. Their main focus in this section was to ask me about how i could make a machine understand my language, how i could create a database through which a machine could interpret my language. We also talked a little about Google Now and Siri.What you can do is read a little about linguistics on internet.Make sure you carry a file with important certificates along with you. I would say there is no fixed set of questions which they ask, it all depends on which way you lead them. Try not to lie because they are smart people and can easily make out if you are lying. Hope this helps!!",high,mid,high,high,high
Shalin-Agrawal-1,"How Telling The Truth Could Boost Your HealthA man goes to see his doctor. He says, “Doctor, I want to be healthier.” The doctor says, “No problem. From now on, always mean what you say.”That may sound like the start of a joke, but it’s actually a crib note version of results from a new study suggesting that sincerity and honesty are keys to good health.As part of a study at the University of Notre Dame, professor Anita Kelly and her team recruited 72 adults and randomly assigned them to two groups: a Sincerity group and a control group. The control group wasn’t given specific instructions (other than they’d be in a study for the next five weeks, topic unstated), but the Sincerity group was given the following mandate:“Throughout every day of the next five weeks, you must speak honestly, truthfully, and sincerely — not only about the big things, but also about the small things, such as why you were late. You must always mean what you say in situations where your statements are to be taken seriously, as opposed to when joking or obviously exaggerating. While you certainly can choose not to answer questions, you must always mean what you say.”During the next five weeks, both groups came to the lab for periodic polygraph tests and standard measures of physical health. By the fifth and final week, Kelly says that the results were “amazing.” The Sincerity group reported significantly less physical health symptoms than the control group – specifically fewer sore throats, headaches, and nausea. They also reported fewer mental health complaints like feeling tense.The average age of the study participants was 41, and other than the Sincerity group’s mandate to “always mean what you say,” there were no other major distinctions between the groups. The pivotal factor over the five-week period was consistently telling the truth.Arguably, honesty is not the normal state of affairs for most humans. Research from lying expert Robert Feldman suggests that about 60 percent of us have a hard time getting through a ten-minute conversation without lying at least twice. Kelly estimates that the average person lies about 11 times a day. Perhaps all of that lying causes a continual level of psychosomatic stress that handicaps our immune system.Why might it have taken five weeks to see results?  Possibly because it takes a while for the average fibbing human to retool for honesty. According to Kelly, “Being sincere is a process.” Going from daily lying to a clean slate takes time. It could also be that the health benefits of telling the truth accrue cumulatively.",high,mid,high,high,high
Shalin-Agrawal-1,"I am a CLD student at IIIT hyderabad. I just completed my first year, so i guess, i am in a good enough position to answer your question.Computational linguistics (CL) is a discipline between linguistics and computer science which is concerned with the computational aspects of the human language faculty. It belongs to the cognitive sciences and overlaps with the field of artificial intelligence (AI), a branch of computer science aiming at computational models of human cognition.Well, that's how Hans Uszkoreit, Professor of Computational LSinguistics at the Dept of Computational Linguistics at the Saarland University defines it.The course is very much similar to a normal CSE course, except the fact that you'll be studying atleast one Linguistics courses every semester. There'll be some electronic courses which you'll be missing out on. But you can cover them by taking electives later on. Except that, the coursework is roughly the same as other courses.Computational Linguistics tries to solve problems in the following areas:    Machine Translation    Natural Language Interfaces    Document processing and information retrieval    Computer-Assisted Language LearningPopular applications of Computational Linguistics are Google Translate, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Now.LTRC or Lnguage Technologies Research centre, is where the research goes on. It is one of the finest in the country. You'll be doing your research under some of the stalwarts in the field.There're ample opportunities if you wish to pursue further research in computational linguistics. If you don't, you still have a btech in CS, which provides for great offers in computer science. I'd suggest you read more about Computational linguistics to decide if the fiels interests you.Hope it helps!",high,mid,high,high,high

I was really fed with this routine of studying everyday hoping to perform well in that one exam. I wanted to get this over with as soon as i could. Overall, i was really frustrated with my life. Just then, the auto wala asked me where i was coming from(since he picked me up from the station). It was a long journey so we started chatting a little and he started narrating his story of how he became an auto wala.Apparently, he and his cousin had just gotten out of college and were applying for jobs everywhere but couldn't find any. So, they decided to buy an autorichshaw and decided that one of them could drive it at night and the other one during day time. This way they could earn some cash till both of them find a job. Now, they obviously had to take a loan to buy that auto. Just about a month later, this guy got an offer from Indian Railways. But the problem was he had to pay his half of the installment for repaying the loan. Only after they repay the loan, could they sell the auto. So, he worked in the Railways during the daytime and rode auto during the night. I just couldn't help but appreciate this guy for his hardwork, i mean how frustrating it would be to drive an auto despite having a stable source of income.",high,mid,high,high,high

So I am going to address that first.Do you find her beautiful?Most people in the world find her beautiful, but for some reason I do not find her beautiful. Do you find her beautiful?I do not know about you. Many people would not relate beauty to her. But I find her really beautiful. The fact is that beauty is subjective. And it is rightly said that, ""Beauty lies in the eyes of beholder"". What do you think of this woman?She is Lizzie Velásquez. She suffers from a rare congenital disease that does not allow the body to accumulate fat. She was called the ""ugliest woman on earth"" by some. She refused to bow down and is a motivational speaker now, a true inspiration for anyone. It does not matter how you look, what matters is how you feel about it. If you feel you are ugly, the world would make you feel that you are ugliest. So you have to change your glasses and look at yourself differently. Find out your strength, everyone has some. Work on your strengths and take on the world. Just like beauty, intelligence is over-valued as well. There are so many people who have made difference to the world with average looks and IQ. Change your glasses and find your passion.All the best!Edit: Thank you for all your comments and insights. Request you to read Freyja White's comment here.

I am sure there are enough people in the west whose lives are bigger struggle than many people in all the countries you have stated.There are enough people born to rich parents in developed countries.... and they are struggling in their life.Personally I feel that the parents one is born to, are more important than the country one is born in. I am sure there are enough parents in Iraq and all other countries who have supported their kids to grow up and have happy life. Someone mentioned that being born rich can be helpful in certain countries like India. I was born to very simple parents. My father lost his mother when he was 12 years old, my grandfather was perpetually on bed. My father worked first to feed and educate his siblings and then to educate us.  I feel I am so lucky to be born to such parents in India.They taught me the value of hard work.They taught me the value of love in a family.They taught me that one does not need to be rich to give to others, giving comes from attitude one has, and not from the bank balance.They taught me that responsibilities in life are above pleasures.They taught me the value of money... and the fact that it really does not have any value... it is a means to fulfil other needs/goals and should not become a need/goal in itself.

Doctors gave him a year to live. 23 years later, now he is married and have two healthy kids. I have experienced cancer very closely in life with my grandmother beating cervical cancer, my aunt surviving breast cancer, my cousin winning over blood cancer, and another uncle of mine succumbed to lung cancer. Beating cancer is a lot about your ability to fight. People with a fighting attitude come out better than others who give in. Another story is of Anita Moorjani here - Home. She survived cancer and had a near death experience. There are some very good ideas here. I would give you two that might help you in this time. 1. Gratitude - Make a list of people who have helped you grow in life, people from whom you have learnt something. Write names of all people you can remember since you were a kid. Once you have made the list, start sending them 'Thank you"" notes. Your note should thank them and tell them what you are thankful for. Send one note a day. This would add beauty to your life.

Two people in same environment react differently because they make different choices. Peace is within you, you only have to look inside. 6.

Arti-Gupta-1,"I have been tagged as a ""fast learner"" by most of my teachers, so I think I should answer this question. I have two brothers, me and my oldest brother were supposedly ""fast learners"" and my second brother was so called a ""slow learner"". So I have seen both styles of learning very closely. Let me start by saying, ""being a slow learner is not necessarily a bad thing"". My slow learner brother is doing really well for himself. There was one key difference in our styles of studying. Me and my oldest brother followed Active studying compared to my second brother who was a less active than us. Active studying means involved, intense studying. Active Studying allowed us to focus better. I believe the amount of focus one has while learning makes a huge difference on the speed and depth of learning. In order to focus we did the following-1. Explained concepts to ourselves - When we learned something new, we explained it to ourselves aloud. If you could hear us, you would have felt that we were conducting a class. You could hear us even while doing maths :). Talking to oneself while learning helps to - Focus as one gets completely involved in the concept - Comprehend better - Retain better as one revises on the go 2. Made notes - We used to make extensive notes. Writing in our own language helped again to focus, comprehend and retain. 3. Summary sheet - I would make one sheet of paper on which I would write every important formula or concept that I may forget. One sheet made it easy to carry and revise any time of the day. Because we studied with such intensity, we could not sit beyond 2-3 hours at a stretch. Compared to us, our other brother could sit and study from morning to evening. I feel people who learn fast have a chance to falling into the zone of overconfidence very easily just like the rabbit in the classic story :).",mid,high,high,low,low

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi has worked extensively on how to be in zone?According to his work, being in the zone is a factor of skill and challenge. If challenge and skill both are low, a person shows no interest in the task. If challenge is high and skill is low, there is anxietyIf challenge is low and skill is high, a person is relaxed and gets distracted. If challenge is high in line with high skill, a person performs in the zone.  Assess your situation when you study, how would you rate your skill and challenge at hand? Tweak with the level of challenge to get focus. IDEA 2 - Goal setting and achievement using commitment, reward, and punishmentSet a goal for 2 hours and promise yourself that you would not get up before achieving your goal. You can announce this goal to people at home. Announcing to people helps to get commitment. Reward yourself every time you are able to achieve a stretched goal. Give yourself a treat, something you would not do normally. Decide a punishment for yourself if you fail to achieve your goal. For ex -  Give your iPad to your sibling, tell him/her your goal.

I am not sure how you yourself feel when someone points your mistake. If you take feedback openly, you are way mature for your age.  How feedback is taken depends a lot on the way we give feedback. I would share a feedback pyramid based on Sir John Whitmore’s feedback method.  There are 5 levels of giving feedback – Level 1 - Personalized Criticism - You write off the person, and what happens when someone says you are good for nothing? You become good for nothing. This is the worst way to give feedback.  Level 2- Judgmental Comment – You make a comment on other person’s work or behavior without going into details. In this method, you separated their work/behavior from them, but you are not likely to achieve any positive result.  Level 3 – Some Information – You provide some information about the work, but still lack clarity.  Level 4 – Close-ended question – You ask the person to rate their work/behavior. Asking makes sure that the person is not offended, still this method lacks a direction.  Level 5 – Open-ended question – You ask questions in the direction you see a gap and generate awareness in the other person. This is the most effective way to give feedback since it makes the other person think and accept their gap without getting offended.  Having said that, before you give feedback to her please check if she is comfortable having a conversation in English. We judge people from the behavior we see, we forget that there are underlying values, beliefs, fears, and thoughts that guide their behavior. She might be good in writing English, speaking has its own challenges. So please make sure you have a clear picture before you take a step. You may start by asking questions like this- How do you feel about meeting people from other schools?What is the best part of meeting new people?Is there anything that you do not like?What do you think about talking to them? (Wait for her to answer and take cues from her answer.)Do you understand them well?Do you think they are able to understand you well? (Here you might add that you find it a challenge at times even if it is not true. This would help her open up.) Take cues from her answers and design your next question. I am sure you got the point.

It is something I can certainly not live with. But what exactly is looks? Is it your complexion? Is it your features? Is it your height? Is it the muscle on your body? Is it your hair? A bit of everything makes your looks. But apart from your physical features, it is also the way you dress, the attitude you have, and the way you carry yourself.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Congratulations that you love to read. I hope you watch what you consume, as many have suggested. Reading, writing, and expressing face-to-face are 3 different skills. Reading well in no way guarantees the other two. Even if you would stop reading, your expression would not improve by itself. I feel expression depends on-1. Comprehension - How well you are able to comprehend what you read/listen? Sometimes we read the whole page without understanding a thing. So analyse how well you comprehend. 2. Retention - Retaining what you read/listen helps you to add content to your expression. 3. Clarity of thinking - When you think about a topic, are thoughts and ideas jumbled up or clear? To express well, it is extremely important that you are able to think clearly. Only then, you would be able to convey your thoughts well. 4. Confidence to express - At times we know everything, but our self-doubt makes us swallow our words. If this is the case, then I would go with Brian Rouley's suggestion of joining Toastmasters. It is a brilliant platform to practice face-to-face expression. You can look for a club close to you and join. You are only 19, you would be absolutely fine if you start working now. And please, do not stop reading. All the best!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"For last 15 minutes I have been thinking if I should answer this question. Usually I stay away from questions that use generalizations, but I feel compelled to answer this one.  Q. Do Indian men lack respect for women?Indian men are a group of 600 million plus people. How could they be representative of anything? Having spent close to 4 decades in India and close to Indians, I confidently say that I can count on fingers the number of men I found demeaning to women (this would be a minuscule fraction of all men I know).  Having said that, I cannot deny that women safety is an issue. I am from Delhi and the thought of staying in Delhi with my girls gives me jitters.  I have a few questions to women here who personally know someone they would tag as “disrespectful to women”. Is this person only disrespectful to women?How would you rate this person’s attitude towards his ecosystem, his neighbors, his work, his house, and society?  According to my experience I feel the issue is with the whole moral fabric of such people. They feel life is about taking whatever they can from their surroundings. They are takers, they are suckers, they would find short cuts for everything. Women, being the weaker gender get to bear the brunt as well of this mindset.  Q. How has Bollywood influenced this mindset? The video above is not disrespectful; it is outrageous and disgusting. I could not make myself watch it beyond a minute or so. But can such videos be blamed for a man’s behavior? I am not sure.  A question to women again – Think of the man you find most respectful to women, would he leave his morality after watching such videos?  I do not think so! Weak people look for reasons to justify their behavior.   Q. What can we do to change this? I believe the responsibility to bring change is on us (women) only.  We need to spend more time with our kids and teach them values where they have the intellect to understand right and wrong, where our kids are sensitive to other people, and they treat them well. It is going to be a slow process, but effective.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you for asking Richard. The key to convert a small talk into a conversation is to give all your attention to the other person. 1. Place that person on the centerstage of your talk. Make the talk more about the other person, and less about yourself.2. Listen to the other person with your whole body. Yes, your whole body functions when you really listen. Moving while listening to someone is distracting for them. Follow ""ears listening and eyes watching"" rule. People at times convey more from their body language than their mouth. 3. Ask good open ended questions. Funny one... but jokes apart, ask questions that are open but not too open. Imagine a conversation like this between me and my daughter-Version 1:Me: How was school Radhika?Radhika: Hmm, Good. Me: Tell me more about school. Radhika: Yeah, it was good. We had PE, Writing, Maths and Music. Version 2:Me: What did you write in your writing Journal today Radhika?Radhika: I wrote about my Eid holidays. I wrote about the time I slept on the couch while you and papa watched TV. Me: Aww, that is sweet. What did you do in Maths?Radhika: We write number problems and did front row. I told my teacher I completed 20 levels and she said that was enough for the day. Me: What did you do in PE today?Radhika: Today we has a substitute teacher and we learnt to dribble and shoot the ball. In version 2 I asked more specific questions that gave a better direction to Radhika to talk about. When we ask general questions like below, we get general answers. People are conditioned to answer such questions and do not think before answering such questions.Q - How are you? A- I am fine, thank you. Q - Whats up? A- Nothing much.Q - How is life? A- Good, not bad. Alternatively try asking - What is keeping you busy these days? The person would think and answer because mind is not conditioned for this. Imagine you ask me this question.  Conversation would look like this-Richard: What is keeping you busy these days?Arti: Kids have started school. It is Grade 1 and 2 for them, both have started getting homework. Surprisingly their homework takes so much time. On work side, I have some workshops coming next week, I am working on materials for the workshop. Now you could take a cue from my answer, reflect on it and ask me more questions. The fact that I talked about kids before work tells you that I value family over work and that I love talking about my kids. A good way would be to start with kids and then move to work. Richard: Aww you have two kids, must be handful for you. Which school do they go to? Are you happy with the school? Kids this age are so inquisitive, tell me about some interesting conversations with your kids. How is it to have kids with such little gap? How did you manage? What kind of workshops do you facilitate? Are you on your own or work for a company? How did you get into such workshops? What do you love most about your workshops? What is your biggest challenge? I can go on and on with the questions, but I guess you have got the point by now :). All the best and have fun designing your conversations.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Dear Cam You are going through a lot, I wish I could do more than just write a reply to you.  Before I talk about the situation you are facing, I would like to tell you that you are a proficient writer. You took me on your emotional journey, and the ability to do so is a talent. I sincerely hope that you would make good use of it.  Coming to your situation, below is my understanding1.    Low on Self-confidence2.    Lack of emotional support from family3.    No one to vent your feelings4.    Lack of direction in future5.    Finance Let us take them one by one.  1.    Self confidence - There are two parts to confidence Your inner talk - We all have self-doubt, even the strongest and most confident person you know of would have doubted himself or herself at some point. This is called inner game. (by Tim Gallwey, you can read his book by same name - Online Shopping for Electronics, Apparel, Computers, Books, DVDs & more: W. Timothy Gallwey: Books, Biography, Blog, Audiobooks, Kindle) This is the game that goes in our mind. If we fail this game, we obviously fail the ""outer game"" we play in this world in front of every one. We need to find a way to reduce this self-doubt (interference) and reach our potential.  People who appear rock star have been able to reduce this interference and perform as per their potential. Please understand that fear and self doubt are only emotions caused by your own thoughts.  Fear is a figment of our imagination.  What people tell you - If people tell you that your major is worthless, they are obviously wrong. Some famous people who majored in English (from16 Wildly Successful People Who Majored In English): ·     Mitt Romney, CEO of Bain Capital  ·     Grant Tinker, former CEO of NBC and television producer ·     Former Avon CEO Andrea Jung was an English literature major·     Television host Conan O'Brien was a double history and English ·     Nobel Laureate Harold Varmus  ·     Mario Cuomo, former Governor of New York ·     Barbara Walters ·     Award-winning film director Steven Spielberg ·     Former Xerox CEO Anne Mulcahy  ·     Angelo Bartlett Giamatti, former president of Yale University and seventh Commissioner of Major League Baseball ·     Michael Eisner, former Disney CEO There are enough successful people in this world who have not completed their college.  Developing confidence – You might want to read Arti Gupta's answer to How do I change my attitude? Seriously, I hate my attitude. I am shy in nature. What should my attitude be to face people and critics?I have talked about developing confidence here. Hope it would help you.  2.    Lack of emotional support from family – I am a parent, being a parent is not easy. From your details it appears that your mother has been already working hard for you. Her frustration is understandable. I am not sure that she has the bandwidth to understand what you are going through. But she is a mother; she came looking for you when you severed all communication with your family. You just need to hug her and talk, do not think that you would be adding to her problems. Imagine if something happens to you, she would be devastated. I have tried cleaning mess in my life all by myself, scared to go to my mom because of my own reasons. At the end a friend gave me sense to talk to my mom.  That has been the most useful advice I ever followed. Go, talk to your mother, you are a part of her.  A mother has the power to fill for the world.3.    No one to vent your feelings – I am sure talking to your mom would work. You could also start writing, but make sure you write something positive as well. 4.    Lack of direction in future – I read it somewhere, “Can you take a good picture with a shaky camera?” Of course not! Then how can you think clearly with a shaky mind? Get your mind to rest first.You are only 23, you can think about future in a few months/year. Your priority should be to get emotional stability. I would suggest following-·     Learn a new skill like playing an instrument, singing, scuba diving, surfing etc. Learning a skill brings joy and helps in building confidence as well. You can take up any small job to pay for your classes. ·     Practice mindfulness for 10 minutes at least – I would recommend Headspace. You can start by listening to Andy’s Ted Talk here All it takes is 10 mindful minutes followed by videos on youtube or their website. They offer 10 sessions for free, you could repeat them again and again. 5.    Finance – I would suggest that you find a way to sustain like the job you are doing right now. Focus on first 4 things and this one would follow. I sincerely hope that my answer was useful to you. Please feel free to reach out if there is anything you would still like to talk about.

Arti-Gupta-1,"So my question is... with my present personality... continuing like this... will I be a failure in life? What is success? What is failure? Who defines it?

I do not see your traits as a roadblock to success. Will I be able to find a compatible life partner, lead a happy married life?You can definitely find a compatible partner. Would you be happy?

Arti-Gupta-1,"I would differ a bit. I believe that all emotions can be worst, even a positive emotion like HappinessLet me explain..Emotion is a state of mind/body. Our emotion in mind impacts our body as well due to the mind/body connection. Below is the result of a Finnish study which shows the change in our body with emotions. Warm colours like red means more activity and cool colours like blue means less activity. Look at the body response to happiness, love  and anger.Picture courtesy - usnews .comThis change in body activity can have a huge impact on our body and decision making. Anyone acting under the influence of emotion appears to be not thinking.Let us take some examples-Happiness - Generally considered the best emotion we strive for, even this can be fatal. There was a man who was hospitalised due to some serious health problem. At home his wife found a lottery ticket. She was about to throw it when she thought of checking it. When she checked, she found that her husband had won USD 30 million. Out of happiness she went to the hospital. She bumped into the doctor who asked him the reason of her hurriedness. She told him about the lottery. Doctor suggested that the man is not ready for such a big news. His heart might collapse. He volunteered breaking the news to the patient in his own way. He went in and started speaking about different things. What if something goes wrong, how is he placed financially? etc. At one point he asked, what would he do if he won a lottery of USD 30 million? The patient said, ""Doctor if I win I would give half to you."" The doctor heard this and collapsed with a heart attack. Love  - Love can be bad as well if there is attachment in it. Imagine you love someone and the person does not love you back. To some people this can be devastating. Imagine parents in old age longing for their kids. Love can be one of the most destructive emotion if not managed well. One can kill themselves and others under love. Would not go into the detail of other emotions as enough has been talked about a lot of them. Emotion is basically an extreme feeling, an agitation of mind/body.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"I am sorry to say, but to me your goal looks unrealistic. Focus comes when we enjoy something, we get zoned out, we lose track of time. You are 17, and you get B's when you force yourself to study. There is a reason why education is structured over years. A subject is introduced and gradually it becomes more challenging. At 17, your subjects must be challenging. With your way of studying, I suspect that your concepts are not be clear. Let me give you an example-Imagine I am learning swimming. I find it challenging to breathe in freestyle and my coach wants me to practice for 2 hours every day and improve my timing. Is it possible? You can say it is possible, but first I have to focus on getting the basic skill. For you to enjoy something, you need to have a deep understanding of concepts that lead to your current chapter. Do you have that? Are you willing to work on content you studied in previous grades? You are aiming to build a house with weak foundation. My suggestion would be to-1. Understand your strengths and weaknesses. 2. Set realistic goals or you would be frustrated. 3. If you decide that you have to study, take one subject at a time, focus on getting concepts clear. All subjects are interesting once we get the basics right. Get a good teacher for yourself who is ready to invest time in basics. 4. Find your passion and pursue that, or you would be struggling in your life later as well. Hope that helps.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"I would answer in two parts, first my view about the talk and then things that I have done to make life interesting. The talk Frankly I could not go beyond 7 minutes. I dragged myself after 3 minutes and could not continue beyond 7. My answer is based on 7 minutes of the video. The focus of the talk is to make life interesting and memorable. I am not comfortable with demeaning a stable routine job. It is important for many people to have stable lives. Our parents and grandparents lived like this and they were, and are more at peace compared to people who live so called ""interesting"" lives. There are many reasons why people die early today, do not feel sense of belongingness, or become forgetful. I feel it is not the routine, it is the stress that is the killer. Steps I have taken to make my life interestingI believe in Vedas when they say that ""Experience is the unit of life"". Life is measured with the experiences we have and I have done the following to have positive experiences-1. Invest in good friendships  - I have invested in deep meaningful friendships and I do not miss any chance of spending time with my friends. 2. Give people what they want - Make someone's day by giving them what they want. Making someone happy has longer positive impact on me compared with making myself happy. 3. Do the work that I love - I quit and reboot every time I feel I am not enjoying my work. I earn less, but I am happy. 4. Develop the ability to say ""enough"" - I realised that I was earning for my bank as I would never use the money I earned. I did not need the money coming in. This realisation was liberating as I could focus on things I loved. 5. Break rules - I do get selfish and break rules once in a while. Giving in to temptations occasionally is fun. Life is to enjoy and I am not here to set example for anyone. 6. Fall in love - Be a child, fall in love, do crazy stuff, these are memories for life. 7. I create happiness, I create misery - I understand that life is a what I make of it, it is my doing. Events happen but how I feel about them and respond to them is in my hands. 8. Have kids - Kids make life beautiful. I have two adorable daughters aged 6 and 7. They have added innumerable beautiful moments in my life. 9. Learn something - Learning something new has more positive impact on life than we understand. Apart from the actual learning, it brings positivity to life. 10. Quora - Writing and reading on Quora does make life more interesting :). Thank you Aniket for asking.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"There are some good points already been talked about like-Irrational decision makingDecoy affectEndowment effectAnchoring biasMarket norm and social normI am going to talk about a few others and elaborate on market/social norms-1. Thinking of money in relative terms - We try to save $5 while buying something that costs $10, but not while buying something that costs $1000. We think of the value of $5 in relation to $10 or $1000. If you see the absolute value of $5 is same in both cases, but our decisions are guided more by relative value of money. 2. Pain of paying - We feel painful to pay on consumption basis. For example- - Paying after every visit to the gym is more painful than paying in advance.- Paying after every site visit on a vacation is more painful than paying in advance even if it means being able to keep money with one for longer duration. Also, paying by cash is more painful than paying by credit card. Once we understand this, we can use it in positive ways. - I can choose to pay for my shopping in cash if I am a spendthrift. - I can choose to pay for my gym fees in cash so I feel more pain in skipping classes. 3. Market norm/Social norm - People put in more efforts when relationships are in Social norm rather than when they are in Market norm. This is the reason why there are good answers on Quora for free. Market norms means one is paid for their efforts. Social norms means people contribute with their own free will because of a sense of responsibility, belongingness etc. Logically speaking once people are in social norm and contribute, they should contribute more with some additional monetary reward. But surprisingly, adding a reward moves the relationship into market norm and people start attaching value to the effort they put in. Today unfortunately relationships are moving more into market norm leading to higher dissatisfaction. 4. Motivation - When we think of motivation, we attached immense importance to money. If we look at human behaviour money loses its sheen after a certain income level. People look for challenge, sense of accomplishment, completion of task, self esteem, creativity, and sense of belongingness more than financial reward after that threshold. That is all I can think right now. Thank you for asking Mohan.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"For first two years of having kids I kept wondering, why I had them. I used to ask everyone why we have kids and I got a standard reply, “It is an experience.”  And at that time my inner voice said, “It is a very expensive experience, expensive in terms of sweat you put in.” One of my male colleagues shared his personal incident with me once.  It went like this - “After a very bad day at work, I went home and my wife was done with the baby. She gave the baby to me and went away. I was in the kitchen with my baby crying endlessly. For a moment I thought, “Either I should throw him from the balcony, or jump myself.”  I could understand the pain my colleague felt after I had kids.  Those years, I wished someone had told me that-1.    The distinction between day and night would vanish. Having 5 hours non-stop sleep would be a luxury. 2.    My life would turn upside down. Nothing would be about me any longer. 3.    Cooking for 50 people is easier than feeding a kid for a day.4.    Ability to hide anger and behave normally would be tested again and again. 5.    I would need to say one thing a million times before it becomes a habit. 6.    My life would go in a perpetual “conflict resolution” mode with two kids. 7.    External peace would vanish and I would have to learn to find it inside me.   We talk of body being prepared for giving birth; I wish someone had told me I needed to prepare by mind for the baby.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you for asking Ravinder. It is interesting that you asked me to answer this question since I am the OP of this question :). I am a Hindu by birth, but I grew up as an atheist. I only believed in the philosophy of Karma “You reap what you sow”. Believing in Karma helped me to be action oriented, but I did have trouble on a few other fronts.  Most serious disorder was a sense of superiority, with high standards for self and others.  I stumbled on Vedanta with a video from Swami Sarvapriyananda, a senior monk at Belur Math.  Being a Hindu, I knew about soul; Vedanta made me believe it. You could say that it transformed my knowledge to wisdom, and helped me in following ways- Develop Acceptance– Realizing that we all are one; I started accepting others for what they are. I understood that people (as we see) are products of their experiences, and probably I would have been the same if I had similar experiences.  Relate to others– As a student of Vedanta, I connect better with people.  Develop Compassion– Connecting with others, understanding their challenges made me develop a sense of compassion.  Made me reflect more– Now I get the depth of Henry David Thoreau’s quote “What lies behind us, and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us?” I spend more time with my mind.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"My take - One can ABSOLUTELY regain lost respect. There are two parts of the whole process.1. Internal change - Improvement within you2. Change in perceptions of people around youYou would have to work on both the aspects if the objective is to gain back respect. I would club my response for first and third situation. Second situation is not much of a problem as once you improve, give a hit, people would notice. The TRP ratings/box office collections would speak for themselves. Below are the steps I would follow to address the two parts mentioned above. 1. Accept my mistake/failure - I would openly accept my mistakes/recent shortcomings in front of my colleagues/my partner. My vulnerability, sincerity and honesty would earn me a bit of respect here itself. 2. Promise to change - I would promise them that I am going to change and that I would need their help in the process. I would actually ask them on things they think I should do to improve going forward. 3. Bring in change - I would work diligently to improve. 4. Communicate - I would communicate with my colleagues/partner periodically to update them on what I am doing and get their perspective if any change is visible. 5. Incorporate their feedback - I would change my strategy as per their feedback and repeat 3 and 4 till desired goal is achieved. Involving people around you in the change process accelerates the change and helps in gaining back respect.

Arti-Gupta-1,"What do you do when you wake up in the morning? You open your eyes, walk to the washroom and here starts your journey of trust. You open that toothpaste and you trust the manufacturer of having used the right ingredients that would help you clean your teeth without causing you any harm. You stand under the shower trusting that the ceiling is not going to fall, or you would not get boiling water to burn you in between your shower. You get ready and eat products made my people you have never met. You have trusted hundreds of people to deliver you that simple breakfast on your table. You get into the car and drive to work. You trust that people would drive sane in their own lanes. You do not know these people but you trust their driving skills. You get to office and you again trust that people would have responded to you as needed. By the time you go to bed, you have trusted thousands of people without even realising it. You feel you do not trust others, it is an identity you have created for yourself due to some reason. As I just walked you, you do trust others subconsciously. Once you understand this, you can work on consciously trusting others. A few thoughts for you-1. To get trust, you have to give it first. If you do not trust others, chances are that they do not trust you as well. Are you happy with this?2. Trust is risky, you might get stabbed but you might get a friend for life. I have a rule - I am fine as long as I find one gem in 10 people I trust. I am fine meeting 9 wrong people to meet one right one. The results have been far above my expectations.3. People meet your expectations. If you feel they would stab you, chances are that they would. If you expect them to be nice, chances are that they would be nice. 4.

Arti-Gupta-1,"I am writing this answer after exchanging multiple comments with you. I think it would be easy to address your situation if you break it into parts. I see three main issues-Oral communication in English language - You are only 18, studying in India (as I see from your profile). Learning to communicate confidently in a foreign language is a gradual process, so do not lose heart. Practice is the only way, listening and speaking the language would help you. You could also join the local ""Toastmasters club"". Toastmasters is an international not for profit organisation helping people to improve their public speaking skills. Find a club near your place and join. Confidence in general - This needs to be addressed before the language. I have had people in my team who could not talk one sentence in English, but beamed with confidence. So you have to work on your self esteem. I would suggest four exercises a) Write all your achievements since the time you remember. b) Go to people you know and trust, ask them two positive qualities you have. c) At the end of each day, write your achievements. Remember that helping someone is also an achievement, so you would have to think hard to write your achievements. d) Fake it till you make it - Our mind and body are connected. Check the body language of confident people and learn 2-3 confident poses. Start using them consciously, you would feel confident by changing your body language. Clarity of thinking - You are 18, you need to practice clarity in your thinking. I had to ask you many questions before I could get some grasp of your situation. So when you have any situation, talk aloud to yourself, take pen and paper and write in bullet points. Analyse text and write key message in bullet points. Practicing clarity in thinking is very important to make decisions in life. I do hope I was of some help. Please let me know if you want me to cover anything else as well.

I read about mental models and got the idea that everyone behaves as per their perspective of the situation, their experiences in life, and everyone is right as per their circumstances. This started my journey of accepting others for what they are. Accepting others and not trying to change them was truly liberating. 2. Spirituality - Reading Vedanta gave me the knowledge that we all are one. This helped me to be at more peace with myself and others. 3. Mindfulness - Practicing mindfulness is helping me develop the ability to be in present without dwelling into past and worrying about future. Tagging thoughts as useful, useless, positive, negative helped me think more positive. 4. Yogasana and Observing silence - Practising asanas mindfully, I experience bliss that I cannot explain. I try and observe an hour long silence after asana. This helps me maintain calm throughout the day. 5. We are our self-talk - We all have this ongoing chatter in our mind. I trained myself to alter that chatter. An example of this is in my answer here - Arti Gupta's answer to How can I turn a horrible day into a better one? Altering the chatter can lead to peace in any situation. I have started the journey, and realise that it is a long one. Miles to go before I achieve permanent inner peace. But life is definitely more peaceful than before. Om Shanti!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Yes, I did it. I used to get very angry if kids would not listen or not eat on time. I am generally not a person who would speak loud when angry, but I saw myself being loud with kids. After the storm, I would feel bad and cry. So here is what I did-1. I started observing what kind of scenarios made me angry. 2. Anytime I would see such a scenarios coming, I would move physically out of that scene. Pre-empting worked all the time. But I had to find a permanent solution. 3. I started meditation and that changed things completely for me. Our anger is a reaction to an external trigger. Though we want to control ourselves but our brain is very quick and does not give us the time to think and respond. Meditation slows the brain down and helps us to think before we speak. 4. Managing thoughts - Anger is an emotion which results from the way we perceive a situation. Our behavior is like the tip of an iceberg. There is a lot going underneath in us. It is important to understand that. It goes like this-External Action/Trigger -> Wee see/hear -> We think -> We feel ->EmotionThe way we think about a situation has to do a lot with our values, perceptions, mental model, belief etc. The best way to control any emotion is to work at the level of our ""thought"". Change the way you think and your emotion would change. I gave an example of this in my answer here-Arti Gupta's answer to How can I turn a horrible day into a better one?Changing the way you think about a situation is a sure shot way to manage anger. Hope it helps!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Some points to remember when you are making a PPT -1. Understand your audience - Present numbers from their perspective. You should think about questions like-- Who is my audience?- What would they be interested in? - What do I want them to learn from my presentation?- What is my key message?2. Make the structure of your presentation before you start designing slides. You should think about questions like-- What all do I want to cover?- How much time I have?- What would be an interesting start?- How should I end the presentation? - What should the middle be like?- How much time I want to spend on each section?3. Working with data - What is the learning from the data?- Is the learning relevant to the audience?- Use graphs that are simple and readable- While pasting tables, make sure they are readable in PPT. 4. Making the slides - Points to work on-- Every slide should have a learning, a reason to be there. You can also put the key message of each slide at the bottom centre of the slide. - Use visuals, pictures, videos, graphs- Slides should not be cluttered- Do not use flying animations if it is an official presentation. - Slides are basically pointers for you so you do not forget any part of your storyline. 5. Revision - - Review after a day, a fresh mind helps- See if you have been able to pass the message clearly. - Have someone you trust review you presentation, external perspective always helps. The mind of person making the ppt gets clouded after a while. 6. Presentation-- Make sure you know the message for each slide well. - Writing script and practicing helps if you are not very confident. Hope that helps. Let me know if you have a specific challenge. Thank you for asking.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"I agree with Jason Burnett. There is nothing that you should do by certain age. Growing is an individual process for everyone, both physically and mentally. Physically, there can be things that some 60 year olds can do, but 30 year olds would sweat doing. It is your life, your priorities. I think it would be good to ask yourself some questions at this point in time, so you can set your priorities correct. Questions on the lines of -What am I doing? Why am I doing it?What do I really want in life?If I die tomorrow, would I repent not doing something?Am I really happy with the way my life is?What gives me peace?Am I doing enough to get that peace?How have I grown as a person over years? Am I happy with it?Am I living a reactive or responsible life?How does my mind feel?Do I think positive or negative? Am I doing anything for the negative?Do I accept myself? Am I at peace with myself?Do I fear something? Do I need to take a step to remove that fear?What kind of choices have I made in life? How they have impacted othersIf you reflect on such questions seriously and then plan your goals, I believe you would be good to go. All the best!Thank you for asking Arun :).",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Thanks for A2A!I see a contradiction in your question. Why is there anxiety if you trust her more than your eye?  You might be confused and unable to understand her not telling about the relationship, but why anxiety? If anxiety if the right word for your emotion at that point, then you need to re-look at your trust level. I see insecurity when you get anxious. And insecurity means lack of trust. A point for you to ponder. Now coming to your situation - You have not mentioned anything about her response when you have tried talking to her about this in the past. That would have helped to answer better. In the absence of the information, I can give you following lines to think on-1. There are some people who are more open about their life than others. Where do you see your girlfriend? Is she closed about other things in her life as well or it is only about you?2. What is the culture and background she comes from? Is it normal for people in her family/friends to have affairs? If not, then this might explain her reservation. 3. Are you sure that she is proud of the relationship she shares with you? What is the kind of future she sees with you? How old are you guys? How frequently do you discuss future?At the end, acceptance of your partner is the key to peace. If you are sure that you trust her and she loves you, why does it matter to you in the first place? That again makes me feel that there is some gap in the trust?I guess you need to reflect and then talk to her. I am sorry if I have unsettled you more, but based on the information you have given you need some soul searching. All the best!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"You do not deal with the other person, you deal with yourself. Q. Why do we feel bad when someone disagrees with us always? A. We think they do not like us, and do not trust our intelligence. We think that they feel we are not smart enough, and that they are smarter than us.  Basically we have all sort of negative thoughts in our mind when we are with such a person.  In this mindset, how can we deal with the other person and get positive results?  So one has to deal with themselves first, and that takes care of the other person automatically.  Q. How to deal with yourself?A. You start by creating positive thoughts in your mind. Thoughts manifest themselves in the energy we carry, our body language, and our tone. A person’s behavior is a projection of their deep-rooted values, beliefs, and experiences. You might have behaved the same way had you been through similar circumstances. Give people benefit of doubt. Do not judge people by their behavior. People who hurt others are generally hurt inside. Many times they are victims of inferiority complex. See for any such symptoms, this would change your perception of the other person. Tell yourself that it is not important for everyone to agree with you. It is not important to convince everyone to what you think, people can live their lives with their thoughts and opinions. May be the other person thinks the same way for you. Watch your own thoughts, and behavior when you are with this person. Separate the person from issue at hand and listen to them, maybe they have a point. Thank you for asking Nguyen. Hope that helps.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"I can relate to what you are saying, I used to get paranoid when my 1 year old would not eat one meal properly, falling sick would turn me crazy. Now my kids are 6 and 7 years old. This is what I did-1 Acceptance - I developed acceptance for their falling sick. I realised that falling sick is a part of growing up. They would fall more sick as they leave the comfort and cleanliness provided at home, they would get all kind of infection home. Falling sick is fine, that is the way to develop immunity. They are getting ready to face the world :). Currently you see sickness as odd and unwelcoming; embrace it and you would feel lighter. 2. Find a mentor parent - I have a friend who is more experienced than me in raising kids, I admire her for her understanding of being a parent. I call her whenever I struggle with my emotions. It is reassuring to hear from another parent who has been there, and done it. Find your mentor, this would help you relax when you most need it. 3. Reflect back - I realised that my getting anxious at any of the moments did not help. When kids are sick, I need to be strong otherwise I would fail to take care of them. Reflect on your behaviour and see how your anxiety helped you. You would realise that it was a de-energising for everyone around you. Stress brings down our problem solving skills, I am sure you would have done better without being stressed in those situations. Kids settle by the age of 5, your kid would be fine :). Hope that helps :). God bless you and your family.",mid,high,high,low,low

Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you Sankar for asking and for adding details. My understanding - You have a job that many people in the world aspire for, and yet you feel a void. Your job does not give you meaning and that feeling of satisfaction, you feel that you might repent if you die this way. You want to break the circle and do something more meaningful in line with your passion. You seem to be going through mid-life crisis and the decisions you take at this juncture would determine how peaceful and satisfying your rest of life would be. Unfortunately no one else can help you to find the purpose of your life. I can only suggest you a few ways-1. Write your thoughts - Take time out to write your thoughts at least 2-3 times a week. This would give you clarity. 2. What are you ready to give in order to be able to pursue your passion? Life is about choices, if you have to choose between money and passion, what would you choose? Is passion more important than money at this point in your life or is it the other way?3. Talk to your best friend/ someone who understands you - Find a sounding board, it helps when you have to make key decisions in life. 4.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Hello dear, I am writing to you after reading your whole conversation with Les Matheson. Les has given you beautiful thoughts, I would add a few bits.  I feel that the journey looks like this-Step1 - You learn stuff from school, home, friends. Step2 - You enjoy the learning and bask in the glory of your knowledge. Step3 - You start questioning what you have learnt. This is where you feel disconnected with others as everyone else seems to be ok with the way things are. You think they are crazy, they think you are crazy, and it freaks both of you.Step4 - You keep moving step by step on your journey to question, explore, and introspect. After multiple trial and errors, you find your balance. Once you find your balance all the dust settles. Now you do not worry about sense of security, connecting with others, losing others, ego etc. Though you understand that you are one with people, you also understand that people have built their walls of ego and they live life the way they want to live, with their beliefs, and you do not have much control on their beliefs. Now you look at them with compassion and over a period of time a bit of that rubs on them. Personal growth in life involves learning as well as unlearning but that does not make the learning useless. We question because we learnt. If someone gave me the recipe of inner peace on day I started going to school, chances are that I would have laughed at it. We learn and accept things with our experience, and learning/unlearning contribute to our experiences in a big way. Hope that helps. All the best!",mid,high,high,low,low

Arti-Gupta-1,"Thanks for A2A.I have been thinking of this question and thinking of a simple way to answer you. I am not sure I have one... but I would try. Let us take it in two aspects - Spiritually and Psychologically SpirituallyWe want to be happy because that is the inherent nature of the soul that we have (as per Vedanta).Bliss means a state beyond happiness. It is a state of purity, of inner peace which is always there. We actually aim for all these aspects. Somewhere they relate to the Maslow's hierarchy as well. Physical need means foodEnergy is life, air, the vital force that keeps us aliveMental refers to our mind, our emotionsWisdom is the knowledge we strive forBliss is the happiness PsychologicalBeing happy makes us happy... haha... I mean it makes us feel good. It releases positive hormones in the body. It is life giving. The whole mechanics in body makes it a positive experience and our mind wants to experience it again and again.We somewhere believe that happiness is difficult to achieve. And we always run for things that are difficult to achieve, so it becomes a constant ""pursuit of happiness"". We set personal goals and believe that achieving these goals would make us happy. So, constant pursuit of happiness gives a meaning to our life. _______On a side note, I am not sure if we pursue only happiness. The way the world is hooked on to reality shows and drama makes me feel that we are just addicted to ""emotions"" in general in our life. And the absence of these emotions leads to ""depression"". We do not know how to handle the void. But that is my personal observation and thought.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"A Story of Two MonksOnce there were two monks traveling when they arrived at a river. At the river they discovered a woman struggling to get across. Without a second thought, the older of the two monks asked the woman if she needed help, then swiftly picked her up and carried her across to the other bank.It should be understood that for monks, especially in ancient times, any contact with the opposite sex would be strongly frowned upon, if not forbidden. The actions of the older monk greatly troubled the younger monk, who allowed his feelings to fester for several miles while they continued their journey.Finally, the younger monk confronted the older monk, ""How could you have done such a thing? We are not even supposed to be in a woman's presence, but you touched her, carried her even!""The older monk calmly replied, ""I put that woman down miles ago, back at the river. But you are still carrying her."" The younger monk realized the older monk was indeed correct and they continued on their journey.Hating someone is like carrying them in your life all the time.

Arti-Gupta-1,"I am not sure if I am the right person to answer this. I have never experienced this. God has blessed me with friends I can talk to. Maybe I can think of my husband and answer this question. He has many friends (and me :), but he never feels the need to talk about his emotions. He is always content and happy. This is what he does-1. No indulgence in negativity - When we spend time with negativity, we become depressed and that is when we look for people to share our emotions with. 2. Acceptance - He does not try to change people around him. He accepts himself and people, this gives a lot of peace. 3. Work - He is a workaholic, starts his day at 8 am and works till 9 pm, or even later most days. 4. Passion - He is passionate about keyboard, movies and sports. However busy he is, he would always know about the latest movies and happening in sports. He finds time for what he loves and that gives him happiness. 5. Giving - Having a giving attitude with zero expectations towards people gives him lot of peace. And some suggestion from me-1. You can definitely look at making friends. The journey of life becomes more enjoyable when we have someone to share it with. 2. What about trying ""spirituality""?

Arti Gupta's answer to How can I turn a horrible day into a better one?- I enjoy life as I understand that I can actually die any moment, so it makes sense to enjoy this one. - I enjoy life as I love being with myself as much as I love being with my family and friends.- I enjoy life as I know my priorities well and refuse to waste time in doing things because every one else is doing them.I enjoy life because life is so amazing. You just need to look at it. There are miracles everywhere-- Have you wondered how sun shines every morning, how blissful sunshine is?- Have you even wondered on how a new life comes into being? Isn't it miraculous?- Waves in ocean, sound of wind, chirping of birds, stars at night, there is wonder in everything. I enjoy life because when I close my eyes and look inside, I feel bliss. Life throws challenges, but that is what makes the journey amazing. Imagine staying in a huge castle with hundreds of servants, a place where all your wishes are granted.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Can you imagine a boxer becoming a physicist? Yes... Boxing and PhysicsThis is the story of Paul G Hewitt  (source - Page on concentualphysics.com)A former boxer, uranium prospector, sign painter, and cartoonist; Paul began college at the age of 28 and fell in love with physics.Before the advent of Professor Hewitt's textbook of Conceptual physics, it was traditionally taught primarily as applied mathematics - geared to students with high math and science aptitudes. As such, any serious study of physics was out of the educational mainstream for most students. Hewitt's conceptual approach changed all this. By translating the central concepts of physics from mathematical language to common English, and by explaining physics rather than proclaiming physics, and by extensive use of analogies as a teaching tool, Hewitt brought physics into the educational mainstream. His textbook, the leading physics textbook for nonscientists since 1971, has changed the way physics is taught to both nonscience and science majors as well.Check out one of the video from his series to explain the concepts of equilibrium- Age is only a number- Monet started painting at 40 after his wife died.- Van Gogh started at 26 as pointed by Owen Caterwall- Kathy Martin started running at 40. In her 50s, she broke many American records - Kathy Martin Started Late but She Is Catching Up- My mother in law completed her masters after giving birth to 3 kids and then went on to complete her PhD and have a successful career in teaching. - Joseph Conrad did not speak any English till he was 20.

I would personally take anyone who guarantees to change my life, with a pinch of salt.  It is almost impossible to find the kind of coach you are looking for. There are people who touch our lives and guide us without our knowing it, we just have to listen and follow their advice.Below are some questions that might help you get some clarity. -Why do you want to graduate? What would you get by graduating? Do you really need it? What would you lose if you do not graduate? - What do you want to do in life for a living? Is graduation important for that? - What is better - Taking a step that might be wrong or not taking a step at all? - Why do you want to change the world? How important is it for you? Would you be at peace if you die without making any impact on the world? - Close your eyes and imagine your life 15 years from now if you would not change anything. How would you be? Your health, friends, work? Are you happy with what you see? If yes, there is no need to do anything. If not, what should you be doing to change the future?- For how long do you intend to be without friends? Do you like it this way? What is stopping you from meeting new people? - Are you still living with the thought of the girl who left you? What are you gaining by it? Who is losing in this whole situation? - Are you proud of your life? - If you cannot change yourself, what makes you think that you can change the world? The answers are all within you.

This message is to express my gratitude for everything I have learnt from you. In the span of 2+ years, you contributed a lot to what I am today.

I still remember how you stood for me when someone from Sales had an argument with me. That image of yours is in my memory. 2. To understand your roots and take care of your parents.

Because you find his friends weirds, you would find him weird as well after some time. A person is definitely known by the company he keeps. 4. He is caring. I saw my ""would be"" hugging my mom once before marriage as there was something she was worried about. I knew at that moment that my choice was right. 5. He is kind to all people irrespective of their social rank. 6. He does not give in for everything you want. This would prove that he is just trying to make you happy and this would not continue for long. 7. When you have a disagreement, you discuss views rather than argue. 8. He does not get crazy with you talking to other boys. There should be no sign of insecurity. Having talked a lot about him, a lot depends on you as well whether you would be happy or not.

Whom I know is more important to be promoted, than how I work.4. The organisation does not care for me, why should I slog?5. I am not paid as well as I should be for my effort. The reality-1. When we take up a job, we know our role and we know the amount we would be paid. We take up the job knowing everything. 2. No one tells us that our boss would acknowledge our work x times a year and we take up the role knowing it. If we change our thoughts to somewhat like this-1. I work because I need to pay my bills. 2. I work because I love my work. 3. I get a good sleep if I do my best. It is my duty to do my best when I am given a task.4. Doing my work is in my control, let me focus on that only. Whether my boss appreciate it or not is out of my control. Why waste my energy on it.

Do you realise that you might be harming your relation with him by pushing him for something he does not want?As a parent your role is to find what your kid loves and then give him the environment to nurture in that. Imagine you have a plant of yellow rose, but you feel red roses are more beautiful and have more market value. Every time you see a yellow bud, you chop it off and wait for a red one to appear without realising that a yellow rose won't give you red flower. It is the same with kids... they are made certain way, have some inner talent. We have to identify that talent rather than expecting them to deliver on what we think is good. A lot of students out there are caught up in delivering on their parents expectations.

What should you do?Option 1 - Quit and find another job though there is no guarantee that your new manager would be your dream manager. Option 2 - Keep working and feel like a victimOption 3 - Work and understand that we work for ourselves. Find your reasons to stick there. Are you getting anything - Self satisfaction, learning? If yes, then this is your result. Do not expect anything else and you would be at peace. All the best Laurens and thank you for asking.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Hello NikhilThank you for A2A. This is a tough one to answer like this. I definitely need more information to give a meaningful reply. I can give bookish answers on why people live, but that might not be impactful if someone has come to the edge.My approach here would be to understand the mindset of the person by asking following questions-1. Tell me more about what you are feeling. 2. Why do you think everyone hates you?2. Why do you think people live?3. Why is it important for you that everyone loves you?4. Do you think that everyone in this world loves me?5. Tell me more about your life, your friends and family. 6. Tell me about your growing years.7. I would like to understand self image by asking questions. 8. What are you good at? When was the last time you were working on something and time flew?9. What makes you most happy? When was the last time you were very happy?10. Who is the most important person(s) in your life and why?I would take it further depending on the answers. Let me know if I made any sense. I find it tough to answer such deep situational questions with a straight answer. Regardsarti",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Our misery is not because of what happens, it is because of how we relate to it. Let us look at a horrible day-1. I wake up late for work as my alarm did not work. My first thought is ""It is going to be a super bad day. I have no time and there is so much to do""2. I get into the shower and the water is cold. I hate cold bath. And I am like, ""F*** I knew it, it is a bad day.""3. I have no time for breakfast, so I leave without having anything. 4. I get into my car and the tyre is flat. By now I am very irritable. I am certain that worse lies ahead. I get a cab and leave.5. I reach office and I am told that my boss had been looking for me. I know I have a major presentation today. By now I am certain that there is some challenge. 6. I meet my boss. There is a situation at office and he needs my suggestion on it. I am so exhausted and depleted by now that I have no energy left to think constructively. I obviously so not contribute positively to the discussion. 7. I come out cursing myself and waiting to see what lies ahead. Version 21. I wake up late for work as my alarm did not work. My first thought is ""Glad I woke up at least now. I still have time, I can manage it.""2. I get into the shower and the water is cold. I hate cold bath. And I am think, ""Oh! glad that water is there. What if water was not there."" Cold water ensures I finish quickly :). 3. I realise that I cannot be hungry, so I pick an apple/energy bar to eat at first opportune moment. 4. I get into my car and the tyre is flat. I take a deep breath and call for a cab. Thank God! Cab is here in time. I hop in happily, eat whatever I picked and reach office. 5. I am in a fine mood to give all ideas to my boss and things work well. 6. I come out of the cabin and get on with my work smiling and happy. It is all in the mind. We create energy with our thoughts. Our mind is powerful beyond our imagination. Create positive thoughts and positive energy from these thoughts would ensure that positive happens. All the best!arti",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Life is beautifulIn the morning when I do yoga and sun falls on my face, I feel the beauty of life. When I see a flower bloom, new leaves grow, I feel life is beautiful.

When my little one smiles and I see her dimples, I feel life is beautiful. When I laugh and giggle with my friends, I feel life is beautiful. When I have a deep conversation with my kids, I feel life is indeed beautiful. When I read a good book, I feel the beauty of life.

Arti-Gupta-1,"I think the fact that one would do ""thought experiments"" tells that they believe in the power of thoughts. It is difficult to comment on someone else thought experiments since thoughts are personal, so I would talk about myself. I experiment with my thought when something upsets me. For example when people do not meet my expectations and I am unhappy, I alter my thoughts -I tell myself what all could have prevented them to deliver on my expectations. I tell myself if I trust their intention and the answer is always ""yes"". Then I tell myself that their particular action does not matter if they do care for me. I tell myself why should I have any expectation. Having expectation is my problem. From these thought experiments you can easily conclude that-Being at peace is important for me. I believe that peace and pain is within me, it depends on how I perceive a situation. I believe that I am the creator of my emotions. Relationships are important to me. I reflect and spend time with myself. I believe that life is about ""giving without expectations"". I am not sure if my answer makes sense, if this is what you were looking at. Hope I did make some sense. Thanks for asking Joel!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"1. Result is an end, process is the means. You cannot control the end, you can only control the process, so focus on the process. 2. By focusing on the goal, we forget to enjoy the process. The journey to the goal is longer than the result, so enjoy the journey and forget about the result. 3. Any kind of attachment causes pain. Someone criticises your work and you feel bad because you are attached to the work. You would not have felt bad were you not attached to your work and could look at it in a neutral way.   Work because you are supposed to work, be detached with your actions. 4. Live a life of giving. When you are filling the glass, it would always look half full. When you are taking it, it looks half empty. A life of giving is more fulfilling. Do not be a beggar. 5. Desires bring miseries when we are not able to fulfil them. Learn to minimise your desires. 6. True success lies in happiness.7. We see bad in the world because we are bad inside. We get what we deserve. If we work on ourselves, this world would be beautiful place to live. Swami Vivekananda believed in personal leadership.",mid,high,high,low,low

We have conditioned our life on If-Then model, which means, ""If I would fulfil my desire, then I would be happy"". For e.g.1. If I get that girl, then I would be happy2. If I pass my exam, then I would be happy3. If I get admission in that college, then I would be happy4. If I get promotion, then I would be happy5. If I get a baby, then I would be happy6. If my kids grow up to be good human beings, then I would be happyAnd the list goes on and on...

I dislike remembering all my passwords and pin numbers. I have at least a 100 of them. Life would be easy without them. 2. I want Siri or Google voice to be more effective. If I ask a question, they should respond by a voice answer and not by returning a google result. 3. I wish social media had better privacy. I find Facebook creepy. I change my settings that I should not get any notification mail but I start getting mails suddenly if I do not log in for a few months. It is like Facebook saying, ""I would not let you be in peace.""4. I wish android and Apple IOS  could talk to each other. It can be painful with macbook and android phone. 5. I also wish there was a better phone. I am bored of iPhone (all portable devices look same), samsung sucks, and HTC did not deliver as well.

Arti-Gupta-1,"It is a coincidence that I landed on this page just now. I have got some good criticism on my answer here Arti Gupta's answer to Do girls care about their boyfriends' looks?Yesterday someone sent me a personal message asking how I manage to be not angry with all the people writing negative comments. (Please do not take it as self-praise. I thought I would reply by a scenario rather than theory.)I am posting my reply to that person here-_________________________________I do not get angry as I think the following-1. No one can have views that 100% people on earth agree with. While I have upvotes, there are bound to be people who would not agree. When all people do not agree with God, how can they agree with me?2. My answer has somewhere rubbed them in the wrong way. They are entitled to be upset. 3. They do not know me. They are upset with what is written there, so nothing is personal. 4. And I realise that when I am positive, a bit of my positivity does rub on them after a few interactions. 5. Anger with anger does not give anything. It fuels fire at both ends. And all emotions have cascading effect. If I am upset with something on Quora, I behave bad with the next person I talk to. That person talks badly to the next person he/she meets and it carries on. So, I feel let me break the chain somewhere :). _____________________Why do we get angry when someone criticises our work?Because we think that personal is criticising us / a part of us. If you can figure out a way to tell yourself, that it is your work they are talking about, and not it, it might help. So it is all in the mind, how you take it when someone criticises you. Think about why they said it, get their perspective. That might help.Regardsarti",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"By realising that YOU create your stress, anxiety and fear. Yes, you heard me well. Stress, anxiety and fear are emotions and you are the creator of your emotions. There are triggers everywhere, but how you respond to those triggers should be under your control. And if your emotions are not in your control, your life is like this- (image from reddit)Yes, you are a puppet, controlled by other people. You can read an example of trigger and response here - Arti Gupta's answer to How can I turn a horrible day into a better one?Would you like to live a life of a puppet, laughing and crying on triggers? If not, then please read carefully. 1. Acknowledge that you are the creator of your emotions. So next time when  there is a trigger and you feel stressed, tell yourself - I created stress in myself when my friend was mean to me.- I created anger in me when .......happened.By changing your internal dialogue you would realise that your emotion is a choice.2.Understand that emotions stem from thoughts we create in our minds. This is very well illustrated in the answer on changing a horrible day into a better one above. Please read that link if you skipped it earlier. Work to create positive thoughts in your mind. Have a positive dialogue. Our minds are programmable entities, and they follow ""trash in trash out"" principle. Enter positive thoughts and positivity would come. For example if your friend did not help you, your current thoughts are- This person used me. - I help everyone but no one helps me. - Everyone backstabs.- World is full of mean people. Try changing your thoughts to - - I wonder why my friend could not help me. Hope everything is fine with him. Maybe he himself is in some trouble. Give benefit of doubt to people. - Good times spent with friends is a good enough reward. - Maybe I have not been able to fulfil my friend's expectation at some time. You would realise that changing your thoughts would change the way you feel about the situation, and would give you peace. 3. Understand the power of your thoughts - Our thoughts have the ability to speak louder than our actions. Has it ever happened with you that you thought of some old friend, and he suddenly called you? or you thought of some old song and suddenly it was on air? Our thoughts have energy in them. Negative thoughts spread negative energy and positive thoughts spread positive energy. At times our actions are right, but thoughts are not and our thoughts are conveyed in the form of our body language, voice tone, and invisible energy. Negative thoughts spread negativity to people around us and leads to negative results. 4. Practice mindfulness, peace is within you - Practicing mindfulness helps in watching your thoughts and make it easy to program them. Peace is within you, just like the blue sky is always there above the dark clouds. All the best in your quest of peace.",mid,high,high,low,low

Why do terrorists kill others? Are they bad people?5. She hurt herself and said sorry. I was like, ""You hurt yourself. Whom are you saying sorry to?"" and she answered, ""I am saying sorry to myself because I hurt myself"". :)6. One day she came to me and gave me some 20 kisses all over my arm and then you said…“Mumma, these kisses will remain with you when I go to school tomorrow. They would be with you even after you have a shower…”.7. One night I was upset with both my girls. I was seriously working.Little one came to me and smiled. I did not respond. So here is our conversation-Lil one – When I smile at you, you have to smile back.Me – It doesn’t work like this always.Lil one – No it does.Me – How can I smile?Lil one smiled and showed me how to smile :). Me – How can I do it when I am upset with you?Lil one – Practice it….And I bursted out laughing…..8. One night I asked my younger one say her thank yous to God… and she went like this…Thank you Godfor  Mumma & PapaFor schoolFor teachersFor homeFor toysFor aunty…………………….And then she said….“Thank you for myself”…She actually thanked God for herself. I was touched and did learn something from her that day. It is amazing how they surprise us in so many ways :).EDIT... A few more..9.

She saw it and picked one blue set. Older one picked a pink set. Little one chose one blue set for her friend. Then after a few minutes-Lil one - I would give this pink set also to my friend as I do not like it. Me - You do not give things to people because you do not like them. Lil one - OK.. I will give her blue set also as she is my best friend. Me - That is better. Lil one - And maybe my friend would give me something tomorrow.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you for asking. I am not sure I understand your question well. In your question you mentioned that you get intense when you feel someone is trying to know you, but in your explanation it appears that the intense feeling is random. I would suggest the following-1. Write your mental chatter for 4 days. Mental chatter is the inner chatter in our mind. Write your thoughts throughout the day, specially when you feel intense. I feel you might see a pattern. 2. Talk to someone who is close to you, someone who knows you for years like your sibling, your mother or some friend. They would definitely have some idea about your behaviour. A lot of times we need others to improve our self-awareness. 3. Ask yourself if you have issues trusting people. In case you have such issues, why you have them. 4. Do you dream being in an unwanted situation where people saw you in a way you would not like? This generally means that you have some fear. 5. How confident are you as a person? 6. Are you comfortable talking about yourself to others? Let me know how it goes and we can take it from there. All the best!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Thanks for A2A!1. Candy Crush - I used to play a lot, so I deleted it from my phone. 2. Behaving indifferent with people at times - I realised this was a problem, and actively observed myself in situations where I was prone to exhibiting that behaviour. At night I wrote when I did anything bad. When I did anything bad, I confessed with someone. Observing and measuring over a period led to change. The key steps to change are as below-1. Awareness / Acceptance - I know that I have a problem.2. Intent to change - I have some intent somewhere that I want to change. 3. Deeper understanding of why I want to change - This helps to understand our behaviour and the drive to change better. For my second example, I was sure that I wanted to change as I had ended up hurting someone close to me and did not want to repeat it. Also, I realised that it is not in line with how I perceived myself and how I wanted others to perceive me. There are 100 reasons to not change, but is there one compelling reason to change?4. Resolve to change - Change is a tough process and needs commitment. 5. Strategy to change - There are various ways-Ulysses contract - This is about stopping yourself from doing it. Like i deleted the game from my machine. Another example is - Let us say you like to eat sweets and you want to change. You know you would not be able to resist once you finish food. So you give money to the guy serving you to not give you sweets after the dinner. Sounds crazy, but by doing this you are putting a process to stop yourself from doing it. Negative association - Find a negative association for your bad habit. Like a picture of the fattest person if you want to stop eating sweets, or a picture of person with bad cancer if you want to stop smoking. This helps  a lot in those week moments when we give in.Taking someone in your journey with same issue - Like joining gym with a friend.Commit to 2-3 people that you would change - Once you commit it becomes your ego.

Arti-Gupta-1,"It is very nice of you to ask this question, tells me of your love for your mother. - The best thing you can do is to keep talking to her, even a short call every other day would go a long way in comforting her. - Make sure she is comfortable, and her needs are met well. - A hand written note is magical for parents. She would read it for weeks and weeks. - You can see if she would like to take up something new - social work, singing class, work in some temple etc. One of my uncle got seriously into singing after he retired and that has helped him a lot. - You can buy her a digital frame which syncs to your and your sister's flickr account. She can look at your latest pictures and feel blessed. - Get her a tablet and teach her how to reach you on Skype. - Load her tablet with stuff she would like - songs of her choice, links to her favourite programs, radio station etc. - Give her a surprise visit if possible, her happiness would be immeasurable. - Buy her a nice rocking chair the next time you visit (if she does not have one)That is all I can think of.

Arti-Gupta-1,"I have used headspace, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to get into mindfulness. I frankly found it hard in the beginning. 10 minutes looked way too long for me.There may be several reasons that you find it easy-1. May be you are at peace and it is normal for you to focus. 2. May be 10 minutes is an easy challenge for you.3. As Cencio Farre said, maybe you are daydreaming in between and time passes. I see this as a high possibility since we do not realise how time flies when we are stuck in some thought. I think you can reflect on the result of meditation to see if your process is right. Ask following questions to yourself-How do you feel after the meditation? Do you see any impact in the day? Do you see yourself watching your thoughts more than before during the day?Are you able to control your words in situations you find it difficult to control before?Can you say that you are more self aware now? Did you get any insight into your behaviour in last 10 days? Do you feel more at peace inside? I guess you know the answers you should have if you are really meditating.

Arti-Gupta-1,"ContentmentContentment comes out of acceptance. I am with my friend. I accept her as she is and I am at peace. I am fine with the way my house is, my life is and I am content. Contentment leads to a stable mind. It is not an ingredient for happiness. HappinessHappiness is a positive energizing thought that we create in our mind when we see something, when we achieve something. From childhood we have been conditioned to depend our happiness on external things. For example-I would be happy when I buy my dream car.I would be happy when I am able to buy my own home.I would be happy when I marry this girl. The list goes on and on. We achieve the object/objective, we get happy for a short while and then set another goal saying I would be happy when I achieve that. We forget that these objects and achievements do not give us happiness. We create happiness in ourself when we achieve these objects. If your dream car had the power to create happiness, it would create same happiness in everyone. But this does not happen because the car does not create happiness. We create the thought of happiness by looking at the car. People who are happy at all times have understood that the power to be happy lies within them. Happiness is a choice, a daily decision. It should have nothing to do with your goals and achievements. You choose-I will be happy when I achieve this. orI will be happy while I achieve this.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"This is a tough one. I would ideally prefer some more information before answering this question. How old are you? How old is your brother? What is the relationship between you otherwise?Your strategy depends on the outcome you want. The way you see your brother and the way he is treats you (from your perspective), things do not look too good. If you do not want to improve your relationship, then carry on doing what you are doing. You can be rest assured that the future would not be too great between both of you. You can decide to be more aggressive as well if you do not mind the relationship to go further sour. You can tell him that you are an individual and he cannot rule you. You can walk out on him. You can refuse to talk to him till he mends his ways.But if you want your relationship to improve, your strategy has to be very different. Then you need to step back and analyse as a third party- - What are you doing? Why are you doing that? Can you do something differently?- What is he doing? Why is he doing that? What is his intention? May be he feels responsible for you, maybe he feels that you are not fulfilling your responsibility and he wants you to grow into a good individual. Maybe he means your good in whatever he is doing. His way might not be the best, but his intentions might be good. Human behaviour is like an iceberg, what you see is only the tip. Under the behaviour there are values, thoughts, feelings and emotions. You need to understand the underlying thoughts for yourself and for your brother.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you for asking!There are two aspects to knowing yourself-1. The way you behave with others2. The way you think and feelThe two are related very well. The way you think and feel guides how you behave with others. And the way you behave with others tells you how you think. So understanding any one of them can give you insight about the other. And once you have the insights, you can work on it. Below are certain ways of developing a better understanding of yourself-1. Introspection as Bharat suggested. It helps you understand your thoughts and associated feelings. We are what we think. Once you get the idea of your thoughts, you can modify them to change your behaviour. An example of this in one of my answer here - Arti Gupta's answer to How can I turn a horrible day into a better one? and here Arti Gupta's answer to What does it feel like to have anger issues? 2. Meditation - This would help you introspect better. 3.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Do you love your mother? Do you live with her? In all probability you love your mother and you must not be living with her right now. How are you able to live without your mother if love means having someone with you, in your life at all times? Love actually does not mean having someone. Love means just loving that person, keeping them in your heart and feeling nice every time you peep inside your heart and look at them. We do that for our parents when we move away from them, we can definitely do it for others as well. So what do you need to do to achieve this stage? 1. Change your outlook towards love - Understand that love is not about having someone with you, it is about working towards their happiness, it is about nurturing someone in your heart. 2. Understand that you are responsible for the misery you are feeling. Incidents happen around us, but how we feel after them is our decision. So tell yourself, ""I am creating this misery in my mind and I can change the way I feel"". 3. We create thoughts in our mind and these thoughts lead to the way we feel. Currently your thoughts might be on these lines-- She has left me again. - I am devastated.- She used me. - She is bad or maybe I am not worth it.You are either cursing her or hampering your self esteem. Change your thoughts to these-- I am thankful for 5 years I have spent with her. - I am glad I got someone to share my life with for all these years, many people never realise what love is.- I have learnt so much from this relationship. - I would love to have her longer in my life, but maybe we were meant to be together for 5 years only. - I hope she is happy because that is what I want. - I love her and I would always be there for her. - She must have had her reasons to move on.

We all know about old age and the issues associated with it, but seeing them in front of my eyes changed my perspective towards life completely. I learned-1. Taking care of myself - It is good to take care of work, husband and kids. But one should not lose the perspective that one has responsibility towards oneself too. I make sure I exercise my mind and body. I am regular in yoga and focus more on areas of my body that are prone to old age issues.2. Drop expectations from kids- Expectation from people, even your own give hurt. Kids would always love parents, but they might not be able to express it in words and actions. So, do not expect and make their life complicated. I tell myself a few things-I got kids because I wanted them. Whatever I do for them, is part of my responsibility and love for them. I am fulfilling my need to be a mother by having them, so I am not doing any obligation on them by taking care of them.3. Have a life of my own - I need to keep my passion in life alive. They would leave one day and then I would not know where to start. 4. More acceptance for my husband - One day we both would retire and would be at home. It is crazy to have someone all day with you.

So to begin with, just relax, world is not coming to an end even if they come to your place while you are there. There is worst that can happen in one's life. Tell yourself that you can deal with it, even if the worse happens. Now coming to your options-1. They visit your city, but do not stay with you - Patricia has already suggested some ways. I am not sure what culture you come from and how feasible it is for you to avoid their staying at your place. For me personally, it is obvious that my sibling would stay with me. They would change their plan to suite my calendar. This is how the culture goes. 2. They stay at your home with you not being there - I would really not consider this one if I were you. I would never leave someone I am not comfortable with in my space without me. 3. They cancel their plan - You might tell them that you are busy and make some excuse so they cancel their plan. But that would only postpone your issue. You would be thinking about another strategy 6-9 months down the line. 4. The visit your city and stay with you while you are there - What about this option? For how long would you be able to avoid your siblings? Looking at your description, it looks unlikely that you would tell them what you think of them in clear words. You are too polite for that. So what about working on things that are in your ""Circle of control""? If I were you, I would do the following-Tell myself that if they are jealous, it is their problem and not mine. Tell myself that they deserve my compassion instead of dislike. They have so much negativity inside them, it must be paining them to see that I am so well off. What should I do with person who is in pain? Approach that person with compassion. Tell myself that I have to do this for my mother as I love my mother so much. Tell myself that this is a challenge life has given to me and I am going to sail with flying colours. Tell myself that few days with them would be a huge learning experience. Having said that, I would write a list of things that are negotiable and non-negotiable for me while they are there. This would help me put my feet down, when the need arises. For example, I have to study 8 hours a day and I would not compromise on that. I would meditate a bit before they come so that I prepare my mind to be more resilient. Your options are all there.... Take your pick.All the best!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Hello MattThank you for asking. I am writing this answer after reading the details and the comment thread for Say Keng Lee's answer. When I read your question, my first thought was ""People do not agree because it is not true"". And then I read other details, so here is my take-1. Hard work is a prerequisite, nothing works without it. 2. I believe that apart from hard work, successful people have a positive attitude that makes them see opportunities which others miss. There was actually a research conducted on this by Richard Wiseman. Below link talks about his method and findings. Be lucky - it's an easy skill to learnPage on richardwiseman.com3. Coming to your examples of various people, I believe they would have done something whatever era they would have been born in. Steve Jobs might not have created ""Apple"", he might have created something else, who knows. A simple exercise that I have done-We all have faced trouble finding a taxi in peak hours or a parking space. We approach the parking and our self talk goes like this (for most of us)-1. I am sure I would not get the parking. 2. It is such a pain to get parking here. 3. Last time I came it took me 15 minutes. I am sure it would take me long today also. No prize for guessing what happens; we find it hard to get parking. I changed my self talk to this-1. I am sure I would be lucky. 2. I know I would get the parking. And guess what, I do get a parking most of the time when I think positive. As funny as it may sound, it works. - Successful people are positive, they think positive and attract positive results. - Because of their positivity they spot opportunities better than unsuccessful people. And we call them lucky :).",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"It does not matter whether you can drag her to the court or not. Bigger questions are - Why do you want to do that? What are you going to get by it? There are several reasons that come to my mind-- You want to punish her for pain she has caused to you- You feel you love her and still want to marry her- You are obsessed about her and want her at any costYour probable rewards for taking her to court-Monetary compensation for damages - What would you do with money? Is it important for you?Success in forcing her to marry you - What would you get if she does end up marrying you? You would get either a living dead body or an injured lioness. I do not need to tell you that your life is ruined in both the cases. You would only cause pain to yourself and everyone around you. Step back if you have loved her even for a moment. Btw, I saw in one comment that you still love her and you believe that she loves you too. I really do not think that you love her. When we love people we nurture them, we do not take them to court. Courage and maturity is in moving on without burning the bridges. All the best!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Nice to read your question and see your self awareness. Jeremiah Azurin has already given you some suggestions to connect with people abroad. I would give you some thoughts-1. Thinking whether your decision was wrong or right is not going to help you. It would only make you miserable. Look ahead in life and make the most of it. 2. Accept that missing family is fine. We struggle when we fight with our feelings and try to resist them. It is fine to miss your family. Tell yourself that you do not miss them actually, you miss being with them. There is a slight difference in the two. When I say that I miss being with someone, I think of times I was with them and feel happy about it. Practice to be happy with the feeling of missing being with someone. Apart from this, you can do the following-1. Invest more time in developing one or two close relationships. This would help you sail better. 2. Practice mindfulness, this reduces undue stress we feel because of our thoughts and fears. 3. Think about the ideas Jeremiah has given you. Having a hobby and volunteering really helps. Hope that help!All the best and thank you for asking Cosi!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you Jean for asking and sorry for the delay in replying. It is a tough one. As Dixie Golden said, it is difficult for anyone to judge your situation and give you a firm advice. There are pearls of wisdom in Dixie's answer. I hope you would have been able to get some answers by reflecting on the thoughts there.Below is my take-Diagnosis of your situation - You need a good diagnosis of your current position in your ecosystem. You have certain way of looking at things, and a fresh perspective would help. 13 years is a long time in any industry. I am sure you would have met people you can trust. I suggest that you choose 4-5 trustworthy people across the chain and talk to them. Ask them what they feel about your situation. Ask them to tell you- 3 things that you are doing well and you should keep doing (this would give you a boost, something we need when things are not positive)- 3 things that you are doing and you should stop doing (this would tell you about habits you need to change)- 3 things that you should start doing (this would give you thoughts you are oblivious to)Even if you talk to 4 people, you would have 15-20 ideas to think about. I am sure that would give you a perspective. Hope this helps you.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"I understand that it is difficult for you to accept your son having a pony tail. It is important for you to look at your son and see the reflection of what you believe is right for a man his age. I am sorry to say but you have to realise that you really cannot do much about it. He is a separate individual. Being a parent does not mean that you own your kids. They have a separate mind, thoughts and identity. And love is about accepting people around us with their individuality. You can adopt strategy of emotional black mail that a lot of parents adopt. But that harms the relationship more than anything. Ask yourself just one question - What is more important for you - Your relation with him or his looking the way you want? - If his looks are more important, please go ahead ...there are 1000 ways of forcefully getting kids to do something. - If relationship is important, then accept him the way he is. Call him, hug him and tell him that you are sorry for nagging him  for his pony. Tell him that you love him for what he is and you value him in your life. You are blessed you have a son who can think and make his own decisions. Trust me, a lot of people would give anything to have a son like yours. Enjoy what you have!!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Indeed it is possible. We are what our thoughts are. We can change our feelings and emotions if we can change the underlying thoughts. This mind is a programmable entity. You can tag thoughts are useless, useful, positive, negative etc and influence the way you feel about life. An example here -Let us look at a horrible day-1. I wake up late for work as my alarm did not work. My first thought is ""It is going to be a super bad day. I have no time and there is so much to do""2. I get into the shower and the water is cold. I hate cold bath. And I am like, ""F*** I knew it, it is a bad day.""3. I have no time for breakfast, so I leave without having anything. 4. I get into my car and the tyre is flat. By now I am very irritable. I am certain that worse lies ahead. I get a cab and leave.5. I reach office and I am told that my boss had been looking for me. I know I have a major presentation today. By now I am certain that there is some challenge. 6. I meet my boss. There is a situation at office and he needs my suggestion on it. I am so exhausted and depleted by now that I have no energy left to think constructively. I obviously so not contribute positively to the discussion. 7. I come out cursing myself and waiting to see what lies ahead. Version 21. I wake up late for work as my alarm did not work. My first thought is ""Glad I woke up at least now. I still have time, I can manage it.""2. I get into the shower and the water is cold. I hate cold bath. And I am think, ""Oh! glad that water is there. What if water was not there."" Cold water ensures I finish quickly :). 3. I realise that I cannot be hungry, so I pick an apple/energy bar to eat at first opportune moment. 4. I get into my car and the tyre is flat. I take a deep breath and call for a cab. Thank God! Cab is here in time. I hop in happily, eat whatever I picked and reach office. 5. I am in a fine mood to give all ideas to my boss and things work well. 6. I come out of the cabin and get on with my work smiling and happy. It is all in the mind. We create energy with our thoughts. Our mind is powerful beyond our imagination. Create positive thoughts and positive energy from these thoughts would ensure that positive happens. I posted this example originally as part of answer to a question here - Arti Gupta's answer to How can I turn a horrible day into a better one?One more example of changing thoughts is here - Arti Gupta's answer to My girlfriend left me for the 2nd time in my 6th year of relationship for other boys. The first time she left me was when we were in the 3rd year. After 1 year, she came back in my life. I love her madly and I can't live without her. What should I do?Thank you for asking Hassan!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Some reasons for obsession - 1. Desire to own things we love - We find a dress in the market, we have the desire to own it. Similarly when we fall in love with a person, we want that person to be ours, only ours, and that leads to obsession. 2. Insecurity - Even when we get that person we feel insecure that we might lose him/her. There are several reasons of insecurity, but those are beyond the scope of this question. 3. Sense of entitlement - We feel that we are entitled to have that person. 4. Failure to recognise the difference between ""things"" and ""people"" - We fail to realise that we do not own people and that people need space to be happy.5. Lack of purpose in life - Many times we do not have a goal/purpose in life. Having feelings for someone fills that void and we fall deep in it. 6. Initial phase of knowing the person - Sometimes we are obsessed as it just the beginning of the relationship. We learn to calm down as time passes by. Some actions -1. We call on the person 10 times a day to check where they are. 2. We feel sky would fall if we do not hear from them. 3. We read their mail/message again and again.4. We keep thinking about our last meeting(s) with the person.5. We keep imagining the future meetings in our mind. 6. Our conversations revolve around talking about them. 7. Even with a voice notification on our phone, we pick our phone again and again to check a message from them.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Thanks for A2A!However good a communicator one is, there is always a chance of being misunderstood because you do not have any control on how other person perceives what you are saying. For example - When you told your friend that you are glad she is going for the surgery, she could interpret it many ways like-1. Yes it is easy for you to say as you are not going to go under the scalpel. You are not sensitive to the risk of the surgery. Maybe you do not care. 2. You feel my pain and are happy that my pain would be finally over. So, a few things for you to remember-1. The way people interpret depends on their perspective in life, their perspective of you and their attitude in general. For example, once a friend got hurt. I gave her bandaid. I had many of them, so I offered her more since she was traveling. She immediately retorted, ""You want me to get more hurt"" :). I just kept mum.2. Different people would respond differently to the same thing and this is very important since that makes them different. Based on people's response to us, we understand whether we connect with them or not.What you can do still? 1. Start observing yourself more specifically on occasions where you were misunderstood by someone. See if others also misunderstand you in a similar situation or it is just this person. Change your strategy based on that. 2. Relax a little, we all make mistakes and learn. Sleep well if your intention was good :). 3. Do not seek anyone's approval. If they get you wrong, you can try to explain again. And if they still do not want to understand, it is their problem not yours. Different people have different interpretations of what is written in their religious literature as well. I am sure if PBUH Prophet Mohamed, Gautam Buddha, Jesus Christ, Lord Shiva, Lord Vishnu etc.come down again, they would be stunned at the interpretation of their teachings by some people.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Congratulations that you are aware to begin with. Awareness is the first step to change. Sorry to say, but both are a huge problem. Let us take them one by one -Perfectionism I have personally suffered from it for a long time. When I was a perfectionist, I used to be actually proud of it (maybe it gave me a bit of superiority complex as well that my standards are higher than others). Why is it bad?1. It takes away peace and happiness from life because there is nothing called perfect. You keep striving for it, but you never achieve it. It is difficult to be satisfied with one's own work as well as others'. 2. It has a huge possibility of impacting your relations with others negatively. Doing something perfect is important for you, but not for others. Working in teams becomes hard. They do not get your perspective and you do not get theirs. People think you are weird and vice versa. 3. A lot of times the amount of effort/time you put in to bring something from 90 percent to 95-97% perfection is not worth it. 4. It takes away the joy of living as you do not appreciate what you have and keep striving for something you cannot achieve. How to improve?   - Any behaviour change is a tough process, and so is this.Observe your behavior. Whenever you find yourself fretting over making something perfect, ask if it is worth it. Get an external perspective. Have someone close to you help you in this change. Make a diary of how many times you could let go of this need to be perfect in the day and how many times you could not. Having said that, not aiming for perfectionism does not mean you do shoddy work. IndecisivenessWe see this lack of decision making a lot around us.  This is a skill which needs to be practiced since one is a toddler. I am not going to get into why it is bad, since we all know it is bad. How to improve? - Start being conscious of decisions you make. What to eat in the morning? What to wear to work? What tie with shirt? Which socks? Which route to take to work? What song to listen in the car? Which coffee to pick? How much to talk to someone you meet at office? How to respond to emails? What to work on first at office? These are simple decisions, but we all make them every day. Start being aware of your decisions. And you would see you would improve. BonusUrge you to check out ""Marshmallow challenge"" on the net. It is a challenge where teams are made to balance a marshmallow at the top of spaghetti. Kids do much better at this challenge than adults since they do not think. They make fast decisions and learn from their mistakes. MBAs do the worst as they keep thinking about strategy (if i recollect it well). This might inspire you to just take the plunge into decision making and not to strive to be perfect in the first go.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"I think Eivind Kjørstad has talked about cultural aspect, so I would not get into it. How people perceive relationship between opposite gender is a factor of culture to a large extent. Should you or should you not explain to them to clear the assumptions? It is completely up to you. - If you think in your culture, being linked to someone is not good, and you care about your impression, you may choose to clear their assumptions.- If you think in your culture, being linked to someone is not good, but you do not care about your impression, you may choose not to bother about clearing their assumptions. - If you think in your culture, being linked to someone is fine, then whether you want to clarify or not might depend on the person they are linking you to.  If I am linked to someone I like and my culture is tolerant, I would not bother, I would enjoy it :). - If you think in your culture, being linked to someone is fine, but you are linked to a person you do not admire much, you might want to clear all assumptions so that your prospects of linking with someone else are open.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you for asking Dominic!I would agree with Aryan Thappar.. first question is Why would you like to do it? How important it is for you to do it? What would you get by doing it? What do you lose by not doing it? Start by writing answers to these questions. They seem simple. but they would help you understand the importance of the new skill/subject in life. After doing this, you might decide there is nothing to lose and I do not want to pursue. And just in case you want to pursue it, go ahead and read rest of my answer. I would share a personal experiences. 1. Swimming - I missed out learning it as a kid. Lived 37 years of my life without going to a pool. It was always on mind, but it never happened. Then I had kids, they started swimming and they would always ask me. I reflected and realised that I was missing out on the pool fun with kids. They are so fond of fish like any other kids, so I talked to them about Scuba diving. They got so fascinated by it. I had a vision of scuba diving with them one day. So, I got my strong reason. I enrolled myself to a class. I was so scared that I would make a fool of myself in the pool. So I watched as many videos I could about swimming for starters. I joined classes, 3 classes were good and then I reached a chasm. My instructor could not help me cross it. I found a new teacher, did not like him in first class, so never went again. I found a third teacher who was amazing and I finally learned how to swim. My learning from this-You need a strong reason to give you a will.You need a very good teacher.2. History - I grew up hating this subject as I was more inclined to Math and Science. I still remember how I danced when I gave my last exam of History. I almost threw the books out of the house. After I grew up I realised that it is important to know about history to a certain extent. I found myself completely ignorant when people would discuss it. So, I picked up some interesting books on history. I picked up, ""Major events that changed the world"". I watched movies on world wars. Watching a movie on a subject I did not like was better than reading a book. I am nowhere a master of history, but I know a bit at least. My learning from this-You again need a reason to learn.Having someone tell you makes it more interesting that reading yourself.Fortunately we live in a world of knowledge. There is so much of it out there. And some people have done a great job of making subjects interesting. Like Paul G. Hewitt changed the way I looked at physics The Philosophy Book made philosophy easy for meThe Religions Book gave me a good understanding of religions, something I would have never read otherwiseFind an interesting representation of the material you want to learn. This might not give you the expertise, but it would help you take first step. I believe that everything can be made interesting, we just need a reason from within to learn it and then we need a good teacher. That is my personal take...Hope that helps!Regardsarti",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you Jose for asking the question and for your clarifications in the comments. So, there are two issues here-1. Failing at your first job has impacted your self esteem. 2. The report of your brain necrosis in playing on your mind and further making it difficult for you to lead a normal happy life. I am not a trained therapist but I would try to give my thoughts. I would suggest the following for you - 1. Make your achievements diary - Take a nice diary and start writing your achievements. Close your eyes and imagine you are 6 years old. What is the achievement that you remember? Write simplest stuff that you remember, stuff that was big for you at that point in time. For e.g.I stood against the class bully todayI do not like playing but I made a goal in soccerI am anxious to speak with people, but I went and spoke to x person. I stood up for myself in the class. I am one of the 9 people who have received this therapy. I have been able to beat deathI graduated well in spite of all oddsI got a jobMy boss appreciated me that dayI helped someoneI am a good sonWrite as many things as you can, one on each page. Paste pictures if you have. 2. Things that make me special poster - You mentioned that you have family and friends who care for you. Ask each of them to tell you two things that make you special. Write all these things in big font with colourful pens on the poster. Paste that poster in your room. Read that poster once every hour. 3. Understand failure - Failure is not in failing; failure is in believing that you can never succeed. J.K. Rowling faced rejection from 12 publishing houses before Harry Potter was published. Imagine what would have happened if she had stopped after first few failures. Abraham Lincoln lost 8 elections and failed twice in business before he saw success.source - megafounderHenry Ford's first two automobile companies failed.Beethoven lost his hearing during his career, yet he managed to produce great music. Marilyn Monroe was dropped by 20th Century Fox saying that she was not beautiful and she could not act. You have lived a life of fighting and winning over your physical condition. You have had one disappointment. Take it as a lesson and move ahead. 4. Understand the power of mind - I am not sure if you realise, but both your issues are in your mind. Mind is amazing, it can create endless challenges, the good news is that all solutions are within our mind as well. We only have to talk to our mind. Mind is like a wild horse, roaming in the jungle of thoughts. We have to find a way to tame this horse. Mind has thoughts all the time and the way we see ourselves and the world depends on these thoughts. This is such a subtle process that we do not even realise it's existence. Good new is that if we change these thoughts, we can change the way we feel. An example of this is here Arti Gupta's answer to How can I turn a horrible day into a better one?So you need to find a way to have a positive conversation with your mind and not indulge in negative thoughts. We all have little doubts in our mind about our ability, but some of us fuel these thoughts more than others. Imagine if I tell you, ""Jose you are good for nothing"". What would be your reaction? In all probability, you would want to slap me. Now when your inner voice doubts your capability, why do you call that voice on a tea party? Realise that you are the creator of your thoughts and your emotions. Every thought you have in your mind is your choice. So make good choices that are beneficial for you by creating positive thoughts. 4. Practice mindfulness - Most of the time our bodies live in present, while we indulge in our past or future. Learn to live with your body, in present. This would reduce your anxiety. A good starting point can be Headspace. It has some videos and some guided practices to get you going. 5. Learn something new - Be a students again, learn something new - language, sports, or anything else. Learning creates a lot of positivity in our lives. Hope that helps.

Arti-Gupta-1,"I agree with Joyce Fetteroll. I think she has answered your question brilliantly. People have different needs and wants. They look for answers of their specific situations. And complainers do not look for solutions. What is that you are looking for? Are you looking to pick some of that need/want and develop a service/solution around it? I am really not aware of any such single place if your objective is that. - I agree with Isaac Wai Wong that a good starting point would be to ask yourself of your needs and wants. - Another way is to look around yourself and be observant. Ability to identify a gap is a key skill that separates entrepreneurs from non-entrepreneurs. Two people can look at the same situation and one can spot the gap whereas the other would not. Some people just have it in them. A lot of successful people were not able to identify that right gap first time. They made mistakes and learnt. - I agree with you that a lot of time people do not think about what would make their life easier. So you ask that question. Think of random people around you and see what would make their life easier. Start writing your ideas. Are you looking to build a portal where people can talk of their needs/wants and others can help them? Currently there are different portals catering to different needs people have. Like there are health portals, baby advice, relationship advice, getting finance for your project etc. In this case you would have to look at your niche and then get going.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Hello dear I understand how you feel. I started questioning myself when I was 28. Successful career and money did not give me kick anymore.  First 40 years of your life you focused on what society told you was the path to happiness. You did well, you lived a life that people would die for, and you realized that you still felt empty inside.   Now starts a new phase of your life, a more fulfilling one. I see that you are into a lot of things already like mindfulness, some hobbies, and a project for social cause to fill this emptiness. I agree with Quora User that you are on the right path in life. The path to find meaning is difficult, but worthwhile. The answers are within you and you need to find them. I would just following that might help you.  Take note of your mental chatter – Our mind keeps talking all day and a lot of time we do not even realise it. Maybe noting this mental chatter for 3-4 days would give you insights into discovering yourself. I do this exercise whenever I struggle to find answers in my life.  Have a sounding board– See if you have someone who can be your sounding board.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you Varun for asking. You made me really think. There are some valid answers here. I agree that traveling, education, marrying the person of your choice etc helps, but then how do I explain the courage my grandmother exhibited? My grandmother and great grandmother did not travel the world, did not go to school beyond primary, and certainly did not marry the man of their choice. But they had the courage I doubt I have; they had the strength I doubt I have; they felt they were more free than probably what I feel. What gave them the strength to stand and take on the world? My take-Responsibility from childhood - They both contributed and supported their families as kids. When we give responsibility to kids, they develop their ability to handle situations and become strong in the process. Freedom to make decisions - Their parents trusted them to make decisions on their own very early on. Every good decisions builds confidence and wrong decision makes one learn.Acceptance - Maturity to accept their surroundings and not have unrealistic desires never made then feel that they were not free. They felt that they had the freedom to do whatever they wanted as their wants were realistic. So I believe that whether I as a woman feel strong and independent or not is a factor of my upbringing and my thought process.",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you for A2A!There is a lot of good advice here on what you should do when you are low. So, I would focus more on accepting the situation. I read this long back... maybe this would help you accept that people come and go. Once you accept this, you would be at peace. People always come into your life fora REASON, a SEASON, or a LIFETIME.When you figure out which it is, you know exactly what to do. When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed outwardly or inwardly. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, or to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or even spiritually. They may seem like a godsend too you, and they are. They are there for a reason...you need them to be. Then, without any wrong doing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die, Sometimes they just walk away. Sometimes they act up or out and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled; their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and it is now time to move on.When people come into your life for a SEASON, it is because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They may bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it! It is real! But, only for a season. And like Spring turns to Summer and Summer to Fall, the season eventually ends.LIFETIME relationships teach you a lifetime of lessons; those things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person/people (anyway);, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas in your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant. Thank you for being part of my life.....A Reason, A Season, and A Lifetime written by:Brian A.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Being unconditional means that you do everything without any condition, irrespective of the external environment. For example-I love someone whether he loves me or not. I would do anything for this person even if this person does not reciprocate my feelings, or maybe he does not reciprocate with the same intensity. For example, I cook for him even if he never appreciates my cooking (and that never bothers me). I am always there for him, come what may. Why is it difficult?We have been trained to have following traits-1. Reciprocity - Give what you get. 2. Expectation in relationships - Our parents tell us again and again that they expect this and that from us. When we do not deliver, they are disappointed and somewhere it reflect in their care for us (at least momentarily). Now when I expect someone to do something and the person does not deliver, I reciprocate in similar way (by not doing). I feel I am justified to do that.Another issue is that we live in time of superficial relationships. ""True love is a prerequisite to being unconditional"". I wrote about love here Arti Gupta's answer to What is love? When do you know it's forever?Only when you have this kind of love, you can be unconditional. Otherwise it is all about give and take. And thats my take :)",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Thanks for A2A!I would suggest that you practice the following to start with-1. Make the conversation about the other person, ask questions - Everyone loves to be the centre of attraction, so keep the other person at the centre of your conversation. You can ask them questions like-What is keeping you busy these days?Work related questionsTell me more about what you do. You would either understand what they or you would have no clue. If you understand their work, asking more questions is easy. If you do not understand their work, acknowledge that you have not met many people who are into something like this. You can then ask them questions like-What are the challenges in your work? How does a typical day looks like?What do you love about your work?Place related questionsWhat do you like about living at this place?What is one thing that you would change about this place?Where can I find best xyz?The idea is to start by asking, and when you would ask you would get starting point. But please do not make it like an interview. 2. When they answer, listenI see that others have talked about listening as well. It is one of the most underrated skill. Most people I know are bad listeners. I understand listening, but I am also bad at times. Listening involves attention and silence of mind that we rarely get. If you listen well, you would definitely be able to ask more relevant questions and make your conversation interesting. 3. Read moreReading gives us knowledge and breadth of perspectives. Try and read as much as you can. 4. Call people by nameThis is cliched, but very useful. Everyone loves the sound of their name and they listen to you more when you call them by their name. 5. Observe othersWhen you are around people, observe how they strike conversation with others. Be an active observer. 6. Join a groupJoin some networking club etc so you get to practice more. There is no substitute of practice. 7. Have a goalGive a goal to yourself that you would strike a conversation with x number of people/week. Reward yourself when you meet that goal and punish when you do not. I am serious about the latter part. You can think of something simple like - If I do not meet the goal for the week, I would not eat chocolate for next whole week (if you like chocolates).It is good to have humour, but I would forget about it for the time being. That is a goal at a later stage. I do hope that it helps you. All the best!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"Daniyal Ali, thank you for asking me this question, for replying to my comments and for this link - Rise Of The Modern Commitment Phobic ManI frankly just skimmed through the article. This article depicts men as monsters who are ready to lay women, have fun and shake their hands off when the time comes to commit. I am surprised to see that the article is written by a man. Anyways, to each their own. I personally do not subscribe to this article. - Declining marriages does not mean that men are irresponsible. - Playing playstation @ 30 also does not mean men are irresponsible.- Phobia to commit does not imply that they are irresponsible. MarriageMarriage is a relation between two people. If dynamics of marriage have changed over years, we cannot blame one party for it. We as women need to do some soul searching and ask ourselves some tough questions. We went on a bandwagon of men-women equality. We forgot that men and women are made to complement each other, not compete with each other. We got into the skin of this 21st century woman who wants to be equal to her man. We started competing with him.- Why should I do all house work as I am tired like you after a day's work. - Why should I only take care of kids. It is your turn to change the diaper. Why would a man marry his alter ego? It is obvious that men would be scared to commit. ResponsibilityRunning away from marriage is in no way running away from responsibility. I believe men today are as responsible as his forefathers. When I look around, I cannot find a single man I can tag as ""irresponsible"". Today men work well at office as well as home, their forefathers worked only at office.

Arti-Gupta-1,"Thank you for asking. Your situation is complex. I am not sure if I could help, but I would try. Like Tim Dawes, I admire your effort to reflect and reach out in this situation. Many people might have preferred to get in their own shell. Tim has already given you a perspective. Before I go deeper, I feel I would like to know more. How old are you now? What kind of jobs your parents do? How much time do they get at home? How many siblings do you have? To answer your question - It is absolutely possible to go dull on your parents. Is it okay? I do not know. Your side of the story appears really difficult to manage, so I would not judge. But probably an approach could be to understand your parents, to see the world from their eyes. The behaviour you see is only top of the iceberg (very small part of their story). There are underlying values, thoughts, feelings and emotions. Are you aware of these feelings? Are you aware of what they are going through? Going dull is easy, but would you be proud of it 20 years later? If not, then try seeing the world from their perspective. Their side of the story might increase your self awareness or you might realise that they need your help more than anything else. All the best!",mid,high,high,low,low
Arti-Gupta-1,"A few activities that we do-1. Give them a letter and ask them to tell a place with that letter and one fact about that place. If they cannot tell, they have resources to research. For example - Letter S, if they say Switzerland then they tell one fact about Switzerland. 2. Ask them to explain anything. For example, I asked them to explain Cauliflower and they said - Cauliflower is like a brain on a stick, or it is like the coral reef. Sets their imagination going. 3. What comes to your mind when you think of a particular word. The whole family plays and everyone takes turn to say the word that comes to their mind listening to word from previous player. This gives a good peek in their mind and gets them to think quickly.4. Quiz like - Ask them to name countries starting with a particular letter. Logos when we are on the roadBrands of coffee shops, phones, TVs etcGive them a fact about any animal and they have to guess the animal. Name any animal and say how many facts can you tell about that animalWord jumble5. New words and their meaning - Have them make a notepad where they write every new word they come across. It is amazing how many words they suddenly start adding. 6. Ask then questions instead of telling them anything. What do you think you should be doing? What are the options? What would happen if x,y option was chosen. 7. While watching TV, discuss characters. Ask them their view on who is the real hero of the story. What did X character do right? What they would have done in that character's place?8. Mental maths - Simple questions to get them thinking.I cannot think of more right now.

Arti-Gupta-1,"To me having a Spiritual attitude means “inward living”. (It definitely does not mean that one becomes greedy.) Inward living means one reflects on questions like- What am I doing? Why am I doing it?What is materialism giving me?What do I really want in life?If I die tomorrow, would I repent not doing something?Am I really happy with the way my life is?What gives me peace?Am I doing enough to get that peace?How have I grown as a person over years?Am I living a reactive or responsible life?Do I control myself or others control me?Am I doing enough to grow myself, am I responsible towards myself?How does my mind feel?Do I think positive or negative? Am I doing anything for the negative?Do I accept myself? Am I at peace with myself?Do I fear something? Do I need to take a step to remove that fear?Do I blame others or take responsibility?What kind of choices have I made in life? How they have impacted others? When you travel a mm inward, you travel a cm closer to people.

So every student was contacting the invigilators almost every minute asking questions. The invigilators were staffs of the school with minimal knowledge of the subject/content asked in the exam. Students were asking the invigilator to call the IIT-JEE representative who was appointed for that center, but probably he was busy handling similar issues in other rooms. And there was I with my head down, giving least amount of attention to the class and trying to solve the questions as if my life depends on it. An then there was this question which (later faced reasonable controversy) had the following image with it. One of the two semi-circles was supposed to be shaded, but it was pretty unclear in the poorly printed image. Since it was a printing error I thought the invigilators will be able to help (may be only my paper had that error). So I raised my hand and one of the invigilators came to me, rather reluctantly almost prepared with his answer. Me: Sir, I need some help, the shaded part is not clear.He: (involuntarily) I don't know anything about this, I teach French.Me: OK then, ""la shaded partie ne est pas clair"".He chuckled and moved swiftly to call the representative from IIT-JEE.

Pratik-Jha-3,"On 15th August 2011, when most of the Arsenal fans were moaning about the loss of the prodigal son, the Captain Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona, that day a 16 year old unknown teenager joined Arsenal as  a part of the same deal. Today we know him as Hector Bellerin. Today on current form he is one of the most promising full backs the beautiful game can expect.  Lets see what makes him so good.Pace, Pace and some more Pace: Let's address the elephant in the room first, Hector Bellerin is fast, he is bloody fast. He famously beat Theo Walcott’s record sprint time for 40m at Arsenal, reportedly running it in 4.42s.If true, that means Bellerin is capable of running at about 32.4km/h,  and there are very few players in the modern day football who can match that. Look at this run by Bellerin in the 90th minute of the game against Bayern Munich, to set-up Mesut Ozil for the Goal (almost). https://streamable.com/7kb2Attacking abilities: This is the world of modern day football, where fullbacks not only defend but also make contribute significantly to attack. The Wingers have started to drift inside the pitch and gives the opportunities to fullbacks to make forward attacking runs. This is where Bellerin gets his edge. There are surely many Right backs who are defensively better than Bellerin, there aren’t many better than him going forward. In fact, in terms of numbers, the Spainiard is up there in term of creating chances in the europe's top five leagues. Lack of quality full-backs: Jamie Carragher once said, ""A fullback now a days is either a failed winger, or a failed Center Back. No one wants to be a Garry Neville."" Let's face it, todays football lacks quality fullbacks, players who can help out the Centerback when he is out of place, make forward runs into space and deliver quality crosses. The days to Cafu, Lilian Thuram, Gianluca Zambrotta are gone. The likes Lahm, Danny Alves, Zabaleta are at the tail ends of their peaks. The stage is set for Bellerin to rise above the Azpilicuetas, the Auriers, the Danilos, the Darmians and become the best in his trade.Fitness & Character: As you can expect from a 20 year old, Bellerin is super fit. He can run the length of the pitch for whole of 90 minutes and then run some more in the 91st.He had a torrid debut in the Chapions league against Borussia Dortmund where Arsenal lost 2-0 and the teenager had to take some blame. But the way he has bounced back from that shows that he more than a pair of fast legs with a solid engine.So, Hector Bellerin has all the abilities for a brilliant modern day full back. All he has to do now is keep his feet on the ground (which he will), stay consistent, stay hungry, stay fit (very crtical for a Gunner).Credits for images, stats etc. Oscar Wood on Twitter , 6 reasons why Arsenal's Bellerin will be the best right-back in the world , Arsenal news: Hector Bellerin is officially quickest player ever at the club, and he shows no sign of slowing down",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"So two very interesting parallels one can draw form Indian and Greek mythology (I have specifically taken the Mahabharata and the Iliad into account).  Similarities with Achilles heelSimilarities between Achilles and Karna Similarities with Achilles heelThe Achilles heel is a term which donates an area of weakness. Achilles was a great warrior who was washed with water of river styx to become invincible. His mother Thetis held him by his feet and dipped him into the river. The river washed of every body part of his except his feet. And ultimately his feet was where he got hit by a poisonous arrow and died.In Mahabharata there is a similar story. Duryodhana, the elder son of the Kauravas was summoned by his mother as she wanted him to be invincible. He was to appear naked in front of her as everybody part that her mother would see of his would become invincible. But Lord Krishna conviced Duryoshana to atleast wear a loin cloth over his crotch as it would be indecent to appear naked in from of his mother. And thus in the battle field Bhima targets Duryodhana's thighs which were his weak point and eventually killed him.Similarities between Achilles and Karna Both in Indian and Greek mythologies, two characters, Karna and  Achilles, stand out dramatically, putting everyone else in the shade.  Can one imagine the Mahabharata without the valiant, stoic Karna or the  Trojan war without the brave Achilles? The interesting factor is the  common thread of destiny weaving through their lives, distinguishing  them from other heroes.A demigod, Karna was born to Kunti and the Sun  god. The unfortunate circumstances of his birth force the virgin Kunti  to abandon the baby. He is brought up by a charioteer, Adhiratha, and  his wife Radha, who shower their love on him. Born with a gold-plated  armour and earrings that would make him invincible, he grows up to be a  handsome lad, irresistibly drawn to the kshatriya tradition of warfare,  perhaps due to his kshatriya heritage. When Dronacharya, the teacher of  the Kaurava and Pandava princes, refuses to accept him as his student,  Karna seeks out the great Parashurama as his teacher and learns all  warrior skills. During the display of all the princes’ skills in  Hastinapur, Karna jumps into the arena uninvited and outshines even  Arjuna, prompting a delighted Duryodhana to crown him king of Anga, and  that is when his lineage is questioned by all. Yet a strong tie of  friendship binds Duryodhana and Karna, that endures till the end.  Achilles too is a demigod born of Thetis, a nymph, and King Peleus.  Thetis dips her infant son in the Styx river by holding him by the ankle  to grant him invincibility, but the heel remains untouched. Achilles  grows into a handsome, fierce warrior, striking fear in the hearts of  the mightiest of warriors.What is strange is that both Karna and  Achilles are drawn to a war which had little to do with them — Karna, as  he had sworn allegiance to his friend Duryodhana and Achilles, due to  his word given to Agamemnon, leader of the Greek army, to join the  entire Greek contingent against Troy. Karna is barred from  fighting by Kaurava patriarch Bhishma. It is only after the 10th day,  when Bhishma falls, that Karna is allowed to enter battle. On the other  hand, Achilles is insulted by Agamemnon over a slave girl Briseis and  withdraws from the battlefield, preferring to sulk in his tent. Later  when his cousin (or perhaps companion) Patroclus is killed by Hector,  the eldest prince of Troy, he burns for revenge and rejoins the war that  cheers the Greek warriors who had almost given up and were on the verge  of defeat.Fearing for his son Arjuna’s safety, Indra, king of gods,  comes disguised as a poor brahmin and begs Karna to give away his golden  armour and ear rings. Though he is warned in his dream by the sun god  not to give them away, Karna, a man of his word, slices them off and  hands them to Indra thus sealing his fate. Though he puts up a brave  fight with Arjuna, Karna’s loss of invincibility along with the other  curses result in his tragic end. Meanwhile, Achilles leads the  Greek army to the gates of victory but falls when a divine arrow shot by  Paris, prince of Troy strikes his heel, the only vulnerable part of his  body.Both these heroes perhaps fought for honour and glory. Though they  have left an indelible mark as legends, one can’t help admiring Karna  more for his unwavering loyalty and sincerity towards his friend  Duryodhana. He does come to know — both from Krishna and Kunti — that he  is the eldest born son, a Pandava by birth. Being a man of honour, he  refuses to switch sides, preferring to fight and die a warrior’s death.  “After all, mother,” he promises Kunti with a poignant smile, “your five  sons will live ultimately, either me or Arjuna, how does it matter?”And there is always  a affection from everybody for Achilles and Karna even though they were fighting for the ""wrong"" side in the war. They were like the right people in the wrong team.",high,high,high,high,low

Pratik-Jha-3,"I was surprised to know that not many people are aware of this, so decided to put this as an answer.You surely would have noticed that every train in Indian Railways has a number. But these number are not just random digits to designate the trains. There is a reason behind it. On December 20, 2010, IR switched to a system of 5-digit number system to make it uniform for everyone. So I'll be talking about that.The first digit          In the 5-digit train numbering scheme, the first digit indicates the type of the passenger train, as follows:	  	  	0 is for special trains (e.g., summer specials, holiday specials, etc.)1 is for all long-distance  trains, including the Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Jan Sadharan, Sampark Kranti,  Garib Rath, Duronto, and other classes.2 is also for long-distance trains; it is to be used when train numbers starting with 1 are exhausted in any series.3 is for Kolkata suburban trains. 4 is for suburban trains in Chennai, New Delhi, Secunderabad, and other metropolitan areas. 5 is for passenger trains with conventional coaches6 is for MEMU trains7 is for Diesel multiple unit and railcar services. 8 is currently reserved9 is for Mumbai area suburban trainsSecond and later digits          The significance of the second and later  digits depends on what the first digit is. Below, the different number  series are explained, based on the first digit.0, 1, 2:  In the case of special  trains, and long-distance express trains, i.e., trains starting with  digits '0', '1', or '2', the remaining 4 digits signify the railway zone  and division exactly as in the pre-2011 4-digit scheme. In fact, most  5-digit numbers for long-distance trains as of this writing [4/11] are  created simply by prefixing '1' to the former 4-digit codes. See below for an explanation of the 4-digit system.

Pratik-Jha-3,"First of all neither the books nor George R.R Martin has ye confirmed that Jon Snow is half Targaryen. The R+L=J, is still a fan theory, a very famous, mostly correct, but still a fan theory.R+L=J tells us that Ned stark,(as he remembers) after sacking of  Kings Landing went to Tower of Joy, to rescue Lyana Stark. He was accompanied by Howland Reed and 5 other men. They combated and defeated 3 Kingsgaurds including Ser Arthur Dayne. After defeating them Ned reaches into Lyanna's room seeing her drenched in her own blood, and Lyanna asked Ned for a promise to keep for life.After this Ned went to starfall (seat of House Dayne) to return Ser Arthur Dayne's legendary sword Dawn to his sister Ashara Dayne. (Some believe that Ashara Dayne is Jon's mother from Ned Stark)​Ser Arthur with Dawn.The R+L=J theory faithfuls (including me) believe that Lyanna died from Jon's birth and he was the promise. Now to show this story the show people can do a literal flashback (like the Cersie and Maggie the frog flashback she imagined). OR they can do a wierwood flash back.So Jon's lineage can be proved by Howland Reed, who was present at the tower of Joy. He is still alive in the books, somewhere in the North. And FYI he is father of Jojen and Meera ​ Or they can show it through some person whom Rhaegar Targaryen could have told that he is expecting a baby from Lyanna.

Pratik-Jha-3,"The story behind ""Ranchhod""Jarasandha, the king of Magadha, had married his daughters Asti and Prapti to Kamsa, Krishna's maternal Uncle. After Krishna killed his Uncle Kamsa, Jarashandh was furious with him. His daughters were widowed due to Krishna. He decided to teach Krishna and the Yadavas a lesson. Since the Yadavas were concentrated in and around Mathura, he decided to battle them and destroy the race forever. Jarasandha then repeatedly attacked Mathura and each time, he caused massive death and destruction. The seventeen attacks that he led on Mathura had sapped the energy of the Yadavas and stunted the growth of the city. The economy of the Yadavas was in  shambles and the wars had emptied the treasury. Jarasandha was a  powerful enemy with a huge army and the Yadavas barely managed to  withstand his attacks with even the likes of Krishna and Balarama on their side.Later King Jarasandha had joined forces with many major Kingdoms around Mathura, all aimed at the doom of Yadavas. These included Emperor Damghosha of Chedi, Dantavakra of Karusa, Rukmi of Vidarbha and  the brothers Vind and Anuvinda of Avanti.There was more disturbing news for the Yadavas. The Kingdom of Hastinapur expressed helplessness in coming to the aid of the Yadavas. Meanwhile, the alliance began its march towards Mathura. Thus the Yadavas were left forlorn and at the mercy of a huge force. Slowly the huge force of Jarasandha and co, started closing in towards Mathura. Krishna knew that he will not be able to defeat them due to sheer size of army they had. He then hit upon the idea of shifting the capital from Mathura to Dwaraka.Krishna placed the suggestion before King Ugrasena, his grandfather.Ugrasena and all other courtiers and even  the commanders of the Yadava army were against flight. Balarama too was  against the move. He wanted to fight against Jarasandha.Urgasena then pointed out to Krishna that if he ran away from battle field, he would forever be known as a Ranchhod or ""one who had run away from a battle field"".To this Krishna arguedthat he had no worry about any new name being given to him. “I  already have many names and one more does not make any difference”, he  said. Moreover, ""I am willing to sacrifice my reputation for saving my  people and their lives”.Balram was adamant on fighting, to whichKrishna gently reminded him that war is not the solution all the problems. He said the confederacy of  kings against Mathura is so great that it would lead to the death of countless people. “Why should people suffer because of me  and Balarama”, he asked the gathering. He then suggested that the best  solution would be leave the city and go to a new place where it would be  difficult for Jarasandha to attack them.The gathering reluctantly accepted the suggestion to leave Mathura. Though everyone was skeptical, how are they going to build a city so quickly as the rival army was at their gates. This is when to Krishna's help came Vishwakarma, the Architect of Gods. On being asked how much time it shall take him to build the city, he replied that city has already been built, under water. And with the permission of the Kings he would raise the city above the sea water. Everyone When all the Yadavas unanimously give their consent, the capital was shifted to Dwaraka. When Jarasandha and his army reached Mathura, they were met with an empty city. An enraged Jarasandha put the city to destruction and called Krishna Ranchhod (Ran= Battlefield, Chhod= Leave). And since then the name stayed.Krishna was unfazed by the new name, as he knew he saved many lifes by avoiding that war. Later Krishna bided his time and several years later, led Bheema and Arjuna to Magadha where Jarasandha wrestled with Bheema for 27 days before being killed. There is a very beautiful temple in Dakor, Kheda district Gujrat, which of the name ""Ranchhodrai Dakor Temple"". It has a Idol of Krishna in black stone, and thus keeps this legend alive.

Pratik-Jha-3,"If you are an Indian, ask yourself these question, When was the last time you booked a table before going to a restaurant?Have you ever preferred/ill-favoured a select table in any restaurant?Whenever you are discussing a restaurant, how much do you discuss aspects other than food, like ambiance, music etc. ?From May to July 2015, I have been working for a Restaurant based startup in Mumbai, I had gone to about 100 restaurants and only once I had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table. (couple of times I had booked a table in advance on suggestion of people)So coming back to your question, I have always felt that a start-up has to fundamentally solve a problem. An e-commerce website saves you the effort and cost of going to the market. A cab start-up saves the effort of going to the main road for a cab, breaks the syndicate of cab drivers in many places. But as start-up that is about booking a table in a restaurant does not solve a problem, because there is no such problem. Only a few section of consumers book a table in advance, and that process is also, only a phone call away after you get the contact from Zomato, or Google or Facebook, etc. The purpose of going to a restaurant for majority of us Indians is only good food. Very rarely it is about the whole experience. Thus, we are not very selective about restaurants and cuisine. ""If we do not get a place in the Mughlai restaurant, we will go the next door Thai place and order Shahi Paneer.""  Though like many other things, the change is slowly coming, (probably ""the Quora crowd"" is seeing the bulk of the change)So a start-up that offers the complete experience of the restaurant, from a booked table of choice, to the select cuisine, to the drinks that go with the cuisine, the music matching the ambiance; is a very much ahead of its time and will take some time to be useful to Indian users.Referring to the follow-up in details; Probably Delhi and Mumbai are the first cities which will and are experiencing some need for a table booking system, with the people being more and more selective in the urban areas. Thus, Dineout did get a very good first movers advantage in their domain, plus they have offers as well, which are always welcome. They have a party space booking system too which is a very useful tool in mega-cities. Moreover, they have spent a chunk of resources on being visible on social media an thus creating a need for booking tables in advance and that is delivering them goods.Thanks  Sunit Jain, for the A2A.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"This is one of the better questions that i have lately come across.""The chemistry must be respected."" So says Walter White.As Shubham Upadhyay mentioned that Vince Gilligan learned about the chemistry of crystal meth from the DEA and other scientific advisers. So there was a very serious effort to get the chemistry right.The first chemistry that comes to mind is the cooking crystal meth (Methamphetamine). The crystal meth Walt makes is understood to be unusually pure and also  has a characteristic delicate blue color. This is a useful device for  the narrative but generally the color of a crystal does not suggest a  pure or impure chemical compound. Impurities in minerals such as quartz  crystal can lead it to look pink (rose quartz) or violet (amethyst) but  generally the color is a result of the way the electrons in the  substance absorb light and is not a specific indicator of purity. So a crystal meth of blue color and the purity as shown in the book can be surely attained from a small scale process. The Poisonous gas:In one scene, in their makeshift mobile meth lab out in the desert, Walt  is being threatened by two gangsters. He improvises a method to gas  them by throwing red phosphorus into hot water. Walt manages to run out,  locking the gangsters in. He later explains to Jesse that this reaction  produced poisonous Phosphine gas. The small error is that Phospine gas cannot be formed just by warm water and Red Phosphorous. It can be formed using boiling water white phosphorous. Red phosphorous when reacted with very basic water can form Phosphine gas, according to the following reaction:3KOH + P4 + 3H2O → 3KH2PO2 + PH3 Reaction of red phosphorus and hydrogen can produce phospine, but it will be a voilent reaction.The dissolving bathThe first of the total 271 death was of Emilio. But the major problem was disposing him. Walt uses his Chemistry brain and suggestsHydrogen fluoride. Hydrogen Flouride can surely eat though almost everything except PTFE or Teflon. But according to my estimation the amount of Hydrogen Flouride found in School laboratories can not eat though a whole bath tub and a roof.The makeshift batteryIn another desert scene, Walt and Jesse are ""cooking"" but when they need  to drive home, they find the car battery is dead. Walt makes an  improvised and very basic battery out of acid, different metals and  wires and explains the chemistry to Jesse. If you put two different  metals in an acid (or even electrolyte solutions such as sea water), the  difference in chemical reactivity between the metals produces a  voltage. It's a basic electrochemical cell. Anyone who had metal amalgam fillings as a child will recall the weird  sensation of accidentally getting a piece of aluminium sweet wrapper in  your mouth. The saliva was acting as the electrolyte solution. The metal  filling and foil were acting as the two different metals, and we were  being electrocuted by our very own mouth battery. Walt's explanation is  fairly accurate but unfortunately such a simple battery would only  provide a tiny amount of the power required to turn over an engine. So it was party correct.Fulminate of Mercury.Remember when Jesse has been swindled and beaten up by psychopathic gangster Tuco. Walt confronts Tuco in his office, offering him more crystals but insisting on being paid immediately. Tuco starts to get nasty but Walt has a plan. The bag of meth crystals  he has just given Tuco were in fact ""fulminate of mercury"". He throws a  crystal on the ground which detonates, creating an almighty explosion. Mercury fulminate is a very unstable and explosive compound that can only be safely made in very small crystals. Crystals larger than a few millimetres in size are very tricky to handle. Walt's crystals are rather large and a bag of them would not be stable  enough to walk around with and handle as we see in the show. They  would, however, theoretically create a very powerful explosion. But the shock wave form the initial blast would no doubt would have detonated the other crystals in the bag on  Tuco's desk. Even if Walt and Tuco would had miraculously survived the explosion,  they would not have been able to hear much for a long while.Burning out the lockWalt and Jesse burn out a lock in a heavy duty door to get access to an  industrial chemical store. Walt describes the process they are using -  the thermite reaction - to Jesse. Here you mix a metal oxide (for  example iron oxide) with a reactive metal powder (such as aluminium) and  it produces iron metal and aluminium oxide. The temperature of the  reaction is extremely high and can be used to weld train tracks together  or indeed burn out a lock. The science here is correct and accurately shown.The killer Ricin.Ricin, a toxic protein, infects cells, blocking their ability to  synthesize their own protein. Without cells making protein, key  functions in the body shut down; even in survivors, permanent organ  damage is often the result of ricin poisoning. It's a highly unpleasant  way to be poisoned: within six hours, according to the Center for  Disease Control, victims who have ingested ricin will feel  gastrointestinal effects like severe vomiting and diarrhea, which can  lead to serious dehydration. Then the ricin infects the cells of the  vital gastrointestinal organs as they pass through the body, leading to  the failure of the kidneys, liver, and pancreas. As shown in the show, there aren't any immediate symptoms, and indeed there can  be a significant delay before symptoms show themselves, up to a day or  two.For people already thinking about using it on someone (:P) another good news for you people, They is no antidote (yet) for ricin. There is one research in progression, Read here for more details.(Vaccine for ricin toxin developed at Detrick lab).The CDC's website states bluntly, ""There is no antidote for ricin  toxicity."" There are some steps you can take if you get to a hospital  immediately; for ingestion, a stomach pump can sometimes prevent the  ricin from reaching the rest of the gastrointestinal system at its full  force. But...that's about it, really. It can be extracted fairly easily from a lot of available products. So the Conclusion is that the chemistry of  Breaking Bad highly accurate, let aside some exceptions, which can be made for the artistic freedom.Sources and other Credits: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention How much of the science in Breaking Bad is real?HomeList of deaths on Breaking Badand My Chemistry Professors :D",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"I had shared this anecdote before on Quora on another question, but I feel it would also qualify as an answer for this.I was taking JEE (Joint entrance exam for Engineering colleges in India) in 2012, in a school in Jaipur.In such a large scale exam like the JEE, there are high chances of errors,  misprints and confusions. So every student was contacting the invigilators almost every minute asking questions. The invigilators were staffs of the school with minimal knowledge of the subject/content asked in the exam. Students were asking the invigilator to call the  IIT-JEE representative who was appointed for that center, but probably he was busy handling similar issues in other rooms. And there was I with my head down, giving least amount of attention to the class  and trying to solve the questions as if my life depends on it. There was a question which (later faced reasonable controversy) had the following image with it. ​One of the two semi-circles was supposed to be shaded, but it was pretty unclear in the poorly printed image. Since it was a printing error I thought the invigilators will be able to help  (may be only my paper had that error). So I raised my hand and one of  the invigilators came to me, rather reluctantly almost prepared with his answer. Me: Sir, I need some help, the shaded part is not clear.He: (involuntarily) I don't know anything about this, I teach French.Me: OK then, ""la shaded partie n'est pas clair"".He chuckled and moved swiftly to call the representative from IIT-JEE. Later the Invigilator also gave me half a smile while collecting my paper in the end.P.S: I didn't know the French word for ""shaded"" so decided to use the English word instead.",high,high,high,high,low

Given  the role that alcohol plays in many things that would have been  a “no”  without a night of drinking — driving under the influence,  sexual  assault, vandalism, public urination, random “woot-woot”-ing as  you  ping-pong down the sidewalk — it’s probably not the best idea for a   multinational multibillion-dollar business like Bud Light’s parent   company AB InBev to publicly acknowledge that its product can lead  users  down a path to stupid consequences. Reports suggest that this  tag-line passed 5 levels of hierarchy before making it to the market.

Pratik-Jha-3,"Posted originally by the Author on deraileddouchebaggery.comPep Privileged | Derailed DouchebaggeryI think there is a difference between Pep's strategy at Barcelona to that at Bayern. He used the strengths of the players beautifully, that was ability on the ball for Barcelona and Pace and power for Bayern.Here is a detailed analysis of Pep's strategies at both Barca and BayernPep’s Barcelona and the 4-3-3Even before we get into talk of the actual formations, I think it is  essential that we fully recognize Pep’s philosophy – to build teams on  the foundations of unison, work rate, patience, ball movement, zonal  play, positional play and finally dynamism, both in his formations as  well as its personnel. Each of his acquisitions were done with a  specific goal in mind.In his all-conquering first season when Barcelona won the treble,  Guardiola operated predominantly with a 4-3-3 formation. While many  critics believe that all he did was put together a group of some of the  most talented players around, that is not necessarily true. Guardiola  had a plan and a reason for putting in each of the players that he  inserted regularly into his line-ups.Holding possession by moving the ball both laterally and forward with  crisp, short passes was the principle that they religiously stuck to.  And they would wait for their opportunities when the opposing defence  would get unhinged to strike the final blow. This early version though  played slightly quicker, largely due to the presence of forwards Thierry  Henry, who played wide left, Samuel Eto’o who played through the middle  and Lionel Messi, who started wide right.Behind that trio was Sergio Busquets, promoted from the B team, in  the holding role, with Xavi and Andres Iniesta to his right and left  respectively. Eto’o at the time was at the height of his powers while  Messi had still not reached his magical peak yet. So utilizing the pace  and power of Henry and Eto’o, while relying on Messi’s ability to  dribble and draw defenders was essential.Xavi played behind the front three as the Deep Lying Playmaker and  Busquets played the role of Anchor-man & Xavi’s wingman, always  moving with him, protecting him from opposing defenders and acting as a  foil to receive and spray passes. He was also the added cover for the  backline, slotting in for one of the centre-backs, notably Gerard Pique,  whenever he ventured forward.Iniesta would venture further forward as the Advanced Playmaker, either  going central to support the forward trio or taking up the space out  wide vacated by Henry or Messi. This also required a very hardworking  central striker and Eto’o did just that, sometimes falling back to  receive the ball and actually allow Henry and Messi to work as a front  twoSubsequently, Guardiola converted Messi into a full-fledged striker  from a winger, and Eto’o and Henry would depart. Zlatan Ibrahimovic was  bought as Guardiola wanted to find a different way of scoring goals, but  that experiment didn’t go very well and he used him sparingly. This was  when the triangle offense really came into its own as Barca’s players  would move forward with the ball, triangulating their passing with  almost geometric precision to unseat teams. Can you believe that 2008-09  was the last time that Messi scored less than 49 goals in all  competitions?David Villa would take up Henry’s role out wide on the left after the  Frenchman’s departure and Pedro would take up the wide right position.  However, Pedro wasn’t a regular in the team and Guardiola would go quite  a fewgameswith Iniesta/Villa/Messi as the front three.Then came the acquisition of Cesc Fabregas and the introduction of the false nine concept. With Fabregas and also Alexis Sanchez in the side, Guardiola had a new level of freedom and dexterity with which to  operate. Both Fabregas and Sanchez could play in a multitude of  positions, which is why they were bought. Fabregas enabled Pep to play  the striker-less formations, the conventional 4-4-2 with Messi and  Pedro/Sanchez up front, a 4-1-3-2 with him playing in a midfield three  with Iniesta and Xavi and Pedro and Sanchez either side of Messi up  front.Defensively, Alves would bomb forward on the right with Puyol  covering for him. That would result in Abidal falling back into the left  side of a back three with Pique and Puyol. Also, the long balls were  sparingly employed by Pep’s Barca sides as they lacked the height and  physicality up front and also because their defenders were more  comfortable playing the ball out on the ground as Pique continuously  did. Pique’s forays forward also meant a covering job for Busquets to  drop back and aid Puyol and Abidal.Throughout his time at Barca, there were two players outside of Messi  that were of utmost importance to make the formation work and make it  dynamic – Alves and Abidal.Alves was key in the attacking areas of the right flank. His  intricate interchanges with Messi in the opposition half were one of  Barcelona’s biggest threats. When Messi moved into the middle as a false  nine, Alves continued to play high up the pitch, importantly stretching  the play, especially since both Villa and Pedro too were more inclined  to move in from out wide. His ability to go up and down so regularly and  with such frightening results made up for the lack of a right winger or  right midfielder. His forward menace also managed to keep the  opposition left-back pinned down in his own half.Abidal was hugely important in compensating for Alves. He would push  forward when necessary, but his ability to sense danger and drop deep to  operate as an additional third centre-back when required were  irreplaceable. He also covered for Busquets and Pique in their  respective roles whenever Barca were in pursuit of a goal and pushed  more bodies forward. Abidal was the guy who made the formation tick at  the back with his amazing ability to play left-back, centre-back and  defensive midfield to perfection.All in all, Guardiola’s formula at Barca for much of his stay was  built on the full-backs, dribbling centre-backs, the wide forwards who  would dart in and the midfield duo of Iniesta and Xavi and later the  concept of the ‘false forward’.Bayern 1.0 - Beginnings with 4-1-4-1German giants Bayern Munich came calling for Guardiola’s services and  he agreed to take over the reins from the 2013-14 season onwards in  what was a tough act to follow as his predecessor Jupp Heynckes signed  off in some style leading the Bavarians to a historic treble with a team  that was devastatingly destructive.Bayern 1.0 saw Guardiola employ a 4-1-4-1 formation. This formation  was built to explore Bayern’s depth in midfield especially around the ability of Toni Kroos to distribute,  move up and down the middle of the pitch and also play as a playmaker.  While at Barca, Guardiola had players of short stature at his disposal  who were very good in possession; at Bayern he had more direct players  in the likes of Thomas Müller, Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery and he  tried to cater to their strengths by banking on the influential Kroos.Philip Lahm, possibly the best right-back in the world was given a  new role by Guardiola as a holding midfielder breaking up the erstwhile  duo of Bastian Schweinsteiger and Javi Martinez that his predecessor  used to telling effect. His need for a more mobile holding player with  good passing range saw him make the shift and that meant Rafinha would  take Lahm’s place at right-back.However, the full-backs under this system were part of a mobile  triumvirate that would move up and down with Lahm and would more often  than not join up with the two central midfielders to make a four in the  middle occupying the space vacated by the two wingers who’ve joined up  in attack. The use of ‘false full-backs’ was made possible by the  presence of Ribery and Robben, who provided the width with their forays  out wide to reduce the necessity for advanced full-backs. In the absence  of one or both, Alaba and Rafinha tended to play in a more traditional  full-back role.And it was that versatility that got them off to such a flying start last season, eventually helping them win the Bundesliga at a canter. Opposing teams simply could not handle the many different  attacking formations in the form of an attacking double-pivot of either  Götze/Robben, Götze/Müller or Müller/Robben. Also, unlike at Barca, this  Guardiola team played a good number of good long balls because – a.  their defenders weren’t the dribbly kind like Pique and b. the presence  of aerially gifted players such as Müller and Mario Mandzukic.The presence of multiple playmakers ensured that they could swap  roles freely and the ones not on the ball could then run the channels  effectively, complementarily opening up space for each other to operate  in.The overlying emphasis of this formation was to always have three  central midfielders on the pitch at any point of time. That’s why Pep  went out and bought Thiago Alcantara, not for old time’s sake. Lahm  explained as much in an interview last year:“Also, outwardly it appears as if we’ve changed our system, but if  you look more closely we still have three central midfielders on the  pitch. Whether there’s one No.6 [a primarily defensive holding  midfielder] and two No.10s [offensive midfielders], or one No.6 and two  No.8s [more creative holding midfielders] or maybe one No.8, one No.6  and one No.10 – there are three players in central midfield. To give you  an example, last season Toni Kroos [a typical No.10] sometimes played  in the No.6 position alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger. It’s open to  debate whether or not you could have spoken of two No. 6 players in  those moments. So each of the three players fills the position with his  own identity and his characteristics. That is what counts.”The attacking pivots also helped in pressing from the front and while  not as intense and harrying as they were under Heynckes, Bayern were  still very effective doing their version of the Barca press to  dispossess opponents.This formation was another continuation in the triangle system of  Guardiola, except that instead of widening the pitch to stretch the  defence like at Barca, here the system was about overloading the centre  of the park with triangles formed all around the centremost midfielder,  usually either Kroos, Lahm or Schweinsteiger.  And this system also kept up the bargain of tactical flexibility for  Guardiola as it could morph into a 3-4-1-2, 4-4-2, 4-3-3, even a 2-4-4  at times if chasing a game.  The 4-1-4-1 for all its tactical nuances had some weaknesses. It  involved the full-backs playing almost as midfielders and with Lahm’s  solidity no longer present at right-back, it exposed Bayern, who played a  high defensive line, to individual mistakes and long passes. And as  brilliant a sweeper-keeper as Manuel Neuer is, he could not always save  the day for them, especially against quality opposition.When used ineffectively the overload of playmakers in the centre  muddled the midfield and made their attack look toothless and the  build-up slow. Also, they could almost never capitalize on quick  counter-attacking opportunities.All of this came to a head in their semi-final tie against Real  Madrid in last year’s UEFA Champions League. Madrid were a side  perfectly built to expose each and every flaw of this system and it was a  matchup nightmare for the German side. A front six of Cristiano  Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Gareth Bale, Angel di Maria, Luka Modric and  Xabi Alonso had too much pace, power, and on-ball ability to be  contained by the 4-1-4-1. Ronaldo and Bale ran roughshod over the two  ‘false full-backs’ and Benzema’s movement in combination with one of the  two plus di Maria took the two centre-backs out of the equation as  well.Also a few players such as Mandzukic suffered as he was forced to  make runs out wide and become a provider at times instead of a goal  threat and that saw him lose his starting spot to a midfielder with  Guardiola preferring to play Müller as the lone striker instead. Ribery  and Robben were forced to make the unnatural shift to receiving the ball  and quickly giving it back, instead of venturing forward to take on the  defenders which took the destructive nature out of Bayern’s attacks.Bayern 2.0 – A 3-4-3 With all that had gone by and seeing the limitations that the 4-1-4-1  caused, Guardiola introduced a 3-4-3 system against Borussia Dortmund  in the DFB Pokal final of last year to redeem himself after the  chastening defeat to Madrid. And he has continued with it this season.The 3-man backline sacrifices width for numerical superiority in  dealing with opposing attackers while providing a man advantage in  midfield.In defence, it relies on the 3-man backline and the 4-man midfield,  which includes the two wingbacks. And in attack, the formation moulds  into a 3-4-1-2 or 3-4-2-1 using either one attacking midfielder  (Götze/Kroos) behind two strikers (Mandzukic/Robben and Müller) or two  attacking midfielders (Kroos/Müller, Kroos/Götze) and the lone striker  (Robben/Müller/Mandzukic).The 3-4-2-1 has been the one that Bayern have gone with more often  and it is a very demanding formation. The two withdrawn strikers or  attacking mids play a critical role as they alternate between shifting  wide or tucking in behind the main striker. Due to only one striker up  top and a lack of wingers, the role of the wingbacks becomes more  important. Without their inputs, Bayern can't maintain their superiority  when attacking. While being aggressive though, they have to remain  disciplined, as they are the sole defensive cover on the wings. So even  one slip-up can be costly.However, the 3-man backline does provide an extra target against  teams whose forwards press hard, like Dortmund. The extra man enables  them to pass the ball out smoother. The central centre-back often  functions as a key distributor, much like Pique did at Barca while the  two guys either side of him push wide almost in a full-back-like  position to use and cover the space.Someone like Javi Martinez and Holger Badstuber, both of whom have  played as defensive midfielders, can play centre-back better in this  formation as it helps them break up play, even at the cost of leaving  their position thanks to added protection from the sides and also helps  in their distribution. If need be they can even step in to join the  midfield to provide extra impetus in attack as the other two  centre-backs would then converge to form a back-two.Till now, Guardiola has used six different players in the full-back  roles this season – Pierre Hoijberg, Juan Bernat, Philip Lahm, David  Alaba, Rafinha and Sebastian Rode. Each of them offers him something  different;  Bernat is more of a traditional full-back and more or less  parks himself along the touchline; Alaba and Rafinha are capable of not  just playing as full-backs, but also tucking into midfield while Rode  and Hoijberg are more inclined to drop inwards as defensive midfielders.Depending on what weakness a certain opponent has and what he wants  to guard against regards his own team, Guardiola can pick his personnel.  To top that, you have Lahm, who can play any of those positions on  either side. And hence the dynamic fluidity of the wingbacks will be  something to look forward to this season.Each has its own by-product too. Rafinha and Bernat playing generally  means they will stay wide to stretch defences providing space for the  holding midfielder(s) and centre-backs to join in the attacks; when  Alaba and Lahm play, they can go either way, bombing forward in attack  or cutting in allowing the likes of Götze, Robben, Ribery and Shaqiri to  go wide.The acquisition of Xabi Alonso has also greatly aided this formation as he acts as a defensive cover,  partnering Lahm and due to his long-ball ability can support the attack  without ceding his position from deep. Perhaps that’s why they went for  him over Sami Khedira. He also drops in as auxiliary centre-back for Jerome Boateng whenever necessary. Mehdi Benatia’s arrival has also bolstered the defensive ranks.The system also helps for the cover of Kroos with Alonso now playing  Lahm’s role from last year allowing the captain to operate further up  the pitch in the right side of a diamond with Alonso bottom, Alaba left  and Götze at the tip. It will get even better when Thiago returns from  injury for he brings with him an added dimension where he can play  double-pivot with Lahm (as Kroos did last year).  There’s also Robert Lewandowski at his disposal this year. He finally has the dynamic possession-based striker  he's always wanted. The mobility the Pole brings into that frontline  allows Pep to use different combinations of attacking midfielders behind  him. Lewandowski can play as a false 9, play wide by interchanging with  the wide players and can even drop deep when needed. Götze and Müller  augmenting the Pole makes for a very creative frontline. It also allows  him to switch from two midfielders and a striker to one midfielder and  two strikers (Müller joining Lewandowski) fluidly during a game.This formation like the 4-1-4-1 last year can also seamlessly morph  into a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-3-3, a 3-5-2, or even a 3-2-2-3 (as against  Manchester United in the Champions League last year) as the situation  demandsAnother tweak and the 3-3-3-1We have also seen Bayern operate in a 3-3-3-1 in a couple of games  where three clear lines of three (defenders, holding mids, attacking  mids) stack up on top of each other with a lone forward up front. At  home to Stuttgart in the third game of their Bundesliga campaign, Bayern  started with Badstuber-Dante-Boateng in a 3-man backline. On top of  them stood Bernat, Alonso and Lahm. They opted for this rigid defensive  setup as a base on which to work from.The forward line played according to the movements of Müller. When  the German went wide right, Lahm would step into his attacking role  while Boateng would support him on the flanks. If he moved up to support  Lewandowski, Lahm would go right to provide width and again would be  supported by Boateng. Accordingly, Götze would do the same, either  slipping in behind the two strikers to form a diamond or go wide left.Evolution based on adjustments and experimentsAs we’ve covered the various formations there are a few things that  become very evident as core characteristics of any formation that  Guardiola deploys:- Possession- Constant and fluid adjustments during a game- Attacking and defending as a unit- Coordinated positional play- A fetish for multi-skilled and multi-positional playersFor the vast majority of the time, his formations and their  underlying ethos have served his teams brilliantly. On the rare  occasion, they have been trumped by strong teams with tactically astute  managers and players built to tackle a Guardiola team.At Barcelona, they were at times too one-dimensional and teams would  ‘park the bus’ to snuff them out and hit them on the counter to emerge  victorious. The form of Pique and Puyol also tapered towards the end of  his reign which made Barca more susceptible to opposition attacks, the  defence being an area he did not address.Upon his arrival at Bayern, many predicted he would imbibe the tiki-taka system  there too, but he didn’t (not entirely) choosing to work around the  strengths of the players present in the team. But his 4-1-4-1 formation,  despite offering much flexibility, had a soft underbelly and was  exposed as last season wore on and this year, in recognition of that, he  has made another alteration.The jury is still out on the two new systems, but one thing is for  sure, the pace has quickened up considerably; the build-up is not as  slow as what it was last year and the new formation allows for greater  gamut of changes through one single game as seen against Manchester City  in their Champions League opener where Alaba went from playing left  centre-back in a back-three, to left wingback to the left of a midfield  diamond in the space of about 45 minutes.Also, Götze has gotten a greater role (Iniesta’s role) and is the  leading scorer overall for the club with 5 goals which tells a story in  itself. The presence of Lewandowski has accentuated the talents of his  midfielders.As always, Guardiola is thinking, scheming and looking to constantly  adjust his team so that they don’t become predictable. He learns from  his previous experiments, reinforces what worked while reanalysing the  elements that didn’t (like Schweinsteiger not working well in his fluid  formations and encouraging Lahm to play a box-to-box role this year) and  tweaking them.From now to the end of the season, we may yet see more new tactics  and formations from the Spaniard’s box. After all, the man has  re-defined formations and brought about a true evolution in that domain  like never seen before.Phew!",high,high,high,high,low

Pratik-Jha-3,"Talking of mistakes and failures by multi-billion dollar company, I would like to tell you how and why one of the biggest companies in the world Walmart failed in Germany.In 1997 and 1998 Walmart acquired two companies - Wertkauf and Interspar -  in Germany and soon miserably failed due to cultural misunderstanding and employee mismanagement.  Walmart never officially published the losses it experienced during its  stay in Germany. However, some analysts estimate that the losses of  Walmart were US$ 200-US$ 300 million per annum.Though there has been a lot of discussion on this failure and everybody has their own theories, but it could be summed up in 2 Clusters further subdivided into the following points.1. The first cluster is related to employee mismanagement.Firstly, some of the American employee management practices just didn’t  fit in the German context. For example, each employee before the shift  had to participate in a morning exercise. In could be seen as harmless,  but the best thing about this practice was that they had to do it  chanting “WALMART! WALMART! WALMART!” . If in America such practice  could be used to boost morale and inspire loyalty, then in Germany it  was looked upon with annoyance, to put it mildly.Walmart's anti-union stance has been core to its US success in holding down costs and thus its ability to offer discount pricing, but Germans generally see a closer link between labor unions and democracy. WalMart's failure to appreciate and adjust to this attitude was the start of its adverse image in Germany.Walmart had a code for its employees which prohibited them from relationships at work place and provided a helpline for the employees to report on any rules violation by other employees. This ammount of personal interference was not accepted by the German employees. 2. The second set of factors is related to the lack of analyses of the local market and the specifics of local customers’ demands.As strange as it sounds, habits of the average German customer weren’t  taken into account. Germans are known to be efficient and spend as  little time in the shops as possible. However, Walmart’s stalls were  placed in such a way that the customer will have to spend more time  shop. (This is one of my favorite reasons) at the check-out desks, the cashiers were ordered to always be smiling.  In Germany it is considered not normal to smile at total strangers. So  the German cashiers, who were not in the habit of smiling at strangers,  attempted to follow the orders but felt uncomfortable. As a result, the  smiles didn’t seem sincere, which again, aroused not the best feelings  towards Walmart in its customers. Walmart used a lot of plastic in packaging and as plastic bags. During that time the ideas of conservation of environment and recycling were gaining  momentum in Germany. That is why Walmart’s plastic bags and redundancy of plastic  packaging aroused more annoyance rather than enjoyment .So to cut the story short, Walmart failed quite miserably in Germany due to the inability to adapt to cultural and professional differences.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"“You would not believe half of what is happening in King’s  Landing, sweetling. Cersei stumbles from one idiocy to the next, helped  along by her council of the deaf, the dim, and the blind. I always  anticipated that she would beggar the realm and destroy herself, but I  never expected she would do it quite so fast. It is quite  vexing. I had hoped to have four or five quiet years to plant some seeds  and allow some fruits to ripen, but now… it is a good thing that I  thrive on chaos. What little peace and order the five kings left us will  not long survive the three queens, I fear.” “Three queens?” She did not understand. Nor did Petyr choose to explain.Now, for most of us it is pretty clear that two of those queens are Cersei and Margaery as they have been playing their cards from quite some time.For the 3rd position we have a competition. It could be Ollena Martell (the Queen of thorns), but she is on the side of Margaery, so we can rule her out. there are other options possibly on his radar, like Asha Greyjoy  (would-be queen of the Iron Islands), Selyse Florent (Stannis’s queen),  or Melisandre (Stannis’s “true queen”).That Leaves us with two major candidates, Sansa and Danerys. But just after Petyr mentioned the 3 queens he starts talking about the betrothal to the future Lord of the Vale that he had arranged for her (in the books), it doesn’t seem like he’s thinking of her as a queen. Though queen of Westeros is quite possibly his final plan for Sansa — but since he says peace and order won’t survive the  three queens, that seems like a contradiction to his usual “everyone  will love you” approach with her.Dany has a strong claim too. News of her expansion and dragons have reached Westeros and she has the Targaryen connect too. But I have always felt that in the coming times, there will be a 2 tier war in a song of ice and fire, the eternal war where Dany will fight with her dragons against ""The Great other"" and the game of the mere mortals where the 3 queen will bite their nails.So who are these 3 queens, one could only speculate. For what we know, he might be lying (so that Sansa feels like a queen), he surely has the reputation for that.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"The Right Wing, who would have thought that this will be Gunner's worry for this season. There was fair amount of depth on the right, Ramsey, Walcott, Ox, Welbeck, Rosicky, and in this weird turn of events all of them is injured now. Ox and Walcott are going to miss games against Swansea, Bayern Munich and Spurs.So do we have left on the Right wing.Joel CampbellPros: Is alive and fit. Quite fresh too given that he’s hardly played so far this season. Tries hard.Cons: Doesn’t appear to be very good at football.  It’s certainly possible that he could improve if he’s given more game  time, and of all the choices it seems the most natural. An attacking  player for an attacking player, playing in an attacking position.Alexis SanchezPros: Is Alexis.Cons: Means we then need to fill gap on the left,  perhaps moving Kieran Gibbs to the left hand side of the attacking trio  where he has played in the past – usually at the end of games when we  need to hang onto something. Alexis has played out there before, but I  seem to associate it with a run of pretty poor results in the first part  of last season. I could be wrong there though, and it’s too early to do  that amount of digging.Hector BellerinPros: Is very fast and likes to play in that part of  the pitch anyway. His delivery is good. He can beat full-backs. He  creates chances and gets assists. Has excellent hair.Cons: Means moving our best right back out of  position. Options to replace him there are unconvincing. Mathieu Debuchy  is struggling for form – although perhaps a run of games, something  he’s spoken about needing, will help him to return to a level slightly  above miserable form now. Calum Chambers also a possible, although having  been reamed last season by Jefferson Montero, is likely to find it tough  against him then Douglas Costa.Alex IwobiPros: Clearly has some talent. Wenger loves giving young players a go.Cons: According to the manager he’s not ready for  Capital One Cup football. That would seem to rule him out of Premier  League games against Swansea and Sp*rs, and a trip to Bayern Munich.  Given our spate of injuries though, some of those ‘not ready’ players  are going to have to be on stand-by, and we’re going to have work on  their readiness.Mesut OzilPros: Can deliver beautiful crosses for Giroud, as seen in the game against Everton. Has played there after a 4-3-3 shift in end parts of some games this season.Cons : He does not like playing there, he has been bloody good in the no. 10 role. Getting him on the left will mean playing 17 year old Kristyn Belik or Flamini in the mid-field. Cant really seem as a very safe option.I think palying Bellerin up with Debuchy covering can be a safe and secure option. Though removing probably one of the best players this season from out of his position will be risky.Only time (and Wenger) will tell.Credits and Source: Arseblog … an Arsenal blog.",high,high,high,high,low

Love Sex Aur DhokaWhy You Need to Watch This: The film was made for a  mere Rs. 1.5 crore and earned over Rs. 7 crore making it a big  commercial success. It touched upon a number of interesting themes,  including voyeurism and the moral disintegration of the television news  media. There were three different sub-plots that tackled honor killings,  MMS scandals and sting operations respectively.2. Stanley ka DabbaWhy You Need to Watch This: The story was very  simple yet extremely effective. It is the story of an orphan boy and his  experiences in school, with his friends, and especially with one tyrant  teacher. The teacher's role was essayed by Amol Gupte himself. this  film presented a very genuine picture of school life, but a lack of big  names in the film meant that it didn't get its due.3. My Brother NikhilWhy You Need to Watch This: It was one of the first  Hindi films to portray homosexuality on-screen. The movie is about  Nikhil's chronicles and the people around him. The director, Onir, says  it's based on a true story. This critically acclaimed movie failed  because of the 'No-Masala' element.4. Johnny GaddarWhy You Need to Watch This: Excellent performances  by the cast and a movie inspired by James Hadey Chase novels, it was a  moderate commercial success even though it was an 'edge-of-the-seat'  thriller.5. Do Dooni ChaarWhy You Need to Watch This: One of the most honest  portrayals of a middle class Indian family. The movie touches upon  issues like underpaid teachers, moral dilemma and dreams vs  practicality.6. Ek Hasina ThiWhy You Need to Watch This: It was women centric  film (the women triumphs at the end) and partly because Urmila was not a  star name and Saif hadn't yet become the big star he is today. There  were similarities between this film's plot and a Sidney Sheldon novel,  If Tomorrow Comes. The film's editing received special appreciation.7. Manorama Six Feet UnderWhy You Need to Watch This: Another thriller that stood out from the rest. Abhay Deol's performance in this film is considered to be one of his best!8. Dil Dosti etcWhy You Need to Watch This: To admit a fact, the  movie production wasn't very good which is why it looks a little tacky  at some points but that doesn't take away anything from this brilliant  film. It is one of the few films to present a true picture of Indian  youth.9. ParzaniaWhy You Need to Watch This: Parzania was the most  heartfelt film made based on the Gujarat riots that took place in 2002.  It is based on a true story. The movie revolves around the plight of the  parents of a missing boy who are desperately looking for him. The film  was even banned in Gujarat.10. SeharWhy You Need to Watch This: Arshad Warsi is one of  the most underrated actors in Bollywood and Sehar is the best film  possible to illustrate this fact.

GulaalWhy You Need to Watch This: Issues like unjust gain  of power, powerful people and their hypocrisy, the need for legitimate  recognition and injustices that we perceive have been forced on us are  very much relevant even today are being touched upon in this film. Each  character in the film was brilliantly written and developed and the  soundtrack was one of the highlights of the film.12. Being CyrusWhy You Need to Watch This: Being Cyrus is one of  the tautest psychological thriller/drama films made in India in the last  decade or so. It is about a dysfunctional Parsi family, the Sethnas,  and how the entry of Cyrus in their lives changes their fortunes  forever. The film was in English and that proved to be the main obstacle  in reaching out to a larger audience.13. Gandhi, My FatherWhy You Need to Watch This: The movie explored the  troubled relationship between Mahatma Gandhi and his son Harilal Gandhi.  Akshay Khanna's performance is his best till date.14. LakshyaWhy You Need to Watch This: This war drama never  really got its due recognition and neither did Hrithik's brilliant  performance. It is till date Hrithik's best performance of his  illustrious career, but the film might be the least talked about of his  career.15. UdaanWhy You Need to Watch This: The movie didn't do well  at the box office and yet became a cult film.

Oye Lucky Lucky OyeWhy You Need to Watch This: The film is inspired by  the real life shenanigans of Devinder Singh alias Bunty, a real-life  “super-chor”, originally from Vikaspuri, Delhi. It received positive  critical acclaim and was a below average box office movie.22. 99Why You Need to Watch This: 99 is an original story  inspired by real events. It is the story of two men in two cities who  are bound by a common feeling of always being stuck at 99. They never  seem to make it to a 'century' in life. The plot involves small-time  crooks, conspiracies, car crashes, a briefcase full of money and a  historical controversy brewing in the background.23. Pyar ka PunchnamaWhy You Need to Watch This: The movie revolves  around the love life of 3 young bachelors and received mixed reviews  from critics.

Pratik-Jha-3,"I hope this question is coming from where I think it is coming.Actually there are two countries that are claiming to be called China and officially none of them is China.Lets first talk about the this huge ""place"" with the 3rd largest land-mass and largest population which we generally call China.This is officially called the ""People's Republic of China"". And the other China is a small Island on the South-East of China popularly known as Taiwan.Now this island is officially called 'The Republic of China' (who also represented ""China"" in the United States until 1971)  and both of them are trying to claim the same land, The Chinese mainland.So Is Taiwan a country?That answer would depend on how you define a country. It is pretty much like any other countries, They have their own passport, own Flag, own President, on military, they even take participation in international sporting events like Olympics and FIFA world cup, under the name of Chinese Taipei (to not piss off China (the larger one)).But they are not officially recognised by countries like USA. Why?, you ask. Well... lest just say diplomatic relation. Read,"" No one wants to piss off China"".So officially there is no country called China, but if you use the word to refer to the 1.3 billion people living in the land space between Russia and India, you wouldn't be much wrong.Sources and Further Reads: China, Taiwan, Oct. 25, 1971 | People's Republic of China In, Taiwan Out, at U.N..",high,high,high,high,low

This will help you shape your sentences better. It is a true that every individual has a different mindset, but if you can connect to major portion of the audience, it always works wonders.Always establish your credibility for the topic you are speaking about: Begin your speech with telling people why you are here to talk in front of them. For example if I am giving a speech on becoming a better public speaker, I may start with, ""For the past couple of years I have been overseeing the development of budding public speakers, that has given me the opportunity to learn and to teach..."" If you have established your credibility, it will show in your confidence and also in people's attention.Involve your audience: Make the audience part of your act.

Pratik-Jha-3,"Let's try and see what all the contenders are doing this season.Chelsea: Even in the worst of their dreams Chelsea fans would not have expected this. It has been a miserbale start to the season for the defending champions, and wining two League tittles in a row is already a big big ask. Mourinho tried to steady the ship with the buy of Pedro, but I cannot he him and Hazard both playing in a mourinho team. On an average the Champions team in the league has lost 3-4 games in the season, Chelsea has already lost 5. It will be a miracle to see them reach even the top 3.Manchester City: Last years runner ups, they have done some real quality spending with Ottamendi, Sterling and DeBuyne. They look on track to being very close to the top. With the likes of Silva and Aguero coming back from injury things can only get better for them. The only big problem they have to face this season is that, they will want to compete for all the four trophies this season, for that they need to keep their players fit (esp. Kompany, Silva, Aguero, Debruyne). (extra read: Pratik Jha's answer to Is Kevin De Bruyne the right fit for Manchester City?) Arsenal: As Alan Shearer rightly said in one of the episodes of MoTD, this is Arsenal's biggest chance to win the League.  Chelsea and Manchester United will buy big next summer. City will try and fill their gaps as they always do. Liverpool could be a force with Klopp and the players he wants to buy. There may not be ""the next season"" for Arsenal. They have to, have to win this time around. The season so far has been pretty good in the League. The opening day loss to West Ham was of course a big set-back but the recovery is very evident. They need to get results in big games and most importantl stay fit. (Arsenal cannot afford to go the Europa league from the 3rd place in the Champions League group.)Machester United: The red devils this season have been rather inconsistent. They were leaders for a week and then they got thrashed by a spirited Arsenal. After that they go to Goodison Park and gather a great win. They need to be more consistent to win the league. Their attack has been rather unidirectional under LVG and they need to be more creative. It will be difficult to see them reaching the top of the table at the end, but they will surely be up their competing for it.Spur: Undoubltedly the youngest and the fittest side is the Premier League. They have shown what they can do with a convincing win over City. What they need now is a leader of men, someone who can push the team, push the players, inspire them to make a difference. Loris or Vertonghen will have to step up here. They have a big chance to reach the top 4 and play the Champions League next season. But you never know, they are Spurs.tl;dr: It looks like a two horse race now between City and Arseanl with the former having the edge. Though City has an ageing squad which could wear down later in the season. Arsenal will have to keep player fit and they have a big, big chance this time.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"A little-known episode from the MahabharataWhen Arjuna Wanted to Kill Yudhishthira                        It was  the seventeenth day of battle on the field of Kurukshetra. The most  bloody war that had taken a huge toll on human lives and emotions seemed  immaterial and irrelevant to many. Even though most of the Maharathis  of the Kaurava army had fallen, including Bhishma on the tenth day and  Drona on the fifteenth, Karna still remained. He was now the commander  of the Kaurava army, and had been unstoppable.                        Karna was  at his best, scattering the “Pandu soldiers, like a mass of cotton by  the speed of a mighty wind.” So much so that a harried Yudhishthira had  withdrawn from the battlefield, unable to withstand the force of Karna’s  assault, retiring to his camp where he awaited news of Karna’s death.  That piece of news, he was confident, would come from Arjuna himself.  After all, hadn’t Arjuna vowed to kill Karna. With Krishna as his  charioteer, how could he but not succeed?When Arjuna came to meet Yudhishthira			 			    			    When  Yudhishthira saw both Krishna and Arjuna enter his tent, he thought  that the charioteer’s son (Karna) had been killed. Yudhishthira  exclaimed, “By killing Karna, you have brought an end to my enemies.”  The humiliations suffered at the game of dice at the hands of Karna when  he had called the Pandavas “sterile seeds of sesamum”, the anger at  knowing that it was Karna’s protection and friendship that fueled  Duryodhana’s enmity and the helplessness felt when he called Draupadi a  prostitute —all had been avenged.When Arjuna came to meet Yudhishthira                                            In this  moment of triumph, Yudhishthira revealed the inner torment that had been  troubling him all these years. “I have been frightened about him for  thirteen years. I was not able to sleep at night. Nor could I be happy  during the day… Whether I was awake of sleeping, Karna was always in  front of me.” More than Bhishma or Drona, it had been Karna who had been  the biggest thorn in the Pandava’s side. Yudhishthira now wanted to  know the details of Arjuna’s battle with Karna.                    But Arjuna had no answers…!                                            Arjuna,  on the other hand, had grown increasingly anxious over the absence of  his elder brother from the battlefield. Not seeing Yudhishthira made  Arjuna anxious. He had asked Bhima on Yudhishthira’s whereabouts, and  then proceeded to the eldest Pandava’s camp. When congratulated and  questioned by Yudhishthira, Arjuna responded that he had come to invite  Yudhishthira to witness Karna’s death at Arjuna’s hands.                        Arjuna  said, “Dear brother, I have not killed Karna yet. If you wish to see the  battle, there will be a fierce encounter today between me and the son  of a suta.” In short, Arjuna had just poured a bucket of cold water over  Yudhishthira’s premature joy. Yudhishithira’s disappointment was  crushing. His anger and frustration boiled over, and he railed against  Arjuna.Yudhishithira’s frustration                                            Yudhishthira  lost his cool and started calling Arjuna “worthless”, accusing him of  being “affectionate towards Suyodhana”, of being fearful of Karna, and  ending with what today reads like a typical dialogue from a Hindi movie:  “It would have been better if you had not been born in Pritha’s womb.”  In the heat of the moment, Yudhishthira asks Arjuna to “give up the  Gandiva” and says that he will ask Bhima or Lord Krishna to kill Karna.                                                                            …And Arjuna attacked his eldest brother                                            Gandiva’s  insult made Arjuna extremely furious. He draws his sword and rushes  towards his brother. Krishna stops him and asks him the reason for  drawing the sword. Arjuna replies that he has a secret vow that anyone  who asks him to give up his bow shall be slain by him. In those days,  Kshatriyas had the habit of making a secret vow at the time of  completion of their training and they were expected to keep the vow at  any cost.                                                              A Kshatriya’s vow was at stake!                                            Yudhishtira,  in fact, had a vow of his own that he would never refuse an invitation  for a game of dice. No wonder he ended up losing his entire world,  twice. Similarly, Bhima had a vow that he would kill the person who  calls him moustache-less (which was a symbol of manhood then). Arjuna  tells Krishna that he had to stick to his vow at any cost and hence he  would have to kill Yudhishtira.Krishna’s intervention                                            Krishna  tells Arjuna that he is making a mistake with such senseless insistence  and reminds him of his bigger Dharma – that of winning the war. He tells  Arjuna that the right, and only, way to “kill” an elder was to use  harsh words and berate the elder. He instructs Arjuna to do the same  against Yudhishtira. Arjuna complies and showers his choicest abuses on  Yudhishtira. In his outburst, he keeps telling his brother how only  Bhima has the right to snub him (Arjuna) and not Yudhishtira.Arjuna’s suicide attempt                                            Arjuna  even called Yudhishtira incapable and accused him as the source of all  their problems. Upon completing his outburst, he draws his sword out  once again. A seemingly surprised Krishna asks him the reason for this  repeat act. Arjuna tells him that he can no longer live after having  abused his beloved brother in this manner.Krishna’s intervention                                            Krishna  once again counsels him and reminds him that suicide is not appropriate  for any human being as the body is the “Kshetra” where the “Sadhana” of  the soul can take place. Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha can be achieved  only by utilizing the body and therefore self-destruction of one’s body  is strictly prohibited. Krishna then provides a way out for Arjuna to  atone for the sin. He tells him that self-praise is equivalent to  suicide and so he should praise himself heartily.                                                            Arjuna killed Yudhishthira and committed suicide (metaphorically)                                            Arjuna  follows Krishna’s advice (once again!) and indulges in heavy self-praise  for a while. He goes on about how powerful he is and how many kings and  kingdoms were defeated by him. Thus, Arjuna “kills” himself. At the  end, Yudhishthira who is very down because of Arjuna’s abuses proceeds  to kill himself. Krishna stops him and explains the whole situation.  Arjuna falls at his brother’s feet and begs for pardon. Yudhishthira  excuses him and both of them embrace each other.Lessons hidden in this Mahabharata episodeLet us pause and ponder. Why would Arjuna, the ideal Pandava in so many  respects, who had a little over two weeks ago received the timeless  wisdom of the Gita from Krishna, lose control so much? How did matters  escalate to the point that these two brothers, the epitome of love,  would hurl abuses at each other?  To answer this question, ask this:  Aren’t we more likely to lose our temper when tired and exhausted, say  after a long week and day at work?  The answer may lie in something called “ego depletion”.  Self-control,  or willpower, can be compared with a muscle - every decision we take  that requires us to make a conscious choice tires that muscle. Unlike  normal physical muscles however, more use does not seem to make the  muscle of willpower stronger. The daily stress of more than two weeks on  the battlefield of Kurukshetra took a toll on the warriors.                         The anger  and frustration that would have been kept under control on day one was  no longer under check by day seventeen. The slightest provocation would  have sufficed. Ego depletion had set in. Even though Dharmaraj knew  better than to snap at his brother Arjuna, and so virulently, the  psychological toll of war had withered away self-control.                        Relating  this incident and Krishna’s message to our own lives, it is startling  that murder and suicide are the two things we repeatedly commit in our  lives, almost on a daily basis. Berating elders and self-praise is among  the most prevalent habits in society today. We do not even realize the  extent of the evil in both these behaviors.",high,high,high,high,low

Pratik-Jha-3,"Investment Companies make money in largely 2 ways.Underwrting income: This is basically the difference in the amount of money collected from the insured (us) in form of premiums and the money given to the one calming it in the hour of need. Refer to the answer by Mr Balaji Viswanathan for more insights.Investment Income: But what do they do of all the premium money they have from the insureds, they invest it. From this huge profits can be reaped, or lost. This is why companies like the Berkshire Hathaway  Insurance Company are formed (by Warren Hastings) ,so that they could generate capital to invest in the stock  market.In fact, insurance companies can sometimes, knowingly charge too little for  insurance policies and plan for an underwriting loss if they believe  they can make a profit from investing the money they receive before  having to pay claims. In the early 2000s, when the stock market was  booming, this practice was taking place.On the flip side, insurance rates may be raised to make up for stock market losses.So basically the money comes from managing risk, the risks of accidents and people claiming the insurance and the risk associated with the investment of this money.",high,high,high,high,low

A small club, not even(technically) from the same country trying to make it big.They have a pretty good stadium in the Liberty Stadium with around 20k capacity which is largely almost full.They were promoted to the premier league in the 2011-2012 season under Brendan Rodgers. Later Brenden Rodgers left and there comes one of my all time favorite players to replace him, Michael Laudrup(trust me he was bloody good). They were table toppers also for a week during his time. Sadly in 2014 Laudrup was sacked, but rather than bringing some hot shot successful manager, they decided to give the job to a 34 year old ex-Swansea defender Garry Monk. He knew what the club meant, he knew many players and he showed how to play attractive football. They presently play one of the most attractive style of football. I am an absolute fan of their midfield.  They have a brilliant trequarista  in Gylfi Sigurðsson, who can make goals an even score them. They have two really good box to box goal scoring mid fielders in Shelvey and Ki Sung Yueng. They have also bought a defensive minded midfielder in Jack Cork to give them the defensive stability.They have also got really pacey wide players in Jeferson Montero, Nathan Dyer, Wayne Routledge. They lost a really good striker in Wilfred Bony to ""his childhood dream"" Manchester City, they play attractive football and try and score many goals.

Pratik-Jha-3,"The division of India into different states was a very stepwise process.So let me take you back to when it all started. August 1947 Most of the states acceded to India, and a few to Pakistan. Bhutan and Hyderabad opted for independence, although the armed intervention of India conquered Hyderabad and brought it into the Indian Union. Between 1947 and about 1950, the territories of the princely states were  politically integrated into the Indian Union. Most were merged into  existing provinces; others were organised into new provinces, such as Rajputana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Vindhya Pradesh, made up of multiple princely states; a few, including Mysore, Hyderabad, Bhopal, and Bilaspur, became separate provinces.The new Constitution of India which came into force on 26 January 1950, made India a sovereign  democratic republic. The new republic was also declared to be a ""Union  of States"". The constitution of 1950 distinguished between three main types of states:Part A states, which were the former governors' provinces of British  India, were ruled by an elected governor and state legislature. The nine  Part A states were Assam, Bihar, Bombay, Madhya Pradesh (formerly Central Provinces and Berar), Madras, Orissa (subsequently renamed Odisha in 2011), Punjab (formerly East Punjab), Uttar Pradesh (formerly the United Provinces), and West Bengal.The eight Part B states were former princely states or groups of princely states, governed by a rajpramukh, who was usually the ruler of a constituent state, and an elected legislature. The rajpramukh was appointed by the President of India. The Part B states were Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Bharat, Mysore, Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU), Rajasthan, Saurashtra, and Travancore-Cochin.The ten Part C states included both the former chief commissioners'  provinces and some princely states, and each was governed by a chief  commissioner appointed by the President of India. The Part C states were  Ajmer, Bhopal, Bilaspur, Coorg, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Kutch, Manipur, Tripura, and Vindhya Pradesh.The sole Part D state was the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which were administered by a lieutenant governor appointed by the central government.So this is how political India looked in 1951Demand for Linguistic StatesDemand of states on linguistic basis was developed even before  independence of India under British rule. Though that time Indian  administrative regions were identified as different provinces. Odisha was the first Indian state formed on linguistic basis in the year 1936 due to the efforts of Madhusudan Das and became Orissa Province. After independence again Political movements for the creation of new,  linguistic-based states developed. The movement to create a Telugu-speaking state out of the northern portion of Madras State gathered strength in the years after independence, and in 1953, the 16  northern, Telugu-speaking districts of Madras State became the new State of Andhra.Other small changes were made to state boundaries during the  1950-1956 period. The small state of Bilaspur was merged with Himachal  Pradesh on 1 July 1954, and Chandernagore, a former enclave of French India, was incorporated into West Bengal in 1955.Then came the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 which restructured the administration of India and was passed on 1st November 1956. Before it came into effect on 1 November, an important amendment to  the Constitution was also enacted; this amendment (the Seventh) was  timed to come into force on the same day.Under the Seventh Amendment, the existing distinction among Part A,  Part B, Part C, and Part D states was abolished. The distinction between  Part A and Part B states was removed, becoming known simply as  ""states"". A new type of entity, the union territory, replaced the  classification as a Part C or Part D state.As per 1956 following were the Indian states:StatesAndhra Pradesh: Andhra State was merged with the Telugu-speaking area of Hyderabad state (also known as Telangana) to create Andhra Pradesh in 1956.Assam: No change of boundary in 1956.Bihar: reduced slightly by the transfer of minor territories to West Bengal.Bombay State: the state was enlarged by the addition of Saurashtra and Kutch, the Marathi-speaking districts of Nagpur Division of Madhya Pradesh, and the Marathi speaking Marathwada region of Hyderabad. The state's southernmost districts of Bombay were  transferred to Mysore State. (In 1960, Bombay State was split into Maharashtra and Gujarat.)Jammu and Kashmir: No change of boundary in 1956.Kerala: formed by the merger of Travancore-Cochin state with the Malabar district of Madras State, Kasaragod of South Canara (Dakshina Kannada). The southern part of Travancore-Cochin, Kanyakumari district was transferred to Madras State.Madhya Pradesh: Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal State were merged into Madhya Pradesh; the Marathi-speaking districts of Nagpur Division were transferred to Bombay State.Madras State: Malabar District was transferred to the new state of Kerala, and a new union territory, Laccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands, was created. The southern part of Travancore-Cochin (Kanyakumari district) was added to the state. (The state was renamed Tamil Nadu in 1968.)Mysore State: enlarged by the addition of Coorg State and the Kannada speaking districts from southern Bombay state and western Hyderabad state. (The state was renamed Karnataka in 1973.)Orissa: No change of boundary in 1956.Punjab: enlarged by addition of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union.Rajasthan: enlarged by the addition of Ajmer state and parts of Bombay and Madhya Bharat states.Uttar Pradesh: No change of boundary in 1956.West Bengal: enlarged by addition of minor territory previously forming part of Bihar.Union territoriesHimachal PradeshAndaman and Nicobar IslandsDelhiLaccadive, Minicoy and Amindivi Islands: created from territory detached from Madras State. (The union territory was renamed as Lakshadweep in 1973.)ManipurTripuraPost 1965- Several new states and union territories have been created out of  existing states since 1956. Bombay State was split into the linguistic  states of Gujarat and Maharashtra on 1 May 1960 by the Bombay Reorganisation Act. Nagaland was made a state on 1 December 1963. The Punjab Reorganisation Act of 1966 divided the Punjab along linguistic lines, creating a new Hindi-speaking state of Haryana on 1 November, transferring the northern districts of Punjab to Himachal Pradesh, and designating Chandigarh, the shared capital of Punjab and Haryana, a union territory.Statehood was conferred upon Himachal Pradesh on 25 January 1971, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura on 21 January 1972. The Kingdom of Sikkim joined the Indian Union as a state on 26 April 1975. In 1987, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram became states on 20 February, followed by Goa on 30 May, while Goa's northern exclaves of Daman and Diu became a separate union territory.In 2000 three new states were created; Chhattisgarh (1 November 2000) was created out of eastern Madhya Pradesh, Uttaranchal (9 November 2000), which was renamed Uttarakhand in 2007, was created out of the Hilly regions of northwest Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand (15 November 2000) was created out of the southern districts of Bihar.In 2014, the new state of Telangana was carved out from the North-Western regions of the state of Andhra Pradesh. The city of Hyderabad became the joint capital of the two states for the period not exceeding 10 years after which Andhra Pradesh gets new capital.Demand for new states turn up every other day as there is no exact distinction for the division of states. So we have to wait and see what come out of these demands.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"I know this person is mentioned already by Mr Pallav Gupta, though i would still like to extend to his legacy in bollywood by the following article: Talent List:Acting– Check.Singing– Check.Screenplay and Dialogues– Check.Script writing– Check.Lyricist– Check.I’m not sure if one article would be enough to describe this man. Yet, very few people would actually know him. Born on 13th  January 1963 in the city of Gwalior as Priyakansha Sharma, he later  went on to graduate from the National School of Drama, Delhi in the year  1986. Initially, his parents admitted him to Carmel Convent School,  Gwalior, thinking that his education in a convent will help him excel in  academics. But it was activities like singing, painting and acting  which appealed to him. In spite of the appreciation he was beginning to  receive in the theatre circles, his family wanted him to only  concentrate on his studies. He took the entrance test to the National  School of Drama, New Delhi in 1983, not with any particular desire to  study but to get out of Gwalior. And since then, there has been no  looking back for him.Since our guy here has delved deep into so many fields, I would prefer to shed some light on each of these fields:ActingIf you remember him, I am sure it is because of his extended role in Gangs of Wasseypur as Nasir or in Rockstar, where  he played the role of a music producer . But this is not all that he  has done as an actor. Mishra won accolades for his performance as Kaka  in Vishal Bhardwaj’s 2003 film Maqbool, an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Mishra again appeared in Anurag Kashyap’s 2009 movie Gulaal,  a movie based on Indian youth, politics, caste-prejudice, and other  such social topics. He played Prithvi, the poet brother of ‘Dukey Bana’  (played by Kay Kay Menon), in the movie….a role he executed with aplomb.  According to his IMDB page, he has been part of a movie as an actor, 25  times till now. Most of them have been supporting roles. But no  supporting actor delivers performances with as much excellence as he  does.Piyush Mishra in MaqboolLyricistAll of you must have heard of the song  “Arre Ruk Ja Re Bandeh”. Yes. You’re right. That ‘Indian Ocean’ song.  But very few would know that he wrote the lyrics for that song, which  appeared for the  first time along with credits of the 2004 Anurag  Kashyap movie, Black Friday. He has also contributed as a lyricist for many of the songs in Gangs of Wasseypur.  ‘Husna’ and ‘Ghar’, two of Coke Studio’s best compositions have been  written by him. He has worked with maestros like ‘Illayaraja’ in Chal Chalein.Dialogue and Screenplay WriterThe Legend of Bhagat Singh  (2002) where Ajay Devgan played Bhagat Singh was a disaster at the box  office. But it gathered a lot of rave reviews. It also won the National  Award that year for the Best Regional Film (Hindi). Piyush Mishra wrote  the dialogues for the film. He also wrote the screenplay for Yahaan (2005), Lahore (2010) and Chittagong (2011). He was the one behind the powerful dialogues of movies like Ghajini (2008) and Agneepath (2012).SingingHe lent his voice for a bunch of critically acclaimed songs. ‘Aarambh hai prachand’ and ‘Duniya’ are some of his initial works as a singer from Gulaal. After that, he sang ‘Ik Bagal’ and ‘Aabroo’ in Gangs of Wasseypur.  He has sung a couple of songs in MTV’s reputed show, Coke Studio. My  favourite among his songs is ‘Husna’. He has written the lyrics himself.  This song is a letter from Javed who was separated from his lover Husna  during the partition.[youtube url=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zTFzMPWGLs”]Also, recently you all must have been  watching the Google’s Ad campaign on television. The Reunion Song there  has also been sung by Piyush Mishra.[youtube url=”Page on youtube.com]AwardsPiyush Mishra bagged the Best Actor award at Julien Dubuque International Film Festival in the year 2014 for his movie The Playback Singer.He also won the award for Best Dialogues for the movie The Legend of Bhagat Singh at Zee Cine Awards.At Zee Cine Awards 2013, we was also nominated for the award of Best Supporting Actor for his fine performance in Gangs of Wasseypur.Future EndeavorsHe is writing for the much discussed Karan Johar’s next, Shhuddhi and Traffic . Both are due to be released in the later half of this year.He is also a very respected member of  the industry. We would like him to continue his great work in all the  different fields that he is a part of.originally posted on http://www.deraileddouchebaggery...",high,high,high,high,low

Pratik-Jha-3,"So here we are talking about two absolute gems of the Game of Thrones. I personally am a big fan of both the characters and thoroughly believe that both of them will have a huge role to play in the ""game"" till the end.The answer to the difference between these characters lie in the difference of history they had.Before diving in, I just want to make clear one of my operating  premises: I do not take either man at their word.  This is probably more  simple to see with LittleFinger, who lies for the same reasons a ""bear shits in  the woods,"" according to Tyrion.  The same with Varys, though in Varys'  case, I think we see more instances of ""not the whole truth,"" perhaps,  rather than outright lies.  Either way, I am of the firm opinion that  certain things Varys has said that are often taken at face value (i.e.  ""I hate magic"" and ""for the realm"") are also lies/ half truths.Little FingerDespite the image that LittleFinger himself tries to cultivate in terms of being  “self made,” good Petyr Baelish was born to a noble family in the  Fingers.  His great-grandfather was born in Braavos, and came to the  Vale to serve as a sellsword in Lyn Corbray’s company.  LittleFinger’s grandfather  was knighted, and the Baelishes enjoyed the status of landed  aristocracy since then, albeit at a lower rung on the hierarchy than  most of the other characters we meet.Nevertheless, LittleFinger was raised  at Riverrun as Lord Hoster’s ward, and enjoyed the same upbringing and  benefits as every other member of the high nobility. He even shared the  same relationship with the Blackfish the other kids did as a confidant, a  father figure, and a shoulder to cry on.  The boy was loved, and each  of the Tully kids treated him as a brother and friend.At the age  of 15, LittleFinger challenged Brandon Stark for Cat’s hand.  The scene is  detailed in Cat VII of a Game of Thrones, but in brief, LittleFinger was the aggressor, and  Brandon did all he could to avoid the fight. LittleFinger was not remotely  “bullied” or “abused” as it has been suggested, but rather, he  challenged Brandon to a duel and lost spectacularly.  Brandon purposely  went easy on him, removed his own armor to make it a fairer fight, and  kept asking LittleFinger to yield, so it’s LittleFinger’s own breath-taking idiocy that  resulted in his injury.  While recovering at Riverrun, Lysa slept with  him under the pretense of being Cat.  Two weeks later, Hoster sent him  back to the Fingers, away from his daughters.  Lysa became pregnant with LittleFinger’s child, and was forced to drink an abortificant by her father.  When LittleFinger was 19/ 20, Jon Arryn put him in charge of customs at the Vale at  Lysa’s behest.  He raised revenue three fold, and Lysa again nominated  his appointment at KingsLanding.  Three years after coming to KingsLanding, he was made  Master of Coin, and raised the Crown’s revenues “ten-fold….” while  creating a record-breaking deficit. It’s worth pointing out that  his ties to Lysa have been just as, if not more, important as his own  “talents” in his social movement.VarysVarys was born in Lys, according  to Pycelle.  According to Varys, he was an orphan in travelling with a  mummer troupe, performing around the Free Cities, Kings Landing and  Oldtown.  When still quite young in Myr, a “certain man” asked the  mummer master to use Varys.  This man threw Varys’ “manly parts” to the  flame, causing the flames to turn blue and apparently answering in a  language Varys claims not to have understood.  He tells Tyrion that he  hates magic because of this, but like everything Varys says, this  alleged hatred should be questioned.After the ritual, the  mummers had already left, so Varys remained in Myr.  He sold his body  and became a thief to survive.  After some years pass, Varys flees Myr  to Pentos due to pressure from a rival thief, where he meets Illyrio, a  poor sellsword at the time.  At this point, Varys hires Illyrio for  protection, and the two men team up to become highly competent con-men.   They run a business in which Varys steals things from other thieves,  and Illyrio charges the owners a “finder’s fee” for selling these stolen  goods back.They begin to employ “mice” (later referred to as  “birds”), as children are more dependable and attract even less  suspicion.  After a while, Varys realizes that secrets and spying is far  more lucrative than material goods, so they re-brand their “company” to  one based around blackmail and intrigue. Varys teaches the mice how to  read, and they start dealing in letters, secrets and information (these  guys really understand how to maximize profits).  Through this system,  Illyrio grows so “respectable” that a cousin of the Prince of Pentos  marries him to his daughter, so ostensibly both men have made a killing.Apparently,  Varys’ renown as a master of whispers reached Westeros, where King  Aerys requested his presence at court by name.  I have always wondered  precisely why and how the gossip about Varys’ talents at spying reached  Aerys, and I think this is a point to question in the future.  At any  rate, he ended up in Aerys employ, charged with figuring out treasons at  Aerys’ behest.The Defiance of Duskendale is usually taken as  Aerys’ turning point of sanity, and used as “proof” that Varys is  pro-Targaryen since he was supposedly not responsible for the most  significant blow to Aerys’ sanity.  It might be worth noting that in  a Feast Fof Crows Brienne chapter, we learn that the people blame Lady Serala, Lord  Denys’ Myrish wife, for the defiance: “The Lace  Serpent filled her husband’s ear with Myrish poison, they say, until  Lord Denys rose against his king and took him captive.”   It may mean  nothing that Serala (which sounds suspiciously close to Serra, Illyrio’s  wife) is from Myr, where Varys had lived much of his life, and that she  is held responsible for the defiance, but I thought this connection  deserved mention.He is credited for raising Aerys’ already  increased paranoia by suggesting to Aerys that Rhaegar would try to  overtake the throne during the Tourney at Harrenhal, which prompted  Aerys to attend- his first public appearance since Duskendale.  He also  counseled Aerys to not open the gates for Tywin, while Pycelle urged  Aerys to let Tywin in.So to conclude what I believe is that Varys person who looks like one with long term elaborate plans. Plans where he would have to lose first, suffer first, but come out all guns blazing at the end.On the contrary LittleFinger seems to be a more fickle minded person who is less likely to be loyal to person, group or even a plan for long.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"his is my list of top 10 free kick takers in the world of all time. (considering each player at his prime)10. RonaldinhoMost free-kick takers excel at only one method of shooting. Ronaldinho could do it all. Power, curve, touch, creativity—you name it. Just watch the video and you'll see examples of every kind of free kick. His  kick underneath the wall against Werder Bremen was genius and serves as  a reminder of how great he was during his heyday. It's a shame that  period didn't last any longer9.Alessandro Del PieroA Juventus legend, Alessandro Del Piero's placement of the ball was absolutely amazing. His curve and power were both very good, but it was where he put the ball that made all the difference. One  of the most underrated players of his era, Del Piero was truly a great  player who remained loyal to his club even during the days of  Calciopoli. Now playing in Indian Super League, Del Piero can still bend it like, well, someone else you'll find later on this list.8. Diego Maradona                   You might not have known this, but the little guy knew how to score from free kicks. Maradona  might have been most famous for his dazzling runs, he was also an  expert when it came to set pieces. Relying on his touch and ability to  curl the ball, he scored a lot of goals from free kicks for team and  country. His ability on set pieces is yet another reason why Maradona might be the greatest player of all time.            7. Zinédine Zidane                   The video included is a tutorial by Zinédine Zidane on how to take  penalties and free kicks (the latter starts at about four-and-a-half  minutes). So for all of you aspiring masters of the free kick: This is  your chance to learn from one of the best. Zidane had an  incredible conversion rate on free kicks that weren't too far away from  goal. He had ice in his veins and reminded all of France of another  master of the free kick that we'll find on this list.            6. Roberto Carlos                     Carlos was  responsible for some of the most spectacular free-kick goals in history,  like the one shown here against France, but his conversion rate wasn't  the highest. He relied on power and effect to get the ball past the keeper, and more often than not the ball would end up in the stands. But that power was incredible. After stopping this bomb, Gianluigi Buffon told the media he thought that the ball had broken his arm, as it hurt so much when it struck.5. Sinisa Mihajlovic                   A controversial player with an explosive personality, no one can deny Sinisa Mihajlovic's proficiency at taking free kicks. The  Serbian still holds the record for most ever scored in the Serie A.  What makes that even more impressive is the fact Mihajlovic was a  defender. Mihajlovic was an elite power kicker who could curve the ball around or over any wall.            4. Zico                   The original master of the free kick, Zico was the first player to turn taking set pieces into an art form. Opponents were bewildered as they marveled at the consistency with which he put the ball past their goalkeeper. Zico became the benchmark for everyone who followed, and while he might no longer be the greatest, he was the first true master.            3. David Beckham                   The man who inspired a (really bad) teen flick and kick-started Keira Knightley's career. David Beckham's free kicks are a thing of legend. His touch on the ball and his ability to curve his shot are mind blowing. But  what might be most remarkable is his consistency and his ability to  step up when his team needs him. Those are the marks of a truly great  player. The craziest thing is that he's not even the greatest  free-kick specialist of his era. You'll have to read on to figure out  who that is.            2. Andrea PirloThe Italian maestro is known all over the world for his incredible vision, but he is also a great free kick exponent. Pirlo  resurrected his career after moving to Juventus and in the process  guided Italy to the finals of Euro 2012 which included a perfectly timed  free kick against Croatia.1. Juninho PernambucanoAs if there was ever any doubt about who would be No. 1. Juninho is  the greatest free-kick taker of all time, and it's not even close. His technique is called ""knuckleballing,"" which makes the ball fly through the air without any spin. As a result, the ball wobbles in every direction, making it almost impossible to stop.  Juninho didn't bother about the distance to the goal. His try would probably find the back of the net anyway. I  could talk about his ability for hours, but I think the video says it  all. Even if you skipped through this answer without bothering to watch  any of the videos, watch this one. It'll blow your mind.Honorable mentions:Steven GerrardCristiano RonaldoMicheal PlatiniThierry HenryPlease comment with you opinions in case of a disagreement.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"For me Premier League is much better both in terms of football and entertainment.BPL has a tougher competition, not talking only about the top 4-5 teams, but all 20 the teams in general. Last 10-20 years have a seen a lot relegation zone premier league teams defeat tittle contenders which is absent in the La Liga.Building on the previous point, the 20 teams in the EPL bring in  different styles of play, making EPL a much more entertaining league to  watch. La Liga may have notched some high scorelines, but that’s because  a Real Madrid or a Barcelona found a very weak team to swat. When you  watch a La Liga game, you know that the game will be open, which makes  it easy for the teams with all the superstars to beat the lower placed  teams. But in the EPL, you have different styles to watch out  for, so throughout the season, managers have to keep changing their  tactics based on the team they play. If a team plays only one way no  matter the opposition, they’ll soon get found out, as Arsenal have  experienced for so many seasons now. Some teams attack, some teams  defend, some teams try to bring a mix. But for the fans, and especially  the neutrals, it’s a fantastic viewing experience. EPL has fairer distribution of TV money More than ticket sales, clubs now depend on tv money, as broadcasters  pay quite a hefty amount to be able to show the games to fans from all  over the world. In the case of La Liga, the teams get to make their own  deals with the TV companies, and so the bigger teams like Real Madrid  and Barcelona end up getting a bigger slice of the money. For example, a couple of season ago, Real Madrid earned a massive 140 million Euros from its TV deal while Granada earned only 12 million Euros.  At the same time, Manchester City made 60 million pounds whereas  relegated Blackburn made 40 million pounds. The disparity between the  top and bottom teams is a lot lesser making it a much fairer fight  between the two.Stadium Attendance: The number of people  that attend the games, even for the lowest clubs, is far higher on  average in the EPL when compared to the La Liga. This could be tempered  by the fact that stadiums in the La Liga have a much lesser capacity,  but that just proves the point that there are more people that go to  watch matches in the EPL than there are in the La Liga. According to  figures from ESPN, 11 EPL sides had an average of more than 30,000  people attending the games while it was only 7 sides that could do that.  Even more telling, there was no EPL side that averaged less than 20,000  while as many as 9 La Liga sides fell below that figure. Even a mid table battle at the end of the season attracts about 30000 people on the ground.Global Coverage:EPL has a much wider audience on the global scale, with fans follwing  the top teams from as far away as Asia and Africa. Even teams like  Fulham, that is presently in a lower division, go to pre-season tours to  the United States of America and attract a decent crowd. That cannot be  said of La Liga, barring of course, Real Madrid and Barcelona. Every  season, there are new markets opening up for the EPL, which is partly  due to the marketing done by the management of the league. Fans from all  over the world take time out once a year to come to England and watch  their favorite teams play.Relegation battles: Relegation battles in the premier league are far better than La Liga or any other league. Relegation battles in the Premier league are highly discussed by media and fans. The relegation battling teams have almost full capacity crowd in matches, which cannot be said about La Liga.Better Highlight and review shows: Match of the day on BBC1 is something that had a huge role in what BPL is now. For me and a lot more people will agree that MOTD is by far the best show for weekly football reviews across all the leagues. None of the La Liga shows have been able to match the popularity of MOTD. (Sky Sports' Monday Night Football is also catching up nicely with MOTD but that too in turns is a BPL review show.",high,high,high,high,low

Pratik-Jha-3,"So here is one my favorite songs, which is a ghazal beautifully sung by Ghulam Ali, written byAkbar Allahabadi ""Hungama Hai Kyun Barpa Thodi Sii Jo Pii Lii Hai""Listen to it first and then allow me to take this beauty to a very different level.Hungama hai kyun barpa thodi sii jo pii lii haiiIs one of those ghazals which is sung or played at boisterous parties where wine is flowing.For very long I wasn't even aware that it was by Akbar Allahabadi, an extremely religious and strait laced man.Very few are aware of the context in which the ""teetotaler"" Akbar Allahabadi, a very devout Muslim, wrote it.I stumbled upon this article Hungama Hai Kyon BarpaAfter reading this article I did some research and then reached the  conclusion that this was a plausible interpretation of the ghazal.Akbar Allahabadi^  was born in  1846 and lived through turbulent times,  witnessing the first war of independence in 1857, World war I  and even  the initial part of Gandhi's peaceful movement. He died in 1921 in  Allahabad.Akbar Allahabadi was a spectator to the post 1857 ‘divide and rule’  policies of the British.  He opposed the British policies and the  decadence of the Indian culture through his satirical verses. Most of  his topics addressed the moral, social and religious issues in the  Indian and particularly Muslim community. He talked of the cynicism of  the political leaders of the time and their doubles speak:Akbar used humour to convey his messages and his verse to be read  between the lines and in the social and historical context of the times  too.The fall out of the Khilafat* Movement exacerbated the already growing  rift and led to the drifting apart of Hindus and Muslims with many  Muslims aligning themselves with Muslim league. This growing distance between the Hindus and Muslims of India perturbed  Akbar Allahabadi and he advocated Hindu – Muslim unity. By then Muslim  league was growing in power and was completely at odds with the  Congress.  His attempts at propagating Hindu- Muslim unity led to  allegations that Akbar had been bribed / influenced by the Hindus and  perchance seduced by alcohol.  Though in Urdu shayri alcohol was taken  as a symbol of devotion here Akbar is equating it to love for a  community which permits drinking as opposed to Islam which prohibits it.Akbar often used allegory and symbols in his poetry to convey a much  deeper message than the one we read superficially. As Prof S R Farooqui  explains in his Firaq memorial lecture*. Farooqi on Akbar Allahabadi, The Milli Gazette, Vol. 2 No. 24The verse “ uss mai se nahi matlab “ is a reference to the intoxication  of power , resulting in  the  hateful divisiveness of those days, and  leading ultimately to partition. Thankfully Akbar didn’t live to see  that day.Hungaama hai kyun barpa thodi sii jo pii lii haiDaaka tau nahin daala, chori tau nahin kii hai(Why the furore if a wee bit imbibed have I, Neither have I looted nor robbed anyone have I)( this 'mai' could be said to be the 'milk of human kindness""Naa tajurbaa kaari se vaaiz ki yeh baatein hainIs rang ko kyaa jaane pooch tau kabhi pii hai?Naa Tajurbaa kaari : inexperience Vaaiz : preacher (The inexperience of the preacher reflects in these insinuationsHow could he recognise this hue, ask has he ever tasted it?Uss mai se nahin matlab dil jis se ho begaanaMaqsuud hai uss mai se dil mein jo khinchti haiMai : wine Maqsuud : intended,proposed,intent,designBegaanaa : a stranger,foreigner,not related(Useless is the wine which is a stranger to my heartI seek the wine which springs forth from my own heart)Vaa’n  dil mein  ki sadame do yaa’n  jii mein ke sab sah lo Un kaa bhii ajab dil hai meraa bhii ajab jii haiAjab : wonder,astonishment,wonderful,amazing(There the intent to hurt, here to bear itHer heart is also amazing and mine also astonisheshar zarraa chamaktaa hai anvaar-e-ilaahii se har saans ye kahtii hai ham hain to Khuda bhii haizarra : an atom, a particleAnvaar e ilaahi : Brilliance of God (Every speck is illuminated by Divine brillianceEvery breath proclaims, I am here is a testimony to God’s existence )Suraj mein lage dhabbaa fitrat ke karishme hain but ham ko kahe kaafir Allah kii marzii haiFitrat : creation, natureKarishma : a wonder, miracle, a charmBut : idol, beloved Kaafir : non believer, infidel, impious person, sweetheart,(The specks on the sun are Nature’s miracleThe idol calls me an infidel, tis God’s will)Next time you hear this ghazal it would surely be a different experience.",high,high,high,high,low

It's a movie about two of the greatest F1 drivers of their generation Niki Lauda and James Hunt. How everything talks about the long lasting rift and rivalry between them, but we fail to notice the respect they had for each other.  This movie also covers the tragic disaster Niki Lauda had to face during 1976 German Grand Prix, which burnt half his face and almost killed him. But he came back and their rivalry was what accelerated his recovery. The best thing about this movie IMO is the casting. Every single actor cast in this movie is perfect, he matches the character description, has a similar air around them and have similar accents (more or less). Brilliantly captures the exhilaration that comes from facing death head-on. It's also an ode to joyous rivalry.

Pratik-Jha-3,"For me one of the most badass Indians, is Kumara Samy Kamaraj aka  K. Kamaraj ""the King Maker"". Since we are talking about after-Independence, I'll start his story after 1950. On 13 April 1954, K. Kamaraj became the Chief Minister of Madras  Province. To everyone’s surprise, Kamaraj nominated C. Subramaniam and  M. Bhakthavatsalam, who had contested his leadership, to the newly  formed cabinet. (In todays world it would be like Narendra Modi inviting Lal Krishna Adwani to join his cabinet). On 2 October 1963, he resigned from the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Post.  He proposed that all senior Congress leaders should resign from their  posts and devote all their energy to the re-vitalization of the  Congress (at that time, congress~government).In 1963 he suggested to Nehru that senior Congress leaders should leave  ministerial posts to take up organisational work. This suggestion came  to be known as the Kamaraj Plan, which was designed primarily to dispel  from the minds of Congressmen the lure for power, creating in its place a  dedicated attachment to the objectives and policies of the  organisation. Well impressed by the achievements and acumen of Kamraj, Prime Minister  Jawaharlal Nehru felt that his services were needed more at the national  level. In a swift move he brought Kamaraj to Delhi as the President of  the Indian National Congress. Nehru realised that if he had wide  learning and vision, Kamaraj possessed enormous common sense and  pragmatism.Kamaraj gave a simple advice to his ministers, “Face the problem. Don’t  evade it. Find a solution, however small. People will be satisfied if  you do something.” Followed by him a number of Central and State  ministers likeLal Bahadur Shastri, Jagjivan Ram, Satyendra Narayan  Sinha, Morarji Desaiand S.K. Patil followed suit and resigned from their  posts. In 1963, Kamaraj was elected ‘Congress President’ and he  successfully navigated the party and the nation through the stormy years  following Nehru’s death. Kamaraj’s political maturity came in full view  when Nehru died in 1964. How he settled the succession issue for the  Prime Ministership was amply proved by his choice of Lal Bahadur Shastri  and Indira Gandhi in succession. He could have easily have been India's next PrimeMinister but he decided to be the KingMaker instead.When Kamaraj died he left with a paiseless just owned a pair of  chappels dozen of Books, his family was in poor condition even the house  was taken by the state. He live like a hermit, died as a simple man. It was on the birth Day of Gandhi, another ‘KALA GANDHI” as he was famously called,  breathed his last.",high,high,high,high,low

It surely lies behind the likes of Barca, or Bayern or Manchester City. Midfield: Veratti, Moura, Pastore, Matuidi, etc. Their midfield do lack a bit of Champion's League experience, but this talented bunch looks great when they click together. Defence: Silva, Luiz, Marchinos, Maxwell, etc. This is where they have ample experience and quality. Though Luiz on his day can be as bad as it gets. They will have to depend on their defense in the later parts of the tournament, when they face bigger teams. That will be their true test, though I believe their defense i only second to Juventus or City (when Kompany is in form).What stops them from winning the coveted trophy is that lack serious competition in the league. There is not team (may be Marselie or Monaco on their day) in the league that can challenge them to their limits. When it comes to Champions League semi-finals and finals, they might have to be the second best team on the pitch and still win it. They are not accustomed to doing that in the League.

Pratik-Jha-3,"I think he will be a really good singning for City. We can see a ideology shift in the Manchester City club which had almost 5 forwards last season (Aguero, Bony, Negredo, Dzeko, Jovetic) but now they look like a team build on its midfied, with signings of Sterling, and contract extention of Nasri. DeBruyne is product of this ideology shift. IMO DeBruyne is player who is there for City to do better in the Champions League.(Though he'll play a lot in premier League too) For the past few seasons City have been guilty of keeping the midfield-gaps for the important games in the Champios League. With DeBruyne now City has good solid 5 man midfield for the importnat big games in the Champions League (They have to face Barcelona sometime, its their destiny). Another thing City lacked a bit last year was versetality, Dzeko could only play as a target man, Navas is only good on the right wing, hugging the touch line, Silva is not quite his own when played on the wings, Toure suits the box-to-box role the best. With Sterling and DeBruyne they have increased the versatility. Regular Starting 11 (4-2-3-1)Sterling and Aguero can play up front (second half vs Everton). (4-4-2)Solid Mid field for big away games in Premier League (4-3-3).Packed Mid field for Champions League big games. (4-5-1)Against Counter attacking teams (4-1-4-1)The reason DeBryune could not make his name is Chelsea because he has a nack of trying to dribble past a bunch of players, and hence loose the ball in midfield. This is something players can do in other leagues, but in English top division the defence is packed, hence less space to dribble past players.Pellegrini has a big role to play as a man manager to tackle this problem of his. I would expect Debruyne to have a larger impact and playing time in Champions League games than the domestic matches for this season.",high,high,high,high,low

Pratik-Jha-3,"For me the best delivery in cricket history is this Shane Warne's absolute gem to Mike Gatting. gif:Sickest Leg Break ever Allow me to break it down for you.The BuildupWarne had only played 11 games before this, and this was his first game against England, his Ashes debut. He was building a reputation as a very dangerous bowler, and in the lead up to the game the English had been talking him down. Australia had batted first and made a sub par score, and the English had  batted quite well for a few hours before Warne came on to bowl.Facing him was the veteran English batsman Mike Gatting, a former captain, one of the  greats of the game and a man known for his absolute discipline while  batting. He was one of the best players of spin bowling in the world at  the time. The Ball itselfThis was the first ball that Warne bowled in the game. Everything  about it was perfect, but what was the most remarkable thing about it is  that it ""drifted"" in the air - moving from left to right - in the last  few feet before bouncing. This happens occasionally in cricket when the  bowler spins the ball exceptionally hard through the air. Some can do  it, most can't.When batting, the batsman moves his front leg to where the ball will  bounce, and transfers his weight to that leg when striking the ball. The  front foot is the most important part of batting - you build your  entire defence around it. The combination of front leg, bat and back leg  should cover the stumps completely, not allowing the ball to get  through.In the GIF/video, you can see the batsman make a last minute adjustment as  the ball ""drifts"" a few inches to his left from its original trajectory.  As the ball drifts, it also ""dips"", falling an inch or so shorter of  where it normally would. The batsman places his leg where it will  bounce, so that the ball will hit his leg and not go through and hit the  stumps. By drifting and dipping, the batsman realises at the last  minute that his foot is no where near where it should be, and he quickly  tries to adjust.After bouncing, the ball spins back viciously, in the opposite  direction to its drift, evading both the batsman's front leg, then his  bat, then his back leg before going on and hitting the very top left  hand corner of the stumps. The margin for error is zero.This is sublime skill of a level rarely seen in world sport. It is  pure deception - a one ball examination and exploitation of a technique  ranked at the very top of the game. To do it in your first ball in the  biggest game of your career is amazing.",high,high,high,high,low

Pratik-Jha-3,"tl;dr: Patriarchy isn't just doing harm to females but it is harming the men as well. What I believe that feminists are aiming apart from the safety and security of women is curbing the patriarchal nature of the society.  We men also have female members in our family, friends and we obliviously want their safety and equal rights.But a very important fact that many of us fail to acknowledge is that patriarchy and male-chauvinism is doing harm to the males of the society too. This is what the patriarchal “ideal” of male toughness and  invulnerability based society does to men: Men are often expected to endure hazardous conditions, with  the  attitude that any expression of fear is a sign of weakness.  This  means  that men are likely to find themselves in dangerous jobs, or in  risky  physical conflicts ranging from fist fights to actual  combat.Men are often afraid to admit emotional weakness, making them  less  likely to seek help for depression and other mental health issues,  or  to be accurately diagnosed, which increases their suffering with these  conditions.  Perhaps as a  result, men are more likely to commit suicide  than women.Men are less likely to seek medical help when they have a  physical  problem (due to their idea of male toughness) , leading to unnecessary suffering and, at times,  death.Men are more likely to attempt to “prove” their toughness  with risky acts that sometimes lead to injury and death.Instead of emotionally engaging the pain they feel due to  racism,  poverty, and colonization, many men feel compelled to show  “toughness.”   This prevents effective resistance movements.Violence aimed at boys is likely to be ignored or dismissed  by adults, leading to increased acceptance of bullying.Many men feel compelled to prove their dominance over others  by using violence.  Men are more likely to face a  serious physical assault or murder than  women, and this violence is  almost always at the hands of another man.Many men spend their lives deeply lonely, as they find  themselves  unable to relate to others emotionally, and feel constant  pressure to  exert dominance over each person they encounter. (And trust me being vulnerable to loved one is a great feeling, and many men miss that.)A culture that idealizes dominance rather than cooperation  and  partnership cannot imagine other models for living.  This means that   any elements of difference between two groups will be used to determine   “superiority” and “inferiority,” dominance and submission.  Racism,   homophobia, trans phobia, fat phobia feel quite natural to   those raised in such a culture, and the harm to men in oppressed groups   due to these forces is immeasurable.Many men will never allow themselves to have meaningful friendships  with any of the millions of women or non-gender conforming men in the  world—people who could have made them laugh, nurtured their growth as  human beings, or just been lots of fun.  This shrinks men’s lives  drastically.The idea of male dominance and chauvinism leads men to be sexually and emotionally unsatisfied with their partner(s). Patriarchy for them makes relationships about dominance rather than intimacy and romance which leads to emotional and physical frustration.If it weren’t for patriarchy, men wouldn’t feel so differentiated to women,  and women wouldn’t be nearly so afraid of them.  That would  mean that women would be a lot more likely to be willing to spend time  with men they didn’t know, and a lot more comfortable having sex with  them if they wanted to. (side note: a very good read ""How patriarchy reduces male sexual life ""Discrimination against women in education and employment means that   everyone, men included, is negatively affected by less  qualified   individuals dominating certain careers.  This could mean everything from  a diminished dining experience due to male domination of restaurant  kitchens to the reduced likelihood of a cure for cancer due to male  domination of the sciences.Most men never enjoy the type of intense family connections  they  are capable of, and will never have a chance to enjoy some of the  most  fulfilling aspects of life (small moments connecting with children,  the  satisfaction of creating a beautiful living space,  etc.).To a quote a small observation form my native country India, the amount of men that take their own lives (suicides) due to the inability to provide for their family is gigantic. These number for similar females are negligible. The patriarchal notion of  ""being a man"" and ""growing a pair"" puts immense pressure on men to be the bread earner in the house without asking help even from their partners. This forces men to breach their physical and emotional safety. There is so much more,  I could spend days expanding this list  forever. Due to patriarchy, men will find themselves  in situations  where being a man causes them real problems and  disadvantages. In the end, the small relative advantages men gain are dwarfed by much larger disadvantages  and reduced  quality of life that they face due to patriarchy.There are male feminists because they believe feminism is not about female-centrality, or defaming men, it is about quality, harmony and considering everyone human rather than their gender.",high,high,high,high,low

(side note: a very good read ""How patriarchy reduces male sexual life ""Discrimination  against women in education and employment means that   everyone, men  included, is negatively affected by less  qualified   individuals  dominating certain careers.  This could mean everything from  a  diminished dining experience due to male domination of restaurant   kitchens to the reduced likelihood of a cure for cancer due to male   domination of the sciences.Most  men never enjoy the type of intense family connections  they  are  capable of, and will never have a chance to enjoy some of the  most   fulfilling aspects of life (small moments connecting with children,   the  satisfaction of creating a beautiful living space,  etc.).To  a quote a small observation form my native country India, the amount of  men that take their own lives (suicides) due to the inability to  provide for their family is gigantic. These number for similar females  are negligible. The patriarchal notion of  ""being a man"" and ""growing a  pair"" puts immense pressure on men to be the bread earner in the house  without asking help even from their partners. This forces men to breach  their physical and emotional safety. There  is so much more,  I could spend days expanding this list  forever. Due  to patriarchy, men will find themselves  in situations  where being a  man causes them real problems and  disadvantages. In the end, the small  relative advantages men gain are dwarfed by much larger disadvantages   and reduced  quality of life that they face due to patriarchy.Had written a similar answer to the question: Pratik Jha's answer to Why are there male feminists?",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"1. The sound of OM encompasses all words, all sounds in human language OM is a matrix of all sounds, when in its diversified form gives rise to all words used in language. Linguistically,  all audible sounds are produced in the space within the mouth beginning  at the root of the tongue and ending at the lips. The throat sound is  A, and M is the lip sound; and the sound U represents the rolling  forward of speech articulation which starts at the root of the tongue,  continuing until it ends in the lips. To pronounce OM correctly, remember, the sound vibration is pronounced “oom” as in home. 2. AUM and OM In  Sanskrit, the sound “O” is a diphthong spelled “AU”. A diphthong is the  blending of two vowel sounds where both are normally heard and make a  gliding sound. As a result, the difference between OM and AUM is simply  one of transliteration. 3. AUM represents the 3 Fold Division of Time             A – is the waking state            U – is the dream state            M – is the state of deep sleep At the end of AUM is a pause, a silence. This represents the state known as Turiya, or Infinite Consciousness 4. The visual symbol represents the meaning of AUM The symbol OM visually consists of three curves, one semicircle, and a dot. The large bottom curve symbolizes the waking state, A.The middle curve signifies the dream state, U.The upper curve denotes the state of deep sleep, M. The dot signifies the fourth state of consciousness, Turiya. The  semi circle at the top represents Maya and separates the dot from the  other three curves. It signals to us that it is the illusion of Maya  that is an obstacle to realization of the Highest. 5. OM is associated with Ganesha The physical form of Lord Ganesha is said to be that of OM.  The upper curve, of OM, is identified with  the head or the face of Ganesh. The Lower curve his belly.

Pratik-Jha-3,"House Targaryen:Blackfyre: One of the two Valyrian steel blades belonging to House Targaryen. This sword was wielded by Aegon I during the wars of conquest. It was passed down to the heirs apparent  throughout the years until Aegon IV (The Unworthy) gave the sword to his  bastard son Daemon after he had demonstrated great prowess in battle.  This was seen by many to be Aegon's recognition of Daemon as his son and  his intention for Daemon to succeed him instead of his trueborn heir  Daeron. This matter was further complicated by Aegon IV legitimizing all  his bastards on his death bed. Daemon took the name Blackfyre as his  surname and led the Blackfyre Rebellion against House Targaryen. The  sword has since been lost.Dark Sister: The second of the two Valyrian steel blades owned by House Targaryen. It was wielded by Visenya, sister wife to Aegon I.  The sword was also wielded by the famed Prince Aemon the Dragonknight.  The last known owner of the sword was one of Aegon IV's great bastards,  Brynden Rivers (Bloodraven).House Lannister:Brightroar: The ancestral Valyrian Greatsword of House Lannister. It was lost when  Tommen II, King of the Rock, sailed to Valyria and failed to return. As  such House Lannister has been without a Valyrian steel blade for  centuries, much to the chagrin of Tywin Lannister the current patriarch. Tywin Lannister has tried to purchase swords  from minor houses, but these poor houses are loathe to part with their  heirlooms. House Dane:Dawn: This is the blade of House Dayne. it is not Valyrian but is carved from a  meteorite. It carries a few of the same properties of Valyrian steel.  Dawn was wielded by the famous Ser Arthur Dayne of the Kingsguard and given back by Ned Stark to Asahra Dane.House Tarly:Heartsbane: This is the ancestral Valyrian steel sword of House Tarly. It is a  two-handed greatsword. It has been in the family for 500 years. Its  current owner is Lord Randyll Tarly.House Stark:Ice: The ancestral blade of House Stark,  this weapon is a two handed Valyrian greatsword with a unique pattern  of dark ripples where you can see the steel folded over thousands of  times. Ned Stark was executed by Ser Ilyn Payne with Ice.  Ser Ilyn Payne is the owner of Ice for some time after that.

For the past few years this love has been one sided, but with the draws as this season, it seems that we can expect better from English teams this season. Chelsea: Lets start with the the Champions of England. They are grouped with Porto, Kyiv and Maccabi in group G and its looks like they will have less trouble reaching the top of the group. But they have huge travel times and with the jet lags their squad depth will be tested. They need to sort out after their miserable start, players like Hazard and Cesc will have to step up, quarterfinals IMO. Manchester City: Probably the best squad in England as we speak, brilliant start to the season and very good transfer market. They have the most difficult group amongst the English teams with Juventus, Sevilla and Mönchengladbach in Group D. These teams are very good with the ball and City's mid field will be tested. The key will be combination of Toure, Silva and DeBruyne. This might just be their year in the Champions league.Manchester United: Drawn in group B with PSV, CSKA and Wolfsburg, they will find it easy to get through, but their aim should be finishing the group on top so as to avoid pulling off ""an Arsenal"". They still need a lot of improvement in their squad to reach later stages of Champions League. Experience of Schwienstiger will be handy, Mata and Herara will have to provide the much needed flair.Arsenal: In Group F with Bayern, Olympiacos and Dinamo Zagreb, very tricky away games which will shape up their campaign. Have to get as many as possible points at home. Ozil needs to step up to his reputation and Ramsey has to start getting more goals. This finally should be their year to reach beyond top 16, but we Gooners said that last year too. :Ptl;dr: All the 4 English teams should reach the top 16 but serious tittle contention is expected largely, only from City.

Pratik-Jha-3,"Here is my list some of the Prophecies, including who its about and where you can find it in the books if you wanna read it.**I will not be telling what they really correspond to, Just to avoid giving away any major spoilers.** 1. Maggie the Frog: Cersei mentions her the show once (out of context) and it is a little confusing but in the books Maggie was a fortune teller in Lannisport who Cersei visited when she was 10 with two of her childhood friends. So Maggie lets Cersei ask her 3 questions but she gave her 4 answers. She predicted whom Cersei would marry, Robert and not Rhaegar.  Maggie Predicted that Cersie would eventually become the queen but a younger and more beautiful queen will come along and take away everything that she held dear. Maggie then went on to predict the number of children she and Robert will have (also the ones they have separately). She specifically predicted the number of living children she will have. So she predicted the total number of Children Cersei and Robert had, i.e, 3+Roberts bastards. (The show may change the total no. of Roberts bastards). It also includes the part about valonqar which Kelsey L. Hayes explains in her answer and it may contain some spoilers.You can find this Prophecy in Book 4, Page 541-542.2.Azor Ahai: This prophecy comes from Melisandre  and is always used in the same sentence with the LightBringer,  though Azor and LightBringer are two separate prophecies. Azor is like the promised chosen one, the one who is destined to lead the army of Lord of light against the White Walkers and the great others. The text of the Prophecy literally reads, ""When the red star bleeds and darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt."" Melisandre tells Stannis that he is Azor Ahai as they are in Dragonstone, the place of smoke and salt. Alternatively it could be Daenerys who was literally born in Dragonstone as an infant. Or anyone else.You can find this Prophecy in Book 3, page 289.3.The Dragon has 3 heads: In Daenerys's Visions in the house of the undying she saw her brother Rhaegar with his wife Elia Martel and their new born baby Aegon, whom the Mountain has supposed to be killed. The interesting part of this story is that Maester Aemon says that Rheagar believed that his son was the fulfillment of the Azor Ahai prophecy (the Prince that was promised). In Daenerys's vision Elia asks Rhaegar to play a song, and he says ""this is the prince who was promised and his is a song of ice and fire."" and then he turns around and says ""there must be one more, the dragon has three heads"" .Rheagar was naming his children after Aegon the Conqueror and his two sisters, but he had only two with Elia who were believed to be killed by the Mountain, so he was intending on having one more baby girl.  This doesn't guarantee that Rhaegar's children are the three heads of the dragon and George R. R Martin once said that the three heads of the dragon may or may not be all Targaryens. (But he could just be messing around with our imaginations by saying something like this). Meaning that there could be some characters from other houses in the books/show who do not that they have Targaryen blood. So one thing that should be clear in Game of thrones is that even Highborn people sleep around. There are lot of theories about who can be this character, one of the famous ones is R+L=J. The whole thing about Daenerys's house of the undying visions can be found in Book 2, page 514-516.I personally love the Dragon has three head Prophecy as it really opens up a lot of theory crafting and will take shape the story further in the show and the books.",high,high,high,high,low

Toni Pulis is a very, very defensive minded manager and some thing that really speaks out volumes about him his that he has never been relegated as a  top league manager.So what Pulis brought in Stoke was this flavor of his which was largely big strong players rolling their sleeves up and being physical with the game. He brought players like Odemwingie, Ryan Shawcross, Peter Crouch, Charlie Adams, really tough, tough players.  Obviously, being a Arsenal fan Shawcorss reminds me of the time when he almost ended Aaron Ramsey's career whit a ankle breaking tackle which kept Ramsey away from play for almost an year.

They have a reputation of not giving easy goals to any teams and working their ass off physically. Stoke is also,  generally a very cold place to go to.

Pratik-Jha-3,"Well of-course you can, as many people have mentioned in their answers that fruit or vegetable peel wont kill you. Most of the people do eat peels of fruits and vegetables like Apple, potato, eggplant, etc. But here's a list of fruits/vegetables which have peels of really good nutritious but people dont generally eat it due to bad taste of lack of awarenss toward their benefits.Citrus (Oranges, Lemons, Grapefruits, Limes)The peel of an orange packs in twice as much vitamin C as what's  inside. It also contains higher concentrations of riboflavin, vitamin  B6, calcium, magnesium and potassium. The peel’s flavonoids have  anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. (Citrus fruit also boosts iron absorption.)As nutritious as citrus peels are, you’re unlikely to start  eating oranges whole. The entire peel is bitter and difficult to digest.  Instead, grate the peel using a microplane or another tool and sprinkle  it on top of salads, or in a vinaigrette dressing. Citrus shavings make  a good pairing with ice cream and chocolate as well.CucumbersThe dark green skin contains the majority of a cucumber’s antioxidants,  insoluble fiber and potassium. The cucumber peel also holds most of its  vitamin K. The next time you have a Greek salad, ask the chef not to  peel your cucumbers. KiwiYou've probably been spooning out the green flesh inside for years, but a  kiwi's fuzzy exterior is also edible. In fact, the skin contains more antioxidants and vitamin C than the insides—and double the  fiber. So ditch the spoon, wash the kiwi and eat it like a peach. If you find the fuzz unappetizing,  scrape it off first.MangoResearchers found that  mango skin contains properties similar to resveratrol, which helps burn  fat and inhibits the production of mature fat cells. Mango flesh  extracts were also tested, but did not produce the same results, which  suggests that one needs to eat mango skin in order to get this  beneficial property.A mango's peel also contains larger quantities of carotenoids,  polyphenols, omega-3, omega-6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids than its  flesh. Another study found compounds more heavily concentrated in mango's skin that fight  off cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Mango skin also has quercetin.The skin of a mango can be eaten raw, or cooked along with the  insides. Another way to eat both flesh and skin is to pickle the entire  mango.CarrotsSince the skin of a carrot is the same color as what's directly beneath  it (like a tomato or a red pepper), the peel and its flesh have similar  nutritional properties. However, the highest  concentration of phytonutrients is found in a carrot's skin or  immediately underneath. Just rinse the carrot thoroughly rather than  peeling it. WatermelonAll watermelon contains citrulline,  which has antioxidant properties and converts to arginine, an essential  amino acid that is beneficial to the heart, immune system and  circulatory system. But most of that citrulline is found in the rind.  Eating a rind might sound unappetizing, but it can be  pickled (like a cucumber), or simply sautéed and seasoned. Or throw it  in a blender with the watermelon flesh, and add some lime.OnionsLike apple skin and mango skin, the outside of an onion's skin contains  quercetin. Although that skin is not directly edible, you can draw out  some of those nutrients by adding it to stock.PineapplePineapple contains bromelain, an enzyme that can help reduce inflammation, especially in the nose and sinuses. One study found that a pineapple's core and peel yielded the highest amount of bromelain in the fruit, at 40 percent by weight.The skin and core of a pineapple straight-up would be tough on  your digestive system, so try putting them through a juicer or sauté  them for a few minutes in a pan.BananasA banana's peel contains way more fiber than its flesh, and is likewise richer in potassium.The peel also contains lutein, a powerful antioxidant that plays a  role in maintaining healthy eye function. An amino acid called tryptophan is more  highly concentrated in the peel than the insides. Among other things,  tryptophan is believed to ease depression by increasing the body's  levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter in the brain that affects mood.Although the peel has a bitter taste and tough, ropey consistency  most people aren’t used to, an overripe banana (brown or black) becomes  thinner, sweeter and easier to chew. You can also put the peel (ripe or  overripe) through a juicer with the rest of the banana. Or you can boil  the peel for several minutes to make it softer, or throw it in the  frying pan.  If you want to get really creative, bake a banana peel in  the oven for 20 minutes or so.Sources and other credits:Pineapple ‘waste’ could provide bromelain extract for ingredient useMangoes for diabetes?Mango fruit peel and flesh extracts affect adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 c...",high,high,high,high,low

Pratik-Jha-3,"One thing that one should keep in mind when talking about lyrics is that they always reflect the response by people.  The quality of lyrics in a song is dictated by the business of films.  The song needs to have a lot of commercial value for people to buy it.  After Javed Akhtar and Gulzar, we still have some really good song  writers such as Irshad Kamil, but lyricists have their own pressures to  make a song a hit. It must not be forgotten that the quality of lyrics is also a reflection  of the taste of the young generation, most of whom don't like poetry  anymore (excludes me). Also, songs are 'watched' these days, and not just 'heard' as  was the case earlier. Lyrics get second priority to the video, and the lyricist  writes a song keeping this  in mind. That's why I don't think it is right  to blame the lyricists alone. They are a product of our environment. Moreover the use of both English and Hindi (which is how many of us talk)  in one song has changed the ""depth"" of lyrics. In the past there have been songs with crass lyrics such as 'Sexy sexy  mujhe log bole' or 'Choli ke peeche kya hai'. So, it isn't a new  phenomenon. Thus the phenomenon of Survivorship bias does come into picture, which is rightly explained by Deepak Mehta in his answer. There is a large portion of us who like listening to songs with primitive, naive lyrics. So there must be a good balance between the two. On the brighter side there are movies like ""Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani"" which has songs like 'Badtameez dil' and  'Dilliwali girlfriend,' but also had a song like 'Kabira' and ""Illahi"". But the lack of poetry and ghazals in the modern cinema disheartens me.",high,high,high,high,low

And he is not going to be a big fan of lannister gold.Danerys'  narration goes across most of the opening scenes where she talks about  breaking the wheel i.e., breaking the power game between the houses of  Westeros which is harming the poor commoners the most. This made me think of a link between what she and the high Sparrow is  doing, which I did not notice while reading the books. They have very  different methods but both of them are trying to help the least  fortunateWe have a clip of Stannis Baratheon up at the wall. It looks like he and Melisandre are ready to sacrifice someone for the  Red God.

Here in the bottom right you can see the Arryn banner which tells us  that she is being accompanied by Arryn Bannermen in her journeys along  with LittleFinger.Here's Arya with her coinSince she is a stone room looks like this is a clip from the inside of the house of Black and White (seen in trailer #1)After this we see these masked people fighting with the unsullied, which almost confirms that these men are the Sons of the Harpy, militant organization made my the Slavers/Lords of the cities that Danerys liberated. In the lower clip we see these men rushing into what looks like Daznak's Pit to fight the Unsullied, this also a conformation of them being the Sons of Harpy So Masked men = not good for DanerysFrom  the later clips it feels evident that the masked men have called a war  upon Danerys and Daario Naharis looks determined to clean them up. After  all he is sleeping with the Khaleesi.Then we also see Varys and Tyrion on the roads of Pentos may be, moving towards Meereen where Danerys is right nowLater we see the clip where Tyrion (probably) sees a dragon(Drogon) for the first time. It  would be a great moment specially for the book readers as Tyrion has  spent most of his time in Esos reading about the dragons, and when he  will finally encounter will be a sight to watch. Considering the  fact that Dragons and Tryion Lannister are two of the best selling  points of the show, they could put them on one frame sooner than  expected.(For the book readers: There are major changes in the  adaption of the Tyrion story from the books, and they are leaving out  couple of important characters, probably giving their storyline to some  other character)We can expect one more wedding scene this Season (possibly no one will die in this one) between Tommen and Margery.See how happy Cersie is :P.These people in Black dresses are the faith militants who work on the command of the High Sparrow.It  looks like they are destroying the costly wine barrels and getting rid  of all the debaucherous things to help the poor commoners. So it is  going to be hard times for Cersie.Here's a clip of John Snow leading a force to Hardhome.Looks  like he will be given the job to join the remaining forces of wildlings  and the Stannis' army before winter comes. It wont be very easy as we  some wildling attacking back. This is newly  upjumped Ramsey Bolton with Myranda. If you dont remember who she is,  she is the one with Ramsey in the woods chasing the other girl when they  were hunting humans for sport. She is going to have a bigger role to  play this season and she might be given the fake Arya plot from the  books. Now this is a real big WTF moment for me, because it looks like Sansa is in the Stark Family Crypt underneath Winterfell. (The story differs in the books) She has probably come here to pay respects to her dead family members.Later we can also see Arryn Bannermen (who are accompanying Sansa and little finger) enter what looks like Winterfell.So  this season we could see a lot of action at winterfell, as Boltons are  already there, Sansa & Littlefinger has also reached there, Brienne  and Pod are goning to follow Sansa to Winterfell soon, and Stannis is  also heading towards the Northern Capital. This is where I think the  show can touch the Winds of Winter territory or may be forshadow it.This shot of Melisandre is really intersecting.The  look she has on her face looks like she is taken aback, which could be  somewhere associated with the WhiteWalkers. Anything that makes  Melisandre make that face makes it interesting. And here The High Sparrow saying, ""The gods demand justice"".  This is his way of saying that he is going to start a holy war, not  necessarily against a single person or family, but against corruption as  he sees it in Kingslanding inside the realm.This could also mean bad times for the Homosexuals in Westeros as we can see in the next clip.   This looks like a courtroom with Tommen, Margrey, Cersie sitting and  the High Sparrow standing. The person who is trying to flee away in this  clip is Loras Tyrell (who's probably in trouble for being homosexual).  The person sitting in front of all of them is the male prostitute  Littlefinger appoints in season one to sleep with and keep an eye on the  Loras in season 1.There are may clips like these, which tell us that the Sand Snakes are going to be bad ass fighters and Dorne is going to be a beautiful place to watch out for.And  at the end we see a awesome self explanatory scene where Danerys sees  Drogon flying above the city of Meereen in all his might. To  sum things up season 5 looks very promising with a lot of new  characters & locations. It surely would feature bigger dragons and  more white walkers because ""winter is coming"".This  was my first attempt at something like this so please comment.  (Criticism is highly appreciated) Please comment if you think i have  missed on anything, use spoiler tags if u are commenting with a  potential spoiler. I would be doing reviews of every episode as soon as possible, so follow the blog to see my insight on each episode.Just to mess with your heads:This could be a potential spoilerCheck out the blog for upcoming reviews and Game of thrones insightsGameof thrrones",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"Here are some blunders I found due to small, trivial mistakesPanasonic’s “Woody”The Japanese company wanted to break into the highly-competitive  consumer PC market and selected the popular cartoon character Woody  Woodpecker as the brand mascot of its new machine. To create a “theme,”  they named the device itself “The Woody,” its touch screen feature  “Touch Woody” … and its automatic web browsing feature “The Internet  Pecker”. The company should have definitely checked the slang  dictionary.Ford PintoThings did not go well for Ford when they introduced their Pinto model  in Brazil. After watching sales go nowhere, the company learned that  “Pinto” in Brazilian slang means “tiny male genitals“. Ford changed the  name to “Corcel” which means “horse” and things got much better.Gerber’s BabyWhen Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same  packaging as they did in the US, with the beautiful Caucasian baby on  the label. Later, they learned that in Africa companies routinely put  pictures of the ingredients on the label, since many people can’t read.Parker Pen PregnanciesWhen Parker Pen marketed a ballpoint pen in Mexico, the advertisements  were supposed to say: “It won’t leak in your pocket and embarrass you”.  However, the company mistakenly thought the Spanish word “embarazar”  meant embarrass. Rather than the meaning they intended to convey, the  advertisements actually read “It won’t leak in your pocket and make you  pregnant”.Pepsi’s China SloganWhen Pepsi expanded their market to China, they launched with the  slogan, “Pepsi brings you back to life”. What they didn’t realise is  that the phrase translated to “Pepsi brings your ancestors back from the  grave.” At least the Cola-Cola executives had a good laugh. Another  slogan that didn’t translate so well was when Scandinavian vacuum  manufacturer Electrolux used the slogan “Nothing sucks like an  Electrolux” in an American campaign.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"Her is a list of rarest of rare languages all over the world.Chamicuro:  Throughout the world, there are 8 people that speak Chamicuro, according  to a 2008 study. The language is mostly spoken in Peru and is today  considered to be critically endangered, as most of the people who do  speak it are older. There are no children who speak Chamicuro because  the region has adapted to speaking Spanish. However, those who spoke the  language were able to develop a dictionary of their terms. If you ever  want to know how to say a few animals in Chamicuro, use these: kawali (horse,) polyo (chicken,) pato (duck,)  katujkana (monkey,) ma’nali (dog,) mishi (cat,) waka (cow.)Dumi (wiki: Dumi language)  Dumi, a language of Nepal is usually spoken in regions near the Tap and  Rava rivers. It is also spoken the mountains of Khotang District,  located in eastern Nepal. It is a Kiranti languages, meaning that it is  part of the Tibeto-Burman language family. With only 8 people speaking  it in 2007, the language is considered to be critically endangered.  Information about the Dumi language has been collected overtime, and  there is a dictionary available. There are also many books written about  the language’s grammar and syntax.Ongota: n 2008, the Ongota language was said to still be declining. Only 6  native speakers know and use the language, all of them are elderly. This  makes the language critically endangered. However, unlike most  languages that are disappearing, there is actually a professor at Addis  Ababa University in Ethiopia that studies Ongota. He’s concluded that  the language follows a structure of subject, object, and verb. Ongota is  said to be a Afro-Asiatic language that is spoken in Ethiopia on the west bank of the Weito River in a tiny village.Liki/Moar (wiki: Liki language) Liki is a critically endangered language that is spoken in Islands  off of the north coast of Sarmi, Jayapura Kabupaten, and Sarmi  Kecamatan, all of which are islands near Indonesia. In 2007, a study showed that only 5 people speak the  language. In the past, the language was spoken by all local church  officials who lived in the region. The language doesn’t have just one  origin, as it is said to be Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian,  Central-Eastern, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Western Oceanic,  North New Guinea, Sarmi-Jayapura Bay, and Sarmi. Tanema (Tanima, Tetawo): In the Solomon Islands, the Tanema language was once used in places  such as Vanikolo Island (image), Temotu Province and in an Emua village. Today,  the language is only spoken by 4 people, according to a 2008 conducted  study. This makes the language critically endangered.  Tanema is Austronesian as well as Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern,  and Oceanic. Many of those who once spoke Tanema have adapted and have  started to speak either Pijin or Teanu, both of which are very popular  languages within the region. Want to learn verbs in Tanema? Try: wekini  (to turn), laro (to swim), la vamora (to work), and la munana (to lie  down.)Njerep (wiki: Njerep language) : Njerep is a Bantoid language that is spoken in Nigeria. The language  was once spoken in Cameroon but isn’t any longer. It is now most  commonly spoken near the Mambila. Today, the language has been replaced  by different Mambila dialects such as Ba and Mvop. There are only 4  people who still speak Njerep according to a study conducted in 2007,  making the language critically endangered. Those who do speak the  language are elderly, so in a few centuries the language will more than likely be extinct.Chemehuevi (wiki: Chemehuevi): Chemehuevi, a Uto-Aztecan, Northern Uto-Aztecan, Numic, Southern  language is mainly spoke in states in the Midwest as well as on the  western coast. You may hear the language spoken in Ute, Colorado,  Southern Paiute, Utah, northern Arizona, southern parts of Nevada, and  in Colorado River, California. While the Chemehuevi tribe does still  exist and is thriving, the amount of people who speak the language  fluent is not. A 2007 study showed that only 3 people fully speak the  language, all of them adults. If you ever want to talk about natural  things in Chemehuevi, try words such as kaiv (mountain), hucip (ocean),  mahav (tree), and tittvip (ground/soil).Lemerig (wiki: Lemerig language): Spoken in Vanuatu, an island located in the southern part of the Pacific Ocean about 1,000 miles east of northern Australia. More specifically, this language is spoken in Vanua Lava Island.  The language only has two people left who can speak it fluently,  according to a 2008 study, making it another nearly extinct language on  the list. Lemerig consists of at least four different dialects, all of  which are probably extinct.Kaixana: Kaixana is one of the many critically endangered languages that exist  today. The language was once spoken in a village near the banks of the  Japura River, located in Brazil. Over time, Portuguese settlers took  over the area. At one point, nearly 200 people spoke the language. But, a  2006 study showed that only one person still speaks Kaixana, making it  critically endangered.Taushiro (wiki: Taushiro language) : Taushiro, a language of native Peru, is spoken in the region of the  Tigre River, Aucayacu River, which is a tributary of the Ahuaruna River.  It is known as a language isolate, which means it has no demonstrable relationship with any other  language. Those who spoke the language usually only counted up to ten,  using their fingers. For instance, to say “one” in Taushiro, you’d say  washikanto. To say a number above 10, you’d say “ashintu” and point to a  toe on your foot. In 2008, a study conducted on the Taushiro language  concluded that only one person speaks the language fluently. The  language has since been listed as nearly extinct.Source and Credits: Top 10 Lists : Toptenz.net",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"Lets begin by eliminating clubs. Bony is a very physically strong player (One of the highest in terms of strength in FIFA15). So its unlikely to see him leaving out of England where his strengths will be largely appreciated.He is payed around 50k per week now in Swansea, and is expected to be paid around 150k in the next club he goes to with transfer fee of surely more than 25m. These stats surely suggest a big premier league team, which leaves us to 6-7 clubs.ManUnited have 3 solid forwards and bringing Bony will be a waste of money, they'll spend more on defence.Liverpool can and should make a solid bid for Bony, but one will have to look at the resources they have to spend. But at the moment they are not much of a crossing team and they dont have the typical crossing wingers to aid Bony.Arsenal's attack is a lot about intricate play, and coming of a new big name will hamper that so I don't see him going to Emirates. And like United they should spend on defense at the moment.Spurs are the team in form now and they do have genuine goal scorers now in Kane, Chadli and Erikson. They will not be looking to spend that much money.Chelsea, the complete team at the moment, they surely dont need first team players.Manchester City, The club who had 4 strikers in the beginning of season and now almost zero. For me Bony goes to Manchester CityThey have the money to buy himThey have players who can cross like Navas, Kolarov, Nasri to give aerial balls to Bony.Bony has a briliant holdup play, which will bring into pictur players like Silva and Lampard.Aguero and Navas's running behind the defense will take of Bony's inability to do so on a regular basis.Bony can play in the champions league this season. which he would adore.The only thing hampering this move can be financial fair play rules that I will update about soon.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"Short answer: Yes. Baseball is a somewhat originated from an early form of cricket called ""Rounders"".Long Answer: The origin of Cricket is from the elites of Britain. Where as the Baseball was developed by the English immigrants in the United States.Up the coast in Boston, cricket was  played by English immigrants, notably those who considered themselves as gentry. But Boston had begun quite early on to acquire both a plebeian and an Irish flavor. The game of rounders,  an earlier form of cricket which seems to have been favored by the  Irish, as well as by English children in the 16th century, became the  game of choice among the youth. The Boston cricketers of the time encouraged ""Rounders"" as a secondary  diversion, and even allowed it to be played in their cricket fields by  those who preferred an alternative to the more formal sport of cricket. So ""early baseball"", i.e. "" US Rounders"", grew up in the USA under cricket's benign umbrella. It stayed that way for about the first hundred years of its existence.So what was this ""rounders"" liken the 1750s, US Rounders involved only two bases, probably because cricket (of that time and later) used a two-base system as well. The pitcher was known then as the 'feeder,' the batter was called the 'striker,' and the fielders were referred to as the 'scouts.' Basically, the 'feeder' threw a slow, underhand pitch from one base to the 'striker' at the other, exactly where he was asked to deliver it. (If the 'feeder' failed to satisfy the  'striker's' requests, the 'striker' could demand that the 'feeder' be  replaced!) The 'striker' would hit the ball as far as he could, and this  would enable him to run back and forth between his original position  and the other stake, each successful run scoring a point. The scouts or the feeder would field the ball, and try to hit the striker with the ball before he could finish his run and grab the base he was running to (he would be ""safe"" as long as he was holding the post which served as a base). In other words, the MAJOR difference between early Rounders and Cricket in North America was that the bowler/pitcher had no role in getting the batter out...the batter could only be ""run out"" or ""caught"". Getting closer to the modern day BaseballAs more participants joined the game, they set out  more stakes around which the 'striker' had to run before getting back  'home.'...giving the ""scouts"" more targets to throw at !With the changes in rules, came a name change as well. Instead of  ""Rounders"", the game now began to be called ""Townball,"" i.e. an urban sport� unlike cricket, which was then a bucolic and leisure-class activity. The stakes which functioned as bases in ""Townball"" were much closer to each other than the bases in a modern-day baseball diamond---20  yards, as opposed to today's 30 yards. Also, their disposition was ""square"", not diamond-like. The number of bases or stakes were usually four by the early 19th century, although earlier they had varied from two to five. And the pitcher/ feeder stood only 12 yards away from the batter/striker, whose position was between the First and Fourth stakes, about 10 yards away from each.Look at the following diagram, comparing Boston's 1850s Townball ""square"" with the standard cricket pitch. You can easily see, from the diagram, how a Townball ""square"" could develop from cricket net-practice sessions.Just imagine a practice ""pitch"" on the side of a cricket field,  and extend both popping creases 20 yards into the field.  You  will have  a Townball ""square""... and an excellent post-game cricket exercise in  batting and fielding! And that was exactly how early baseball first developed, out of 19th-century US cricket...Not to be outdone by Boston, the New Yorkers renamed their version of rounders 'The New York Game'. They fixed the number of stakes at four bases instead of two wickets.A complete batting order where all persons had batted was termed a  'hand', exactly as in early cricket, but batting would rotate between  the opposite sides on every 'out'. A complete trip around the  bases was called an 'ace.' For the New York Game, the winner was the  first team to score 21 aces, i.e. bring 21 runners ""home"".As the New York Game became established, in 1845 a young surveyor by the name of Alexander Cartwright designed the first baseball diamond,  departing from Boston's ""Town Square"" design. A year later in Hoboken,  NJ, 'The New York Game' was played on a field using Cartwright's  dimensions. The contest featured the New York Nine vs. the Knickerbocker Club. Each club had nine players, apparently for no better reason than  that New York insisted on that number....and in those days, what New  York wanted, New York got.And then baseball got the attention. The arrival of the Civil War helped spread the popularity of the ' New York Game.'  Many  soldiers from the Northeast were seen carrying their equipment while on  duty. After the Civil War, the game became a popular activity, as every  hamlet, village, town, and settlement formed a team. A challenge match between teams from nearby communities was often the setting for a local holiday. As interest in baseball rose, changes were made to ensure the game's continued popularity. For instance, by the early 1800s a round bat was used instead of a flat cricket  bat. Modern cricket bats are expensive and individualized to suit the  tastes of different batters, while baseball bats can be used by just  about anybody who wants to play. All players (including the catcher)  started using padded mitts and protective gear when necessary. More importantly, the rules were also changed to give back the 'feeder' or 'pitcher' more of a role in getting batters out. First, they were allowed to pitch as they wished, not how the striker wanted him to (as in rounders). Then, the batter was restricted to three ""strikes"" (i.e. ""misses"") on accurate pitches, but earned a free base run after four inaccurately thrown pitches (the ""four balls"" rule)...meaning, a batter  was on base for no more than 5 to 10 pitches every time he came in to  bat. Scoring hits were soon restricted to the spaces between the bases facing the batter. Another change: Previously, the batting side would  change on every ""out"", but both sides would keep batting until 21  runners had been brought safely ""home"". Now, the team bringing more runners ""home"" for a given number of ""outs"" was allowed to claim victory.Finally, allowing each inning to consist of three ""outs""  effectively replaced the old ""hands"" into three batting forays per  side... and, by alternating these new ""innings"", each team got the  chance to match or surpass the others score throughout the course of  the game. This increased the suspense of winning or losing, always an  important factor in American sport.But, after 1850, the two games drifted apart... and each assumed its own character and identity.Cricket became a longer and more leisurely game as batters (batsmen)  began to dominate the sport, and wanted more time to display their  individual skills.Baseball, on the other hand, became shorter and more abbreviated....pitchers assumed an active rather than passive role, then came to dominate the sport; baseball  batters were allowed fewer and fewer options, could spend less time at  bat, and the rules were changed to favor shorter games.By the 1900s, cricket and baseball were looking far more different from each other than in baseball's earlier years. And by that time, it had become an issue of ""cricket OR baseball"" in the USA...and everyone knows what happened.

Pratik-Jha-3,"I will talk about my state BiharFirst of all I would like to tell everyone that every Bihari is NOT from Patna, and that is not the only town/city in Bihar.Though I haven't ever lived in Bihar as my dad gets transferred to different places in the country frequently. But I do visit my home town every year during vacations for weeks, which is near Bhagalpur second biggest town in Bihar.First I will put forward some facts.1.The name ""Bihar"" is a corrupt form of ""Vihara""  which means Buddhist Monastery. Bodh Gaya, near Gaya in Bihar, is a  Buddhist centre of pilgrim. It contains the famous ancient temple near  the Bodhi Tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment. - See more at: Important facts About Bihara.  It was here that Prince Gautam attained enlightenment, became the  Buddha- at the present Bodh Gaya- a town in central Bihar; and the great  religion of buddhism was born.b.Lord Mahavira,  the founder of another great religion, Jainism, was born and attained  nirvana (death). That site is located at the present town of pawapuri,  some miles to the south east of Patna, the Capital of Bihar.c.The tenth and last Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind Singh was born and attained the sainthood of sikhism, that is became a Guru. A  lovely and majestic Gurudwara (a temple for Sikhs) built to commemorate  his memory - the harmandir- is located in eastern Patna. Known  reverentially as the Patna Sahib, it is one of the five holiest places  of worship (Takhat) for Sikhs.d.Sita,  the consort of Lord Rama, was a princess of Bihar. She was the daughter  of King Janak of Videha. The present districts of Muzaffarpur,  Sitamarhi, Samastipur, Madhubani, and Darbhanga, in north-central Bihar,  mark this ancient kingdom. The present small township of Sitamarhi is  located here. According to legend, the birthplace of Sita is Punaura,  located on the west-side of Sitamarhi, the headquarters of the district.  Janakpur, the capital of King Janak, and the place where Lord Rama and  Sita were married, lies just across the border in Nepal.So, most of the Indian religions can track back there history to Bihar some way or the other.2. Lets talk about the education.     History of education in Bihar can be traced back to Nalanda University, one of the oldest in the world. At  Nalanda, the world's first seat of higher learning, an university, was  established during the Gupta period. It continued as a seat of learning  till the middle ages, when the invaders burned it down. It  attracted scholars from all over world. The ruins are a protected  monument and a popular tourist spot.Even still education in Bihar is considered to be one of the best, with the Bihar Board considered to be one of the most difficult to score in.3.Economy:   The economy of Bihar  is largely service oriented, but it also has a significant agricultural  base. The state also has a small industrial sector. As of 2011,  agriculture accounts for 22%, industry 5% and service 73% of the economy  of the state. In Terms of GDP, it is ranked 14th in india.     Bihar has achieved highest growth rate in india for three year in row 2010-2013, 15 % for year 2012-13. It has slided down owing to political instability in bihar now.4. Bihar Gave the First President to our nation. So the first highest citizen of India was a Bihari and very important for lichi lovers like meBihar accounts for 71% of production Lichi in India. Now some other information to be shared1. All the Biharis do not speak with ""that""  accent and even if they have, you can't judge some one's knowledge by their accent, can you?.andTrust me when I say this most of the Biharis i have met can say that their English is impeccable. True that there is a section of Biharis who don't have proper education and lack proper language proficiency, but which place doesn't have these problems. Now coming to biggest reason I wanted to give this answer:You can hear almost every second guy saying that these Biharis do nothing but prepare for competitive exams like IAS, IPS, IIT-JEE etc.But no one i think has ever tried to look a for reason.I have one to offer.The major reason most Biharis try to crack competitive exams is that  It is their best bet.If a guy in (say) Gujrat wants to have a peaceful earning life, he can start a business, considering the opportunities they will have in a state like Gujrat and also considering the fact his parents will be highly supportive of it. Business is his ""best bet""People from Panjab, Haryana, Western UP, live on highly fertile lands and business based on agriculture is their ""best bet"".But Bihar as a state is not blessed with a very fertile land, or large amount of minerals, neither it has developed till now as a manufacturing center. So the young aspirants there look for the best possible opportunities for returns and that is giving competitive exams.This is my reason why so many Biharis give competitive exams and the other reason can be that they generally ace them :P.Please do comment if you want say something in general about Biharis, we are open to criticism, we kind off have to be open to them.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"It should not come as a shock when I say that Juventus has the best defense amongst the semifinalists of the Champions League. There were many memes and jokes on Juventus when they reached the semifinals which gave a feel of that they are way behind the other three which is not the case. Juventus has a very good team with  good blend of youth and experience which gives them are pretty good chance to get hold of the trophy. For the finals:Of course Barcelona,  on paper and given the form they are in, would look like big favourites. But with the type of game they play, and with Juventus  staying deep, Barça might get annoyed after a while if things aren’t  going their way. There are a lot of questions with this match. People  suggest the betting is done and it’s Barça’s trophy, but one should be careful.  Italian teams always know how to get a result. Anything is possible in  Berlin.Its pretty sure Juve won’t give Barca space. Juve will not play an open game but  will know that there will be periods in the match, and opportunities,  where they can attack themselves and play high up the pitch. Their best opportunities will come from set-pieces,  particularly as they dont seem being particularly strong on the  counterattack. But they can hurt Barcelona, even if their first task is  to shut them out.  And ofcourse Barca has their weaknesses too Of course they have weaknesses. Most obviously in terms of their defense: remember Bayern Munich scored three goals in the second leg, so  they’re clearly vulnerable. And their biggest strength can also become a  weakness. Those three forwards are all superstars. ""They are a little  bit like divas sometimes"" (Quoting Michael Ballack) when you see them: they don’t like to defend.  So it will be interesting to see how Juventus can create unhappiness in  their game. These kind of players like to have the ball, they want to  play, they want to enjoy movements, to pass the ball around. If Juve  makes sure that can’t happen, as the game goes on they’ll become more  and more frustrated and they can lose their discipline. That’s the key.  That’s the time where Juventus must take over because an Italian team  never loses discipline. Their players live for and thrive off this  discipline.This fragile defensive discipline of Barcelona can be exploited by Juve, esp during set pieces with the prowess of Pirlo. They should play Tevez a little deeper to give weight to their midfield so that they are completely outplayed in the midfield by the catalans. Not many thought that Juve could defeat Real Madrid in the Semis, but they did, because that's what Italians do. The Old Lady always has some some cards up her sleeves.

Pratik-Jha-3,"Yes, Specially in the Indian Subcontinent,Cricket these days have become very batsman friendly, the dead pitches, the great quality of bats add to the misery of the bowlers.There is no denying that cricket is taking a turn for bad. There is something else I would like to address here.I cannot understand why do people/authorities believe that only high scoring matches can be entertaining and will be best for business.""Its beautiful to see balls moving/spinning one way or the other. 2-3 close-in fielders, Bowlers appealing for everything that hits the batsman's body. And then, when the batsman hits a perfectly timed cover drive or straight drive, Its priceless. I think it is more satisfactory for batsman too.(even in ODI)""And if you look at it like this how many matches when the first batting team scores 350+ went on to be a close competition? A very few.  The epic South-African run-chase was an very very rare event.Most of the time when 1st batting team scores a mammoth total, we tend to assume the result and lose interest in the match and switch off our Tv sets.What people need to understand is that a sport is most appreciated when it is competitive. So a single team/Player scoring enormous amounts of runs may not be best for business.P.S: one of my favorite all time ODI is the one during 2011 world cup when England defended a small total of 170 odd against South-Africa.

Pratik-Jha-3,"It will finally come down to Ronaldo vs Neuer; Club vs CountryWhy?, lets break down the last season of these three incredible gemsLionel Messi:Messi had one of the most rocky season of late. He fell short in the La Liga and Copa del Rey right at the last hurdle in 2013-14. As if that weren’t enough, he also missed the chance to get his hands on  the World Cup trophy, losing to the overall superior German team at the  end of extra time.Messi did win the Guldbollen for the Best Player of the World Cup, silencing his critics who thought that he cannot bring his Barcelona best to the international side. Messi had a injury before the turn of the year, but he came back strongly to score 20 goals in the later half of the season, which put him ahead of Deigo Costa in terms of scoring La Liga goals.Messi almost single-handedly took Argentina to the final of the world cup with support coming from only Mascherano and DiMaria mostly. Under Luis Enrique in the new season, Messi has taken up a little deeper role,  one that he has always preferred as it gives him the space and time that  lets him run at defenders and create chances, doing what he does best.  In 18 matches, Messi has 17 goals and 9 assists for Barcelona this  season, maintaining his status as their biggest creative and attacking  threat.PrognosisChances for Messi to win the Ballon d'Or are slim. Messi would have significantly strengthen his claim on the award. The fact that Barcelona had a trophy less season really puts a dent in Messi and his fan's ambitions.Manuel Neuer:There are only few lucky gifted footballers who can revolutionize and pioneer a playing positon. Johan Cryuff did for the ""false 9"", Franz Beckenbauer did it for the libero or the attacking sweeper position, Makalele did for the holding  midfielder position and surely put Neuer in this list for introducing us to the sweeper keeper.Neuer was one of the most instrumental players for the most succesful international team of the year and the fact that he did as a goalkeeper really speaks volume for his talent. He comes out on the top in terms of making all the saves that a keeper  should, making some that only a few would and even going to make some  that none of his fellow keepers would. At 6’4”, he is an intimidating  presence in one-on-one situations and penalties. His great anticipatory  instincts and footballing brain allow him to smother most one-on-one  situations with the minimum of fuss. Xabi Alonso opines that  Neuer is the best goalkeeper he has ever trained with. Considering that  he has trained with the likes of Valdes, Reina, Casillas, De Gea and  Dudek among others, it’s a great compliment indeed. theScorePrognosisI absolutely want him to win the Ballon d'Or and the fact that Micheal Platini said that he thinks a world cup winner should win the award really lightens me up. With his club he did get his hands on a Domestic double, which is to be proud of. But obviously what really gives him the edge is the world cup. It would be great to see a goalkeeper to win the footballer of the year award. Neuer has won almost every thing season, only if Bayern would have won the Champions League it would have taken him leagues ahead.Cristiano RonaldoTo quote Carlo  Ancelotti, Cristiano Ronaldo is the the runaway favorite for the award.  2014 has been a marquee year of his already well-decorated career, and  the crowning glory of his time at Madrid, when he finally broke the  Champions League scoring record and led Real Madrid to the long-awaited  Decima. Despite missing a few games due to injury and suspension,  Cristiano ended last season with 51 goals in 47 games. The cherry on  top for him was scoring the last goal of the Champions League final at  the Estadio da Luz in front of thousands of Portuguese people, banishing  memories of defeat at the same venue against Greece 10 years ago.Ronaldo has already won UEFA Best Player of The Year for last season, he also bagged La Liga’s  Best Player, Best Striker and Best Goal awards for his scintillating  efforts last season. What really troubles me for Ronaldo's claim is that not only did Portugal performed poorly in the world cup, Ronaldo's performance in particular was really disheartening. Drawn with Germany, Ghana and the US in the group stages, it wasn't a difficult group to be able to grab the second spot.PrognosisRonaldo would have run away with this award if Madrid would have won the La Liga. Portugal's abysmal performance on the grandest of stages could really prove to be Ronaldo's Achilles' heel at this moment.The Debate can finally come down to Club vs country as Ronaldo did win the biggest prize there is to win with a club and Neuer did that in International colors. What could give Ronaldo the final push is the panache with which he has played over the year and the fact that he is the face of football. Though I would be thrilled if finally the keeper wins it and it would be right foot towards FIFA's approach to international football.",high,high,high,high,low
Pratik-Jha-3,"Virat Kohli is going to captain India in the First test against Australia, Dhoni being ruled out due to injuries. It will be a welcome change surely for Kohli and will also provide new things to Indian Cricket team.To understand Kohli's captaincy the first thing that one should decipher is that Kohli and Dhoni are very different players and they will surely turn out to be very different captain. So the first thing Kohli brings is a fresh change, a new approach.Since Kohli will soon (hopefully) be taking captaincy over from Dhoni their comparisons will surely be an integral part of Kohli's captaincy career. How different Kohli and Dhoni are can be tracked back to the start of their careers.Dhoni is rumored to be originally a goal-keeper at football and he later began playing cricket. I can picture Dhoni as not being the star in early days of his career. He was a late bloomer.  As we know Dhoni is from a small city called Ranchi, which surely didn't offer Dhoni a big stage very early in his career. The coolness in thinking, and always choosing the safe option can be traits that Dhoni learnt from not having a very illustrious teenage and early 20s.Contrary to that Kholi would have been a star kid from the childhood. I can picture him being the captain at school level, neighborhood level. Some one who had received attention from early parts of his career. A lot of this early attention can be linked to his stylish batting style contrary to Dhoni. Kohli was born in Delhi, which is one the biggest cities in India and would have surely provided a considerable amount of audience and fame to Kohli in his teenage. He is someone who won the under-19 worldcup, and then quickly found a solid spot in the team. This gives rise to the panache and swagger Kohli caries. Kohli is also very outspoken (which we have all noticed :P) when compared to Dhoni. So the best thing in Kohli's captaincy will infold in the coming years, but what one can expect is Dominant, outspoken, proactive, risk-taking captain. Though it must be acknowledged that working under/with Dhoni would have given air to the calm side to Kohli, something any captain must have. That would surely police him when required.So people get ready people for some MCs, BCs on pitch :P, some risky declarations, some shirt waving, and a large amount of Viavacity as Kohli's era is soon dawning.",high,high,high,high,low
Rishal-Raj,"1. Atheists can never claim that Science has its own explanation of anything because a lot of them are not actually scientists or have the immense understanding of science required to make scientific claims. All Atheists ever do is say that the one making the claim needs to prove what he/she is saying is true or else we will continue to live assuming that it is not true (the why for this has been explained many times over on the internet and even in other answers to this question, so I will choose to ignore it) and they are also free to do whatever they want in their own Personal lives. Most atheists aren't even really concerned about making people realize that there's no proof for God's existence. What really started this entire Theism vs. Atheism debate is the fact that Theists make extraordinary claims and then formulate laws in accordance with those claims that inhibit the rights of several people throughout the world. Abortion laws, Gay rights, Discrimination against Women are just a few which have resulted in the Atheists asking the believers to first provide proof of their claims and then encroach upon other people's rights. It is solely because the lives of atheists are encroached upon that they don't want to live and let live anymore.Still, it ends at just that, asking for proof of their claims. Atheists never give counter claims regarding anything. Now, there may be Atheists who are scientists or philosophers or anthropologists who may talk about their respective fields of expertise but atheists in general do not/can not talk about such claims.2. As far as the scientific claim regarding the creation of the Universe is concerned, not even people of the sciences claim to know the answer. Science simply recognizes that fact that we don't know instead of creating images and idols to fill a gap in our knowledge. Scientists are continuously trying to find the answer by forming theories based on the data that we are collecting. Right now, not even scientists let alone atheists make any scientific claim about the origin of the universe.My $0.02P.S. - The Big Bang is never claimed by the scientists as the origin of the Universe or any semantically similar statement. What is claimed is the fact that Big Bang is like a barrier and there may have been something before the Big Bang but none of that affects the time after Big Bang and there is sufficient proof to believe this. So, we can treat it as Time Zero and choose to focus only on the after BB time until we can unravel its mysteries and then divert our energies to finding what was before.P.P.S. - More on proofs and their certainty in this answer of mine if anybody is interested Rishal Raj's answer to Atheism: Are atheists 100% sure that there is no god or deep down they are more of agnostics?",high,high,low,high,low
Rishal-Raj,"So, I know that popularity might affect the opinion of many people on this. Let's just look at the facts and judge.1. Sauron was trained under Morgoth. Now, Morgoth is a Valar which is the highest beings in the world if you don't count Illuvatar the creator. Also, Morgoth was the strongest of them all and Sauron was one of his highest lieutenants.Voldemort on the other hand was trained at Hogwarts. Even considering that he was trained by the best in the world, it just doesn't compare to Sauron's training.2. Sauron himself was a Maiar and one of the most powerful (for those who believe that he was definitely more powerful that Gandalf, we may have that discussion elsewhere) which is the second tier of beings after the Valar which makes him very powerful of his own accord. Definitely more powerful than humans and elves and other such lesser beings.Voldemort on the other hand, a mere human. Probably one of the best and most powerful but still only a human, outranked and outclassed.3. As far as the armies are concerned, Sauron had huge armies of orcs, wargs, haradrim, corsairs. He had the Nazgul, the Witch King of Angmar (the greatest sorcerer of his time), Saruman under his grip and several others. Voldemort had a few death eaters. Mighty as they were they couldn't really stand against the might of Barad dur. Just look at the size of the army that attacks Gondor or even Helm's Deep.4. Taking into account the Horcruxes, the scenario doesn't change much because Sauron is the master manipulator. He convinced the King of Men to attack Aman after being made councilor (considering he should have been in prison). He could probably convince Voldemort to give up the locations of the Horcruxes. Also, he has the huge army mentioned above to do the searching for him. Destroying the Horcruxes is then child's play as he's a Maiar and definitely has more magic than a Basilisk fang.5. There are a lot of people who think that Voldemort might have the upper hand in single combat because he has a wand and magic. Remember Caradhras anyone? The Witch King of Angmar was taught a lot of magic by Sauron. He was thought to be a Necromancer. He was a freaking Maiar! Pretty sure that trumps any magic spells that Voldemort can throw at him even Avada Kedavra. 6. If Voldemort gets the ring. That would probably be more fatal for him instead of Sauron. He would just be corrupted by it as the ring works more effectively on the powerful and power hungry. He would just fall to Sauron's hold, would never be able to destroy the ring and ensure Sauron's victory.7. Mind Battles. Voldemort is skilled in Occlumency and Legilimency but he cannot penetrate into Snape who is probably not the most powerful. Sauron on the other hand is only bested by Gandalf (who is extremely exhausted afterwards) and Arargon (because Sauron saw Islidur). Sauron would easily break Voldemort's mind if Voldemort ever makes the mistake of entering into mind battles.So in the end, as mighty as Voldemort might have been, its like the clash of a super massive planet with a super massive black hole. My $0.02P.S. - Personally speaking, I think the Witch King of Angmar could take on Voldy and easily defeat him.P.P.S. - Anybody who thinks Voldemort is probably stronger than Gandalf, please just read up on the LOTR lore.",high,high,low,high,low
Rishal-Raj,"There are two kinds of proofs that exist in the world of academia and discussion. One is the proof in mathematics. Mathematics is built upon a set of axioms, rules that have been and are observed to always be true. These rules are assumed to be true and all mathematical proofs are built upon these axioms. So proof in the absolute sense i.e. 100% proof is possible in mathematics because it is based on these absolute axioms. Now these axioms are also subject to change (like any other field of science) but because they are based on a long period of observations and are formulated at a very basic level, they generally do not change. Hence the notion of proofs in mathematics is related to a 100% surety.In any field of discussion apart from mathematics, the term 'proof' is used in a very different sense. When for example, we formulate laws in science (like the Law of Gravity or the Theory of Evolution), then they are not facts or proven to be 100% true ever. That is just not how science is.The fossils that are found or earth's force that we ALL feel are shown very often to be proofs of these theories. What this actually means is that these are some naturally occurring phenomenon for which these theories are the BEST explanation we have. These explanations are revised from time to time if we find new evidence (like the black swan example given by Barry Hampe). This revision allows for us to always have the best possible explanation for anything.So, by this definition of proof, yes, most atheists are sure even deep down that they do not believe in any god (not that they believe there ARE NO GODS but this is a different discussion altogether). Now talking about me (and most atheists I know on Quora or otherwise), atheists would be willing to revise their viewpoint any day if such proof was presented to make the god hypothesis the best explanation but until then we're sure deep down or otherwise.Now, Theism or Atheism is only concerned with whether one has a belief in god or one does not believe in god.Agnosticism on the other hand deals with whether the truth values of certain claims can ever be known. It has absolutely nothing to do with Theism or Atheism. It is not as some claim the middle ground between the two, its is but a different axis of discussion altogether. I for example can say that we can never know whether chicken came first or the egg and I would still be an agnostic without even talking about (a)theism.Now, one can be at any position on one of the axes and that is in no way related to the other.So, one can be either a theist or an atheist and that says nothing about them being agnostic My $0.02",high,high,low,high,low
Rishal-Raj,"Thanks for the A2A.I'm going to take the more popular and widespread definition of God. God is a supreme being who created the world and everybody in it, runs it, has the policy of divine intervention and retribution and a purpose.1. In any field of logical reasoning, the onus always lies with the person making claims or giving hypothesis. Since you cannot prove that I don't have invisible arms that help me do work. Negatives of a negative statements do not require proof. It is the theist's job to provide proof if God exists ( or maybe God's job).Until such proof is presented by the theist, as rational people we believe that God does not exist.2. Looking at things that point towards the non-existence of God.   i. A god who is all poweful and loving, would not condemn people to hell just           because they were born in different parts of the world ( assuming that only one of       the hugely contrasting religions is true.)   ii. All of the religions in the world have logical fallacies, factual inaccuracies           and phenomenon later explained by science.   iii. Anthropologists and Historians alike have worked together to realize that            socio-cultural influence is a better/simpler explanation for the growth of              religion. Essentially, people needed a God so they made one.Today, the world as we know it has been explained in such detail by non-supernatural means that the only change the answer to this question is going to bring is the mere existence of God without any after effects.

Rishal-Raj,"In reality, the statement made by atheists or by anybody for that matter that, there is no evidence for X, is the simplified version of ""there is no evidence for X yet"". When atheists around the world (or Quora) keep asking for credible, verifiable and objective evidence, that itself is an indication that they believe in the possible existence of such an evidence which has not presented itself to us yet.This claim can be said to be made from ignorance if your definition of ignorance is as widespread as it appears from the question but then almost every claim made in the world is made from ignorance.This is the precise reason why the negative of a statement is not taken up as burden and the burden of proof is on the one making a positive claim. Negative statements by their nature require omniscience to prove. Hence positive claims are assumed to be false until proven to be true.Unicorns don't exist is a claim that if taken up to prove would require omniscience as you need to be aware of all space and time in the universe to conclude this. We take it to be true as there is no evidence for the contrary while keeping open the possibility of revision.Similar is the case with god.My$0.02P.S. - More on proofs in this answer of mine Rishal Raj's answer to Are atheists 100% sure that there is no god or deep down they are more of agnostics? if you are interested.",high,high,low,high,low
Debanjana-Chakraborty,"I expect many of the guys are going to give a straight answer: GIRLS ARE DUMB.Wait!! I see one.I study in IIT Kharagpur where everyone (mainly the male population) rues about the 1:10 ratio (so less girls!!!)When I attended coaching classes for JEE preparation, the ratio of female students to that of male was 1:20!!!You visit ANY coaching institution in India, for every 10 to 15 boys you will find only one girl!!The less number of girls in IITs owe to the fact that still a large portion of the Indian parents don't feel their daughters are worthy of doing engineering from a reputed college or institution here. It has nothing to do with the intelligence quotient of a girl.You will find nearly every parent shouting and screaming at their son if they don't study right from the beginning of their education.How many parents do that with their daughters?Once my mother, while socializing with other parents in a Parents-Teachers Meeting, expressed her concern regarding my future education.One of the parents of another girl replied ""You should focus more on your son.She can study BSc from any college.After all she is so fair, she will get a nice groom.""The moment a daughter is born in India, the parents are more concerned with their marriage than education!!! Maybe that is why most girls end up in some local science, art or commerce college rather than attending a prestigious institution in India. That is a stunt to show WE ARE EDUCATING OUR DAUGHTERS.And yes, the success rate of girls who prepare for JEE cracking JEE is nearly 50%, not so with boys. (PERSONAL OBSERVATION)So, those who think girls are dumb and not fit for cracking JEE or any other entrance exam, you still have time to change your mentality.Maybe you can motivate your daughters to dream big and work accordingly and see whether they deserve to be in a prestigious college or not!!EDIT: 50% is not the actual stats.I am referring to the coaching class I attended, and yes success rate for girls were about 50% !!!Well, guys are so much into the ONE point I made, based on personal experiences, about 50% success ratio of girls...as if its not at all possible!!!The point is the girls are not given a proper scope.If given, they DO perform well.So instead of posting facts published by JEE like only this much percentage out of this many girls cracked JEE, think on why is it so.How many girls do you think got proper guidance out of those lot who sat for the JEE?I found it necessary for those who are posting the stats posted by JEE or other sources regarding the ONLY 2% of girls cracking JEE stuff. Isn't it obvious that the 2% selection is the reason of the less number of girls in IITs? What do you want to actually prove by re-posting that? I am highlighting few things which I think deserve more attention than a mere personal observation which I never realized could hurt so many egos!!

Debanjana-Chakraborty,"This is a recent incident.I boarded a mini bus from Howrah. It was daytime. And FYI, mini buses in Kolkata do not have seat reservations.Few minutes later, a middle-aged man boarded the bus and in a jiffy sat beside me.Please note that quite a few other seats were still empty, even those beside windows.I felt a bit awkward when he chose to seat himself beside me but decided to avoid such apprehensions and maintain a distance from him.Few minutes later that man spread his legs and took as much space of the seat as possible, completely sticking with me, and I realized it was too suffocating for a nearly empty bus.I asked him to maintain a distance, he won't listen.I decided to change my seat,but he wouldn't move a little to allow me out.I looked helplessly at the bus conductor but he was indifferent. I finally gave up and prayed for the bus to reach my destination as fast as it can.But it was not enough.I suddenly felt ticklish, as if someone is tickling me and poking me constantly near my abdomen and was horrified to find out that the man took the opportunity of that forced closeness to carry out such gruesome act-call it eve-teasing or anything.I was so afraid,humiliated and anxious that I shouted at the top of my voice to stop the bus and told the conductor that I wished to depart the bus there itself.I know thousands of women here had to face the same thing-we don't feel safe even in the daylight.Perverts do not spare women even in public transport.Have you ever heard of any woman eve-teasing her male co-passenger in a public bus.When a whole lot of men in India still find it difficult to respect women and consider them humans,they perceive woman's body as soft toy supposed to poked and tickled and pressed,how come one can talk about gender equality?Unless and until the Indian women are assured of complete safety, it is fair to have such seat reservations.If that bus had few seats reserved exclusively for the female gender,that man wouldn't have dared to seat himself beside me and carry out such act.I now avoid the mini buses and board the larger ones with seats reserved for women.

I agree our culture favours male dominance over female but so did other cultures too! India is just taking its time to shove off the patriarchy and completely bring in gender equality, which many other countries have already done.Do you seriously believe what the rapist and the defence lawyers asserted in the documentary is actually what they believe?Do you genuinely feel Nirbhaya was brutally raped and assaulted by the rapists just because they wanted to teach her a lesson? No. They didn't even give a damn about lessons and justice. They were just horny and wanted to have fun by forcing themselves upon her and praising themselves for their so-called masculinity.

Our culture may not allow complete freedom to our women but it certainly does emphasis on respecting  women and safe-guarding them. Rapists all over the world carry same opinions about women being sex objects, it has nothing to do with our culture or mindset.Birds of same feather flock together!!As far as so called restrictions for women like 'You should not go out after 9 p.m' and 'You should not go out with a boy' and so on, are concerned, they are simply illogical and insensible opinions carried out by not only a large portion of Indian males but also the females.After all, every place has its exclusive gossip aunty/girl, who would rant about the character of every girl who believes in freedom from general woman stereotyping.The accused and the defence lawyers should be definitely punished for sending out the wrong message about our culture and allowing the world to mock at us and generalize the Indian male mentality.",mid,high,high,mid,mid
Debanjana-Chakraborty,"I personally prefer books more than their movie adaptations, may be because I love reading more than watching movies.I can't help but spot out even the slightest variations the movies show from what is written in a book be it Harry Potter or Twilight.Though there might be a good chance that the movie adaptation is better than the book itself,we still crave for the movie to be an exact audio-visual replica of the words in the book.There is a huge difference between our approach towards reading academic stuffs and reading novels and fiction works.When we read a textbook prescribed by our institution, we try to understand each and every sentence or simply cram it up, generally before examination.However the scenario is completely different in case of reading novels: That book is actually a script...Your mind is the screen...Your imagination is the director....Each and every line enjoys a visual interpretation in your mind...There is no need for a movie adaptation as the entire movie runs in your mind, guided by your imagination and creativity, each and every line of the book coming alive as you read them.If the story is about a boy with grey colored eyes,short height,plump body,rough messy hair,face full of pimples, some wound marks on right elbow, big fat nose: You actually imagine a boy with each and every characteristics matching; Even the absence of the wound mark on right elbow or pimples in the movie adaptation will force us to conclude that this movie has failed to represent the story.If a scene is described with the protagonists in action and minor role doing some unimportant job;our imagination involve each and every character mentioned in the scene,carrying out their respective jobs just as mentioned.When the movie adaptations fail to show so, we flinch.That is why the Harry described by J.K Rowling rules in our heart more than Daniel in the Warner Bros. HP movie adaptation. We have lived,enjoyed and cherished each and every line penned down by J.K Rowling in the HP series.We have cried when Harry cried, we could feel the pain of Snape for not getting the very much love he craved for from Lily,we became bold and brave with Neville, we felt the wrath Molly felt in midst of her duel with Bellatrix; No, the movies were not the same.

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"Long list of impressive contenders,but there is one more badass,A person who shook an entire kingdom, and destroyed its ruler. Just because the ruler insulted this person.And the name of the person is, CHANAKYA. Also known as Kautilya, Vishnugupta.Born in 350 BCE, studied at Taxila, researched and later became teacher at the same place, he was the most brilliant, diplomat, economist, philosopher and counselor world has ever seen.A brief timeline:Alexander and his unparalleled army was approaching India. Chanakya went to Dhana Nanda, ruler of Magadha, The greatest kingdom of the ancient India, to warn about the upcoming danger and do something about it.Dhana nanda, instead of acknowledging the fact, insulted Chanakya in front of his whole court.Chanakya took pledge to take vengeance upon the nanda family.He scouted the mud and sand of whole Magadha, to find potential ruler, and found Chandragupta Maurya.He took him to Taxila, taught him, trained him with the help of world's best.Then with him, he summed every potential ally he can make, and grasped the opportunity to exploit every mistake Dhana nanda made in past.He defeated the Dhana nanda and thus established the glorious Maurya Empire.Apart from this, his diplomacy with Alexander, scriptures he left behind and the teachings he taught, will always be remembered by this world.",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"These are some very cool Psychological tricks, found on a site..They are pretty good, if you don't know them already.. :){ WITH NEW UPDATES }TVF PITCHERS'S ONE..If you want people to take you seriously, tell them what you say is what your father taught you or attach it with some great personality. People tend to believe fatherly advice inherently.TRUST ME ON THIS ONE..Become a champion in ROCK PAPER SCISSORS by asking them anything right before asking the game, and immediately start rock paper scissor chant, they'll almost defensively throw scissors.USEFUL..When asking someone a question, get them to agree with you by simply nodding your head. The action makes them start to think that what you're saying is true and that they should nod ''yes'' too, since our behaviour is social.NOW I CAN REST IN PEACE..do you have a song struck in your mind, that you'd like to forget? think about the end of the song. According to Zeigarnik effect, your mind tends to think of things left unfinished, so thinking of the end of the song will close the loop and allow you to get the song out of your head.WANT TO INTERROGATE SOMEONE..do you wish your friend would open up? ask him a question, and if he only partially answers the question, keep eye contact and remain silent for a few seconds. They will usually continue talking, maybe a bit irritated, but they will continue to talk..UPDATE:WHEN YOU DON'T WANT YOUR TEACHER TO PICK YOU.. during a class, if teacher ask a question, that you don't know or don't want to answer, do this, start writing something in your notebook, or just pretend to think hard, teacher will automatically assume that you are into subject and won't pick you up. It's tested. Trust me.GOING TO ASK PARENTS FOR MONEY.. whenever you go to ask parents for money, don't ask,instead give them two options, ask them directly,'' will you give me 10 bucks or 20'', although they may ask reason, but they are more likely to give you money.A RELATIONSHIP PROPELLER ONE.. If you are going on a date, with someone you really like, take them to any exciting or adventurous place, like a theme park and ride lots of rides with them. It will cause faster heart beat and increased adrenaline and the other person will think that they had really fun with you,and the excitement is because of you, the roller coaster reason will almost never cross their mind..WANT TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION..when you meet a new person try to notice his/her eyes colour, that person will immediately like you because of the long eye contact, and won't even know that you already did a trick.. :)BIG GRATITUDE FOR SMALL FAVOURS.. if someone do something for you, instead of saying thanks, say thank you or thanks a lot you are great, it feels more personal. And even if you don't mean it, the other person will automatically think that you care.SOURCE: internet and lifeAnd you readers are awesome for the great response, thanks a lot, and I mean it.. :) :)",mid,high,high,low,low

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"Well, you are right.And this not happens only in this sitcom, there are various other movies and series where this happens. Its there in big bang theory, goodness gracious me etc. There is a song recently released called ""Lean on"" by ""Major lazer"" ft. ""DJ Snake"", which may be inappropriate to some one.         But Hinduism ideologies are represented in a positive manner too. And in lot of them. Inception, star wars, matrix. Even one of the Matrix trilogy, featured 'Asto ma Sadgamaya' as their closing song.       What happened in ""friends"" is really offending. Although the original air being a decade old, you can still write to the producers in demand for apology. Although there is no legal action in my knowledge that you can pursue. Similarly as to a Pakistani citizen can't sue ""Gadar"" director for hurting his sentiments.        Its just about what society accepts in a country. We can't make a mockery of any religion in India, let alone Hinduism or Islam, because our society don't approve that. But it's not similar in other countries. Apart from movies based on controversial extremist ideologies like that in the Da Vinci's Code, in uncountable number of movies there is inclusion of 'Jesus' in curses, abuses and mocking conversation, and nobody created a fuss.       Although I am personally not bothered so much about such things but whenever I do, I convince my self by reminding myself the quote, "" Those who are doing something great are always made fun of in the beginning"".So, if someone mocks us, he is just jealous. :)Good luck..",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"I recently came across an article, which suggested to look within the deep lines of the famous epics and not to believe oversimplified meanings.   In similar way,before answering your question, I just want to suggest that, great epics like Ramayana, Mahabharata, Quran or Bible are not as simple as right and wrong. They cannot be limited by the periphery of white and black only. There are meanings within meanings even in a single line of these epics.Now coming to your question,One kidnapped the wife of the man who insulted his sister but did not touch her against her will.""Kidnapped"" Sita,took revenge, by shrewdly sending Ram and Lakshmana away, not fighting like a honorable warrior.Didn't touch Sita against her will because, he was cursed by Kuber's son. Nalkuber, that if he tried to force himself on any women, his all ten heads would fall down and he'll burn in eternal fire. but tested her and left her because people were talking.He didn't test her, he was just taking original Sita back from the fire lord, and returning his essense that was in the form of Sita.He didn't left Sita just because people were talking, but because he was the incarnation who depicted duty. He did what, a good king must do. For a king, his subjects must always come before himself.Moreover these questions were asked by Luv-Kush from Ram, and even he was unable to convince his action, So, I don't count. :)Good Luck.!",mid,high,high,low,low

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"Read this somewhere on quora,INDIAN YOUNG GENERATION DON'T PREPARE TO BE ENGINEER, THEY PREPARE TO BE IITÍAN“IIT is a philosophy, not simply an educational programme,” says Padmashri Dr. M. Anandakrishnan,Former Chairman of IIT Kanpur.There is a really good answer by Mr.Balaji Viswanathan but I do not agree with him completely on this question itself.Being from a middle class family and preparing for JEE, seeing the numbers of student fighting for it in Kota( A hub for JEE preperation in India), and studying in a prestigious institute,to answer your question, I came to following conclusion,                                                                                                                        The main reason, why a majority of students want to study engineering is because, ''mera beta bada ho kar IITian banega'' ( my son will be an IITian one day) psychology of Indian parents and I am saying this in not-blaming-them kind of way. Parents and close ones of every Indian child believes that this kid will change the fate of entire clan ( if need be ) or at least telling anyone that your kid studies in a IIT is a status symbol itself. Being as a upcoming generation its your duty too, but that duty takes tolls.Now, why do we prepare for IIT, simply put, because we want a higher package and respect from others. Coming back to the question, whenever you ask, what are you preparing for, nobody says I am preparing to become a good engineering graduate, but we say,''Sir, I am preparing for IIT''. Its funny, I took this snap right now.. nobody wants to know why but everybody knows how..It's really good to have institution like IIT's in your country, but making your higher education policy around IIT, I don't think is justified. I MEAN WHY ONLY FEW IITs?                                              My teacher told me, that out of 6 lakh applicants for IIT, there are only 1 lakh who are serious, and 50,000 dead serious students, your competition is with these fifty thousand students. But after that I kept thinking, that if, after JEE, only  two thousand or three thousand students are going to get good seats, what about those remaining forty eight thousand dead serious students..Now, I only want to say that, although there are maverick out there too, people who sincerely want to follow their passion, go to research field, go to ISRO or choose to be a teacher or historian by choice. but their percentage is very low.                  So, Our goal is to be enrolled in an IIT, being an engineer is just cherry on the cake.With the current social mindset of India, ''pass everyone-increase the literacy rate'' education system, centralisation of good engineering education around IIT only, increasing competition and decreasing resources,Can you really blame the students or their parents ??",mid,high,high,low,low

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"These are really useful tips, that'll definitely help you..1) Trapped under SnowIf you are stuck under snow where you lose your sense of direction, create a small pocket near your mouth and spit.. This will give you an idea of which way you should be digging to get out of the snow as your saliva would be trickling towards the centre of the earth. Dig in the opposite direction..2) Riding a suspicious taxiIf the driver of the taxi you have hailed is behaving suspiciously, this little trick may just save your life.                   Make a call or pretend to make a call to someone, anyone (doesn't matter).In the course of the conversation, enunciate the digits of the taxi numberplate (could just be the last 4...as long as the driver hears those digits)                    The cabby has no clue what the purpose behind the call is; all he knows is that his taxi is now identifiable by a contact of the passenger. Odds are he won't try any stunts on that ride.3) In the Open oceanIf swimming in the ocean and you get caught in a rip tide (you are being dragged out to sea) start to swim PARALLEL to the shore. The rip is not usually more than 30-40 feet across. If you try to swim against it you will tire quickly and drown.Also, if you are surfing or in big surf and get held under, start to count. Most waves will not hold you down more than 10 seconds. This is good advice to teach the kids when in big waves.

He married beautiful girls, tried to indulge in work, played sports, but at the end of the night, when he was about to sleep, there was always a hollow feeling which made him even more upset. Nothing was working.              One day, he ordered his soldiers to roam  his kingdom in search of a completely happy person to get a piece of clothe from that lucky one so that he may too have his luck.               Following his orders, his men scanned the whole demesne in search of a happy person. But wherever they went, they found disillusionment only.A low status man was unhappy because he desired more status, More status holder was unhappy because his boss made his life miserable, his boss was unhappy because he wanted more money and a rich one was unhappy because he can never become a father.             After a long search, the soldiers came to a cafe to catch their breathe. And suddenly one of them say a performer singing songs. He was sitting on the footpath right across them, he was happily singing a song, and whenever a person passed by him, he raised his cap and accept the offering if any, and kept on singing.             That soldier came to the singer and conversation went like this,SOLDIER: Are you happy?SINGER: Oh! yeah, I am.SOLDIER: You haven't any worries?

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"I believe that every kid in India, because of their different family traditions and cultures, experience a distinct childhood.Same is true for a Brahman kid also. Let's look for reasons..FIRST THINGS FIRST, LETS TALK ABOUT FOOD..:DFirst of all, the initial teachings are that we are STRICTLY VEGETARIAN. Now don't be shy, we all know, that almost 95% of the Brahman love to eat, know matter the cuisine, no matter the place, we are just great foodie, food loving people. And more over that, we are sweet tooth. As soon as guest are gone, the first thing to finish are the sweets, isn't it..? :)BORN WITH SUPERPOWERS, POWER TO BARGAIN :)We want everything for the cheapest price we can get, Some of our parents bargain so well, that it is unbelievable that how much we can persuade the shopkeeper, although this power is continuously reducing with upcoming generations, but still, it's in our blood. ACCHA BETA KISKI TAIYARI KAR RHE HO?? ( SO, SON WHAT ARE YOU PREPARING FOR ?? )For us being an IAS officer is the highest one can achieve and it is the ultimate goal, at least in the eyes of parents, every parent dreams that their kid will be an IAS officer one day, whatever stream may he be in.                                Moreover parents are not like this initially, but Sharma ji ka beta and Dubey ji ki ladki ruins everything.AESTHETIC, SPIRITUAL & MYTHOLOGICAL BACKGROUNDThe first thing taught to a Brahman kid is to sit with his father while he is worshipping. Also little back in time, the kids were taught shlokas, and manuscripts from RAMAYANA to impress the neighbours and relatives.Although now a days, they are replaced by English poems, still in Brahman community you are considered dumb and idiot kid if you don't know which warrior died battling RAVANA in a a airborne fight trying to save SITA maiya.          Also the morning and evening ARTIS with mandatory presence for everyone and going to every major temple in your city atleast once in a month is a regular practice :)Obviously JANEU and KANCHEDAN(piercing of ears, even of boys) are just bonus.At last I just want to say that, I sincerely believe that although being born in a Brahman family, Cast-ism is a malpractice from ancient times which should be dissolved. Because I sincerely believe that, it's the deed that should define a person and not his cast",mid,high,high,low,low

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"WELL THERE IS AN INTERESTING NOTION:If Lord Ram was almighty,then Lord Lakshmana himself was the incarnation of  SHESHNAAG, the king of serpents. How was he poisoned by the NAGPASH (a venomous ''serpent'' arms) by INDRAJEET in the first place.??because as joker deciphered,''everything is a part of a plan'' :)As Ramayana is an intricate, complex and vast epic, I am unable to post ''Chaupai'' for every explanation here, but I'll try to relate as best I could, So, explaining in chronological order..Ravana, after doing penance for a 1000 years, became successful to please lord Brahma, and as a boon, asked for lots of powers from him, he also asked to make him immortal. Lord Brahma gave him the powers he desired but said that no one can be immortal in this mortal world, but I can provide protection from the beings you want. So, Ravana started naming all the possible type of mighty beings whom he feared, but forgot to name human and monkey, thinking of them weaklings, which later became reason for the incarnation of Lord Vishnu as Lord Ram as a human.After being fed up by the tortures and sinful acts of Ravana and his minions, all the gods and saints ask lord Vishnu for help, and because of the one loophole of Ravana's boon, he decided to help them, by incarnating as a human, Lord Ram.Now, during the battle against Ravana, when Indrajeet, son of Ravana, fatally injured Lord Lakshamana by NAGPASH, Lord Ram, even having power to free him, can't free him because it'll supersede the limits of a human, and will make him a god, making Ravana immune against him.a)Now, as various saints and Shree Tulsidaas Ji has later explained, because of being human, Lord Ram has to show every part, every aspect of human life, which includes sorrow and pain for loved ones        also.                                                                                                              b)It is explained, that Lord Ram has a unique way to reward his devotees, so indirectly he was also giving chance to mighty Shree Hanuman to show his valour to whole world. Even today in almost every temple, don't we see him carrying the mountain peak, which           became the symbol of his valour, might and wisdom.       c) He also knew that Ayodhya will be in the way of Lord Hanuman, and someone will definitely see him, So, by the means of Lord Hanuman, he wanted to convey the message to his family, that it's not too long now.There are many more explanation, deciphered by various saints, and are therefore impossible to mention everyone of them, but still, I hope this will get the notion clear. :)P.S. I just can't hold my self back, and want to tell that, Lord ram didn't banished Goddess Sita to keep up the laws of the land, he did so because he had to keep up the laws of a king, because for a king,'' Rajdharmoh param darmah'' (Duty of the king to serve his subjects is above anything else ).",mid,high,high,low,low

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"I think answer is already there in your question.In my opinion, India is religious, secular and biased all at the same time.First of all I would like to attract your attention on a simple point that to answer this question I am thinking India as a single entity constituting hundreds of culture, mindsets, languages.Is India Religious??It is. India is so obviously religious, that if you'll see a all holiday calendar, that includes all the important dates from all the religions that reside in India, there won't be a single day, that is without a occasion.India is coloured in religion, the most important places in India will not be some architectural wonder, but will be a religious centre.India is so religious that people are running business over it, making it a top grossing industry for god's sake. Is India secular??Generally secularism is defined in a more better way with respect to a person. So, if you talk about India in whole, that if India is secular or not, then YES India is secular. We live together, breathe together, sometime tolerate together, but still we are a single country containing tremendous diversity. We are plural and singular at same time.Some may argue about the feuds, riots and the chaos happening, but before making such argument, just keep in mind that, India and its common people are secular. Persons may or may not be, Groups may or may not be,Political Parties may or may not be, Governments may or may not be. But India is.Is India biased??Now as sad as it may sound, and don't mean to disrespect anyone, India is a country where bias happens on molecular level. From the moment it is known that the coming baby is a girl, she is killed.If you are rich you'll get early entry in temples.You'll get justice, if you have heavy pockets.Well on broad sense it's human nature, to bias, me, you, our, your.you cannot separate it from human, it's just, that India has more causes than any other country to bias. That because of its astonishing diversity, its biased even more.But as a enthusiast, I really feel that the things will change, that there will be a day when, fashion, selfies and status will be more important for youngsters than the difference in religion, because lets face it, it is happening and as depressing as it may sound, it is lesser than the two evils.",mid,high,high,low,low

The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has successfully deployed the six metre diameter S-Band Unfurlable Antenna of military communication satellite GSAT-6 and also raised its orbit. That will increase the reach of military vision.Here is launch history of ISRO,Having said all that, if in the present, war would break, the ISRO itself won't do much of a help directly, but it can assist military forces by having an eyes on territories, which military itself is not keeping eye on.",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"Well, I was thinking on it for quite a some time. Most of the important points are summarized by Quora User and Jim Watkins. As the most answers here in the form of tips and 'dos and don'ts', I'll like to answer it in the form of a personal experience.I am quite a newbie, and actually today is my first quora monthly b'day. :) And frankly, given the spare time I got, I wrote intensively with over 80 answers. So, as for your question, Why is it so damn hard for new writers to get up votes?this is what I came to know,New writers have less followers. More followers means more carriers to carry your answer around the quora realm, period. It is simple equation. More the people who read your answer, more chances of getting up votes. I started with 45 followers, even when I wrote some decent answers, I don't get even up to 30 up votes. And believe me, you are still most welcome to read my answers :)There are some great question, which can procure up votes, but they won't, because,1) Lots of brilliant subject experts are there, who'll write it before you. And after that, in polite words, nobody will read yours.2)Because the question, even being great, is not popular among quorans itself.And the most important point of all. You'll never know, which one of your answers gets viral and why. As being a newbie, my two answers got viral till now, and I honestly don't know, what made them go berserk. One of them is a excerpt from 'The Kite runner' and the other one is some joke I read somewhere and felt a nice example for that particular answer.So my advice to you fellow newbie quoran,As for the up votes, don't look at them right know, neither be mad about your followers.JUST KEEP READING, UPGRADING YOUR KNOWLEDGE BANK, AND AT LAST KEEP WRITING.As you'll write, write good, your followers will eventually increase. So does chances for up votes. Once in a while, try to answer questions related to movies or tv-series or topics with large fan following, it'll boost you up.Don't answer where there are already too many and always proof read it, before you post it. And as for you, along with up votes also keep in mind that quora can be both, Pandora's box and Christ's cross, depending upon how you indulge in it. Apart from being popular you can obtain a great deal of knowledge too. Follow, brilliant people, active quorans (you can find them by searching the top writers of respective years ). And trust me it'll be more fun that way.CAUTION: Don't get addicted to it, it causes bad hangovers. :)Sorry for long answer. I am just high on quora. :)Good luck.",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"I'll tell you an instance, hopefully it'll get the notion clear.There was an English teacher in my school, now he got transferred to some other place. He used to teach from 6th to 10th class as he was a T.G.T ( trained graduate teacher). This is a designation in schools Under central government. He taught a girl in 9th class. That girl completed her graduation, gave the test to be a teacher in kendriya vidyalaya sangathan, (central school organisation) became a teacher for primary classes, got promoted to T.G.T, then to P.G.T, then to vice-principle, and then to principle.And that sir, today is still a T.G.TAnd this year the son of the principle mother, sat in IIT, and getting again benefit from reservation policy. He is a sharp kid and don't need it, but he will get it anyway.Any policy can be good or bad depending upon the type and method of implementation.Reservation should be on the basis of financial status, not on the basis of caste, because a poor general category kid faces the same problem as poor kid of any other group . These policies are breaking down the society more than they are benefiting it.After all, if we all want to talk about equality, why don't we update the definition first.",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"That's the beauty of it.I'll provide two explanation, both with respect to Hinduism and Vedas.WITH RESPECT TO HINDUISMI think its one of the beauty of Hinduism, that it do not tell you who to pray.Even if someone argue with your logic, you both will be right at the same time. Because, whether you want to pray to Shri Ram, Shri Krishna or Shri Vishnu, its up to you. Because you will be as Hindu as any other person, without your faith being questioned.                              You are asking that why not to pray only to Shri Vishnu, but even if you don't want to pray him at all, but you feed a hungry person instead, you'll be serving more to his cause than by praying to him. WITH RESPECT TO VEDASAccording to vedas, Lord Krishna had more qualities or ""Gunas"" than Lord Ram, specifically all the ''14''( maximum )comparative to Lord Ram who possessed ''12''. Lord Krishna showed more of a divine side of Lord Vishnu, whereas Lord Ram showed more of a humane side of him.                                    So, as Shri Ram is worshiped for his righteousness, morality, forgiveness and dutifulness Lord Krishna is worshiped for his childhood mischief, pure love and divinity.Obviously they are the forms of Shri Vishnu, But as the Indian Vedas say, Its the deeds of a person who defines him.P.S.

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"YES! .. or was it I DO..?? :)I am a profound admirer of the traditional weddings. I love them since I was  a kid. In my ""mama's"" (maternal uncle) wedding,when I was in third standard, I earned an amount of more than 3,000 rupees, which was an big achievement for kid Ayush. It fascinated me how the whole house was decorated and how my uncle was central attraction of every ceremony. How good the food smelled and how good it felt to play hide and seek in the amiable kingdom.                          Of course it never would have been possible, if it would be conducted in a ostentatious restaurant, digesting the gourmet and clapping on the discordant speeches.                         After reading some of the answers here, all those who nay the practice, are giving the reasons such as highly outrageous prices and its burden on the girl's family or the pompous show off tendency. But I think tradition is nothing to do with pompousness, because standards are created by human and not by traditions.                        For example, I would like to complete my marriage ceremony by rounding 7 rounds and amid chant of ancient chants of vedas. I would like a elegant ceremony, in a place where no neighbor is disturbed. I would like to divide the expenses with my spouse's family and the responsibilities also.                        At the end, what matters is happiness, and we all know that money can't buy everything. Obviously it can book a beautiful marriage garden but you get the gist.P.S. I would also like to avoid bridegroom's parade on the road, why to stop the traffic, just because you're getting married, there are enough traffic lights already.. :)",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"Oh! man, this might open Pandora's box.. :DThere are countless priceless memories, but one of the best is,CLASS 6th:Recess bell just rang, we ran out of our classrooms, with our lunch boxes, in one of the student grounds. The student ground we chose to sit, was undergoing some renovation. It was being watered and caressed. Weeds were plucked out, new flowers were sown. and again IT WAS BEING WATERED.                   After eating our lunch, we still got some spare time left, to play, pakdam-pakdai ( it's a classic Indian game, where children chase after one other to touch them). While we were playing, I came across a puddle of water, I tried to jump it, but slipped and fell on my back. My milk white shirt's whole back was covered with brown mud.                  The incident happened when we returned to classroom,in the next lecture. He was taking rounds in the class, and I was trying my best to hide my back. But he caught on to me and the thing he said to me was,'' Son, What do you guys really do in the Lunch?''CLASS Xth:I just won a big award. But the teacher administrating that particular field decided that, It should be given again to me in front of all the related team members, students aspiring for same goal, teachers and Principle. And it was decided, that the award ceremony would be held in the Convention Hall. And to make matter worse, It was told me the day just before the award ceremony.                                      There was a dress code, for that ceremony,similar to like we all have to wear a sport dress, on a particular day of week in school. But the thing was, that the navy blue pants that I had to wear, were thrown into washing machine,to be washed the next day, and they were incurably dirty. And you know as a lazy kid, it was out of my universe to wash that piece of cloth by my self, and that so by brush and soap.                                       So, realizing that there is no other opportunity, I decided to wear navy blue pants of my father. My height was similar to him and as I was a growing kid,  I thought that with little adjustments it'll fit me.But as it resulted out, that I was looking like a kid, who was wearing a sack instead of pants. Having no other way out, I decided to go for it.                                      That day, I was standing on the centre stage, holding my pants tight, so that they won't get down, keeping my head down, so that my eyes won't meet the eyes of my friends, who knew my situation . Counting every second that passes. And what happened later is another thing to tell.. :) :)P.S. I called out to my teacher, '' Dad, he is cheating'' in front of whole class, little to tell what happened after it.. :) :)",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"I, in my college, am a member of a street play society.those who do not know what a street play is, its a form a dramatics, which we perform on a busy street, between common people.The play is based on a theme,generally a social evil which is directly related to common people.So it is a form of art thriving to bring some change in society.you can search youtube for street plays and you will be astonished..So, the point is making a street play is not easy, the whole team wakes day and night to create something beautiful.it takes hours and hours, days and days of practice and work..whats more harder is to maintain a personal life along with it..Continuous and non stop work result in unavailability of time for anything or anyone else. Soon tension starts to rise between you and your family and your spouse ( in my case my girlfriend). On the other hand it just piles up so much inside yourself too that every word leaving your mouth will feel rude.And hence there comes a time when you reach your breakdown point, and you can't take it anymore. At that time my friend these are the things i do..GO DIRECTLY TO FAMILYSo here's what you should do first..Go straight to your family, your loved ones, your girlfriend/boyfriend..because the first thing you need to do is to throw what's piling inside you outside. And no one other than your loved ones will hear you patiently, without judging, without criticizing..Go to your parent, mother or father whom you are close to, your spouse, your sister, because at first they may scold you, complaint about you not giving your time to them, but after some fireworks they will support you in the way no one other in the world can..Family is a non ending treasure, spend it, and use it wisely.   2. FORGIVE YOURSELFIt may seem some psychological bullshit, but believe me my friends this helps a lot. Before you say sorry to anyone for your unavailability, say sorry to yourself that you lost so much. And immediately after that forgive yourself, because the turns of event were not in your hands, you did what you got to do and this all will be over soon.Attain some mental piece. and have confidence that you can get through this. Hope should be there before anything.   3. DO WHAT CAN REFRESH YOUDo what really refreshes you which is not remotely related to your work.Just forget your work, throw it out of your mind for sometime and just give some time to your self.How can you give time to someone else, when you don't have it even for yourself. Play cards, watch tv, go out on a ride, talk to someone special,  Anything that brings you out of the monotonous wheel.  4.START SOME WORK, AND WHATEVER YOU DO, DO WITH PASSIONNow when you are back on track, find some work immediately before you go back to that passive state. And do it with full zeal. Think of as why are you doing this and if you gave your even 99% and not 100% it will be unjustice to the work and the people doing it with you..It may seem little off the direction the question is asked, but there were so many answers on that matter, i just want to give a new angle that almost everybody sees through...P.S. Its my first answer, forgive me for any mistakes.. :)",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"As to how I am understanding it, I think its an excellent question and is already boggling my mind.Your question is divided in two parts, namely ''intolerance of values and people'' and '' creating a separating line between a fallen and risen society''.So, I'll try to answer, in similar way. 1) Why do the vast majority of people mistake intolerance of values as intolerance of people? First of all, its not a mistake. We do despise the people who don't agree with us. I just now had a argument, with my friend who was not understanding my explanation of a mathematical problem, and later hung up on me.Greek emperor Commodus killed his own father because he didn't agreed with him. History is filled with abysmal number of such examples, and even today there are news of hundreds of hate crimes committed on this base alone.          Two largest religions of the world fought for over 5 centuries to prove that the religion they follow is better than the other one and killed god-knows-how many people over it.          Its not an illusion, but we actually don't tolerate people, who don't agree with us. Even in daily life we try to remain calm as best as we could. But may be even for moment, we do abhor them.2) Isn't it time to draw a line between two?Let me make my point with the help of an example. You live in a home and are a part of a big family that lives together. In our observational system, there are two people, YOU and your COUSIN. You both are best friends also. You are bright kid,but your cousin not so much. You gained everybody's attention. They helped you better, took care of your studies, you got better resources and eventually you made a successful career. On the other hand, while everybody was giving you the attention, he came in contact and became influenced with a bacchanal uncle and with time, slipped from his path, and landed on in-docile conditions.              Now, being the best friend and as a human, what should you do?Draw a ignorant line between you two and let him suffer just because you don't agree with him OR help him rise on his feet and show him how to walk.             Mine answer would be same as yours. It's not big a deal, to improve your conditions, make yourself happy and be satisfied. But the greatest person, thought to elevate those around them and made the world a better place.             Making line is not a solution, neither is falling to their level. But elevating them to our level is what should we do.3) How do you correct this glaring mistake?By not doing anything to any other person that we don't want to happen to ourselves. By agreeing with the person, if he don't agree with us. By not bothering by others mistakes. By forgiving and by giving them one more chance.              You stated that bison and deer graze different shouldn't be consider intolerance. TRUE. But that change must start from you.              Because as it is said in ancient Indian Vedas..        यही पशुप्रवृत्ति की आप आप ही चरे ! वही मनुष्य है कि जो मनुष्य के लिए मरे !!     ( Animal is the one who graze for himself, Human is the one who dies for others. )",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"ANSWER: If a full out war breaks, we'll lose. We may survive. But we will lose badly.EXPLANATION:Let's look at it analytically and analyze the situation step by step,We are 7 billion in whole. They consist of more than 8 million species spread in every or any terrain possible. At any time, it is estimated that there are some 10 Quintilian (10,000,000,000,000,000,000) individual insects alive. And we are excluding other biological classification.Our strength: Our high-tech weaponry and technology, already established communication system, and our undying will to survive.         Our weakness: We are bulky beings, easy to target, Dependency on animals for food.Their strength: Huge advantage of number, tremendous diversity, ambit on almost whole earth.                                                                        Their weakness: When fighting together, Virtually none. If any, can be controlled by vast numerical strength.Their opening strategy can be deadly, they can be offensive without almost negligible preparation. They can attack directly on human beings all over the world or they can use more coy and subtle ways to maneuver the war. They can destroy our food supply. Locusts and vermin eating our crops and stored food, mosquitoes and flies polluting the water sources etc. Birds can fly into jets engines and octopus into submarines' propellers to bring them down.In the beginning, we have no other way than to be on defensive. We have to start manufacturing special costumes, weapons, bio weapons because we cannot use the existing weapons directly because of the existing human populous. But by the time we would have created enough of them to make a difference, enormous number of lives would already had been lost. We could kill large animals and bombard grasslands of Africa and America. But it will make matter far worse for us too, because we will be destroying natural resources and environment simultaneously.When there is a war between two countries, one wins and other loses. A war where human fights human, and where all of them are thirsty for blood. I don't think we have the slightest chance, because when they'll hit us with pure vengeance spirit, 90% of world would be indulged in poverty, diseases, social networking and questioning and answering on quora.",mid,high,high,low,low
Ayush-Bajpai-6,"First of all I would like to tell the fellow people who already answered and who will answer in future is that, this saying is said by Acharya Chanakya, one of the greatest Indian diplomat and teacher of all time, who taught in Takshila University, who single handedly defeated whole of Nanda dynasty, establishing Maurya dynasty, making his student Chandragupta maurya, the ruler of India, of whom the great Ashoka was a descendant.                                   Now to the question, I'll like to say that, the sayings are from 300 BCE, in accordance to Indian culture back then and also considering different scenario's.                                   According to recent researches, females have stronger immune system than males and to maintain that, they need almost twice that of healthy calories than the man needs.                                    Thy shyness and the daring are in respective of the role of women as a wife and as a mother, as for a women, there were various restriction at that time, and it was considered good manners, to cover your face in front of elders. And we all know that a mother would show impossible strength and courage to save her child.                                     And the last one was in reference to the intensity by which a female would experience sex comparative to men. It is scientifically proved that, and i would like to quote what Ryuichi Kaneko and Dr. Kunio Kitamura, renowned Japanese writer and neurologist wrote in their co-authored book that females emit 10 times theta waves than males while experiencing a sexual climax, means 10 times stronger.The lessons of Chanakya on Diplomacy and social behavior are dead accurate even in today's modern times. Although his writing on female behavior will be considered sexist in today's times, but at that time, they were according to Indian patriarchal society.

Size of atom, distance between galaxies, temperature of sun, but we'll never be able to comprehend it.LOVE, actually it should top the list.WORK OR FATE, we can never actually determine which one is more mighty. Fate decides what'll you become, or your work decides it, it'll always be enigma.TIME TRAVEL, even after all the thermodynamic hurdles and entropical restrictions, if any day time machine comes into existence, you'll never know because most probably the inventor, would go in the past to screw or unscrew the things and would probably never tell the world. And it would be for good. Just imagine the world where anybody have access to infinite time-space travel. Stop trying, because you can't.FLAWS OF MATHEMATICS, You can cut a 1 meter thread into three perfect and equal parts but cannot accurately divide 1 by 3, I don't understand why.DEATH, which will be always the greatest conundrum of all time, because let's face it, no one actually lives to tell the secret.There are large number of such examples, and most of these will remain unexplained, at least in near future.",mid,high,high,low,low

Ayush-Bajpai-6,"Let me begin my answer with this beautiful quote from A Walk To Remember by Nicholas Sparks.. Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes.Well to be honest, I don't think I am qualified enough to answer this question, but then again who really is??Well, I think ,Love is  to want to see her face every single morning.Love is to see the moon and remember her by its shining. Love is to let her take the last piece of pizza. Love is to wander with her from Paris to Giza. Love is to write a song for her on the guitar. Love is to teach her how to drive a car. Love is to sit in the shade of her curly hairs. Love is to carry the feel, heart can hardly bear.Love is to let her win, any game she plays. Love is to surprise her in new and amazing ways.Love is to fight for her, even if luck runs out.Love is to be with her when destiny hits a clout.Love is the river, with which you have to flow.Love is to , if the need be let her go.And we talk about love as if it could only be between the lovers..but we all know that's not true, as..Love is from parents, warm and pure,they will remain hungry, but they'll fill your belly for sure.Love is to think of you as an angel, whatever you do,Love is to always be caring, supporting and special friends too.Love is from siblings, that is as innocent as it can be.although you have to look harder, as it is hard to seeThey'll make your lives hell and will always fight.but at the times of joy, will hug you so tight.They'll break, they'll cry, they'll hit, they'll lie,but  they are the ones who don't let you say good bye.it's the most I can think of right now.

Harsh-Gupta-17,"NO, India should not ban Internet PornographyFirst of all I don't think the number of rape cases in India are increasing. The number appears to increase because the number of reported cases are increasing. The number of the reported cases are increasing because the victim now think there is someone to listen to them. There is some correlation between porn and rape.Social effects of pornographyBut banning porn can have other disastrous side effects,Banning porn will be technically infeasible. In my college porn is banned. You cannot just simply open an watch porn website and watch it, but there are always workarounds. You can a proxy websites, many times you find them  blocked too. If it doesn't work you can use tor. People can always find a workaround. Or you can just search porn images on Google Images they cannot possibly ban google Images. Though it is not a good method but can work.Banning internet porn can open other and much more dangerous methods of access porn. If somehow government completely ban internet porn, people will find other methods. There may come a day when you find porn movies being sold with the regular movies in a roadside stall. If government curb is somehow the restriction can lead to porn smuggling.Banning porn can lead to much more restricted and censored web.The internet is all about freedom. Here people have the power the produce content and distribute it and this many times have great political influences. So the people in power may use this newly gained power to censor internet to block other things which works to their disadvantage. And that is bad for everyone.",mid,low,high,low,mid
Harsh-Gupta-17,"I  have not seen the gymkhana elections yet but the elections in our hall  was quite interesting I think it is appropriate share the experience in  this question.Two  weeks before the actual elections took place notices were put asking  for names of the people who want to contest elections for different  posts. My hall has only first year UG students and PG students and  research scholars. So, even freshers were allowed to contest elections  for some post. Some people who were interested began gathering their  friends for campaign. Some people were campaigning alone going room to  room wing to wing telling who are they, for what post they are  contesting elections and why we should we vote for them. The evenings  were filled with candidates coming and going. There were many names I  rarely remembered any. Soon our hall ended up with parties 'India  United' and 'Kharagpur Knight Riders'. They were campaign in group and  collecting email ids and phone no. One party even sent election  manifesto by mail. And the agenda included things like providing a cycle  repair shop in hall (the hall was just one year old and still under  construction), providing washing machines improving mess and other  stuff. I  don't have much idea about the Polt involved. There was some guy who  was contesting election for general secretory library he proposed  something let's say X. Another guy who was also contesting for the same  post was campaign saying that X is not feasible it cannot be done with  the budget for library, the other one just want to get elected and he  won't be able to do anything.Day of election came and the voting was in  the evening and it wasn't a holiday so they couldn't campaign. I  think the hall council election are very much similar to elections at  state or country level. Most of the junta doesn't care about the  elections and don't even know the name of the candidates. Some who do  care don't know much about the candidates and don't take the pain to  find out more about them (unfortunately that included me). They only one  who were really interested were either contesting the elections or were  part of the campaigning  team. Remove names for the top most posts I  was unaware of even the names of most of the candidates. So, almost all  votes were given on random parameters, this guy is in my department (roll no were given by side of the names), he  is in X society etc.",mid,low,high,low,mid
Jay-Bazzinotti,"I like the story of the Varyag, the Chinese aircraft carrier made by the Soviets that the Americans tried to prevent them from getting. The story goes back many years to the 1970s. In an attempt to challenge the Americans the Russians decided to build a pair of aircraft carriers, the Khunyetsov and the Varyag. The Khunyestov was completed but the Russians lacked much of the technology employed by the West, for example, they had no catapults for their planes, so they build ski jumps on the front of the carrier. This does work, but it also acts as a big sail on the front of the ship. While the Khunyetsov was fitting out, the Varyag was being completed by the Ukrainians on the Black Sea. Being built by the Russians, the Khunyetsov promptly caught fire and broke down on its first mission and had to be towed back to port where it sat for four years. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union was starting to unravel. In order to save money the work on the Varyag was halted and whatever could be used on the Khunyetsov was taken off the Varyag and put on the other carrier. For awhile Varyag was used for other purposes such as a barracks, a shore side prison, a warehouse and so on. But little by little all the valuable materials and metals started disappearing from the ship. After awhile the Varyag was a massive rusting hulk listing heavily and totally abandoned. Almost anything of value was gone. The Soviet Union had broken  up and the poor Varyag was of no interest to anyone. It fell into the hands of the Ukranians who were also not interested in a poorly built and designed Russian aircraft carrier that was only 60 percent complete, rusting, filling with water and listing at an abandoned pier.Suddenly, the Argentine Tourist Commission entered the picture. They offered to buy the billion-dollar ship for something like 2 million dollars. Their plan was to float it to Argentina and make it into a gigantic floating casino and hotel with a golf course on the massive deck. The Russians grabbed the money and the Ukranians were happy to see the ship leave. It was pumped out and attached to two large ocean-going tug boats and towed from port. Meanwhile, the CIA went to Turkey and convinced them not to allow the Varyag to pass through the Straits of Bosphorous. The Turkish government told the tugs they could not move the ship using the flimsy excuse that the ship might sink and block the shipping channel. For most people that would have been the end of it. But for three years the ocean going tugs were paid to tow the Varyag around the Black Sea. The CIA watched in hope the ship would capsize in a storm or rot through and sink, but it did not. Finally, one night, the tug boats were finally able to slip the carrier through the Straits.(Here we see the listing, rusty  Varyag being towed around the Black Sea)​Only the ship didn't head for Argentina. They headed for China. The ""Argentine Tourist Commission"" was a front for the Chinese navy. The CIA was very angry. The Turks were embarrassed. The Chinese got a sixty-percent complete aircraft carrier that they hired the British to re-design and refit in a Chinese dockyard for only 2 million dollars. Here is the Varyag today as Liaoning, the first Chinese aircraft carrier, courtesy of the bankrupt Soviet Union and the Argentine Tourist Commission. ​",high,low,high,low,high
Jay-Bazzinotti,"In the 1980s it was decided to replace Boston's aging elevated roadway with an underground tunnel. It would be the biggest construction project in American history, building an entire multilane highway underneath a major city without disrupting traffic. It had been likened to performing quadruple heart bypass surgery while the patient was playing tennis. It was budgeted to cost 1.5 billion dollars and take 5 years. In reality, it took 15 years and cost 16 billion dollars. It has been speculated that it would be lucky if only 20 percent of that money was spent on bribes, kickbacks and corruption. As time went on and the budget kept going up, up, up, corners kept getting cut, cut, cut. Important parts of the project disappeared. Entire packages of designs suddenly were cut. Materials were swapped for inferior versions. The  highway, which sits 120 feet below sea level on the harbor, requires constant pumping to keep it dry. Within a year of completion a husband and wife driving through the tunnel were crushed when a  multi-ton ceiling panel collapsed. The woman was killed, the man was able to climb out of the car. It seems that due to cost constraints, lightweight panels were not available for the ceiling so each one -- weighing 1.5 tons -- was secured to the ceileing using epoxy cement. Not only that but the contractor that put them up there had been thinning the cement with sand to save money and increase his profit and paying off the inspectors to look the other way. So when people drive through the tunnel they are underneath panels weighing multiple tons, held up be Elmer's Glue and installed by people who paid off the inspectors to look the other way while they used sub-standard materials. It's now 2015. The 15 billion dollar roadway is full of holes and patched, the concrete walls are cracking and spalling; when it rains, the tunnel fills with water and people worry the ceiling is going to drop on them at any moment. The project was great for the city and has vastly improved the look and feel, the property values and traffic flow. But the execution of the project should have resulted in the execution of many public officials and left the city with a huge debt it is not only a burden but is also dragging down the MBTA, the failed toy train system, also a haven of corruption and incompetence, but that is another story. ​​",high,low,high,low,high
Jay-Bazzinotti,"Yes it is and sucks more and more as you get older. Speaking as a single, 54 year old man who has never been married I can tell you that being alone as you get older is a scary and unpleasant proposition. Now, it's relatively easy to find anyone to marry but it's not just as easy as grabbing the first available woman who will have you and tying the knot. As you get older you become more aware and sure of your values and what you want. If you are not careful you become inflexible and unable to negotiate those values. In the meantime I see around me people my age who not only have experienced the trials, pain and joy of child-rearing, but are becoming grandparents. For a long time while they were changing diapers and coaching little league I was practicing for tri-athlons, traveling the world, doing whatever activity struck my fancy and drove expensive cars. They were the winners in the long run. Yes some, perhaps many, of them divorced but they still have their families and children, they experienced the joy of transferring their knowledge and love to another generation of themselves, not strangers, and they formed intimate bonds with someone special that exceed mere friendship. I don't regret the good times I had or the adventures or the exciting romantic rendezvous but I think all those things pale in comparison to sharing consistent, cohesive moments with someone you build a future with and plan to grow old with, and do. In addition, the silence of being alone is deafening. You can fill your hours with activities, reading, volunteering and more but coming home to an empty house and wondering who will find you if you die alone in the middle of the night, and who will even care,  is one of the most pathetic fears of an aging bachelor's life. I still live in hope that somewhere out there is the love of my life, waiting to be discovered somehow, but it's with increasing fear and doubt that that hope is threatened.",high,low,high,low,high

The Plumber's Motto (good for any job)1) Hot is on the left; cold is on the right2) Payday is on friday3) Shit rolls down hill4) Don't bite your fingernails.B) Two men go camping together but after a week or so alone in the woods they are beginning to get on each other’s nerves so they decide to spend a day apart, each hiking in different directions so that they can clear their minds. Then they will get together at the end of the day and relate their experiences with the hope that the time apart will help bring them together. So the next day each goes his separate way, leaving before the sunrise. At the end of the day they each return to camp and over a beer at the campfire, they relate their experiences. The first man says, “Man, I couldn’t have made a better choice. I hiked off into the mountains before the sunrise and watched the sun rise out of the mountains. Simply spectacular. By noon I was at a crystal clear lake - I could have been the only person in the universe. I skinny-dipped under a waterfall. Later a deer came up and ate a carrot out of my hand. Later, I hiked back and watched the sun set into the mountains. Glorious. What a day.”            The second camper says, “Well it seems like you had quite a nice day. Me, I had hike off into the valley yesterday, thorns and briars the whole morning. Finally, I came upon some railroad tracks and decided to hike them for awhile. Then I came upon this really stacked, naked chick tied to the tracks. So I whipped out my hunting knife and cut the ropes and we made love all day. In every imaginable position, too - backwards, forwards, upside down - you name it.”            The first camper is taken aback, “I had a great day,” he says, “but I must admit I’m really jealous. That’s unbelievable what happened to you. Was she a good kisser?”            “I don’t know,” says the second camper, “I wanted to kiss her, but I couldn’t find her head....”C.  A man took a job as a senior vice president of a large company. It was his first big promotion to a job of this caliber and he was replacing a man who had been fired not long ago. On his first day, he walked into his large office with its skyline view and thick carpeting. While setting up his office, he came across three envelopes in the desk. The envelopes were numbered “One”, “Two” and “Three”. The envelope labeled “One” had written on the front “Open This Now” while the other two said “Do Not Open Yet” on them. He opened the first envelope. A letter inside had been written to him by his predecessor. On it, the former VP told the new VP how to be successful.             “When crisis strikes and you are called before the board, blame the situation on me,” the letter said. It concluded by instructing him to open the second and third envelopes only after the first crisis had been weathered.            Soon enough, in the months following his takeover, things got bad and the new VP was called to account for the situation. He recalled what was written in the first letter and when he faced the stern-faced board of directors, he lashed out at the previous manager and said that the current problems were his fault. The board nodded and agreed and the new VP returned to his office, relieved. When he got there, he opened the second envelope. On a letter from the previous VP was written, “If you are reading this, you have successfully weathered the first crisis. Congratulations. Now when the next crisis comes, blame the economic conditions for the problem.”            After a few more months, things really got bad and the board called the new VP once again for an accounting. Standing before the board, terrified, he cited the weak economic climate and stated that this was the reason for the current crisis. They nodded sagely and agreed, allowing him to return to his spacious office.            Returning to his office, shaken, the VP sat at his desk and tore open the third envelope, now eager to read its words of wisdom.

Jay-Bazzinotti,"270,000 men of the German 6th Armee were invested in Stalingrad in late summer, 1942. For a time it looked like the Germans had continued their winning ways, but the Russians were springing a trap that upset the entire war. By February, 1943 the last Germans radioed their final message, ""....we are the last seven survivors in this place. Four of us are  wounded. We have been entrenched in the wreckage of the tractor factory  for four days. We have not had any food for four days. I have just  opened up the last magazine for my automatic. In ten minutes the  Bolsheviks will overrun us. ..."" The German leader, von Paulus, and 90,000 men surrendered. Within a month half of the men who surrendered were dead. Most of the survivors were forced to march to a prisoner of war camp in Bektova. Many fell during the march. Those who fell, died. There was extreme brutality at Bektova almost beyond imagining. At one point 900 prisoners were put in box cars for the trip to Siberia, crammed in and unable to sit, with no windows, no latrine and no food or water. It was thirty degrees below zero. When the locomotive finally arrived five days later, every single man was dead. The latrine was a long deep pit with a log across it. For fun the Russian guards would wait til it was loaded with prisoners, then they would roll the log causing them to fall into the cesspit where they drowned in their own shit. The Germans discovered that the cattle corn they were occasionally fed would not digest so at night they would sneak to the cesspit and strain that ocean of shit for the undigested corn kernels to grind, mix with sawdust and make cornbread.  It must be remembered that the men who surrendered at Stalingrad were already in very poor shape. There had been no consistent food for weeks. Cannibalism was a common occurrence. In ""Survivors of Stalingrad"" a soldier describes how he must have his leg amputated but asks to keep the leg because it still has some fat on it for stew, and no one sees this as an irrational statement. The leg disappears but later someone brings him a cup of stew. He doesn't ask where it came from. So this broken army, poorly clothed, with no supplies, is forced to march in temperatures approaching -50F at night for miles, without food. So by the time they get to the camp they are already in very poor shape. The main fear was getting sick. Getting sick was an automatic death sentence. At one point it was so cold that the Russians forced the Germans to build barrack shelters from the frozen dead bodies of other prisoners, who froze solid as rocks. About 5000 men of the 6th Armee returned from Russia from five to ten years after the war. The last prisoners came home in 1958. PoW trains arriving from Russia were met by cheering crowds in Germany who mobbed the returning trains. You would have thought the Germans won the war. Surviving soldiers were absolutely stunned as they emerged from the trains to the cheering crowds. Many had had no word from their families in years. Many families discovered relatives they had given up for dead. The soldiers were allowed to return to their homes if their homes still existed. There is a photo of a despairing German soldier in a threadbare uniform collapsed outside the remains of his home, the fate of his family unknown. This was not an uncommon fate for returning prisoners and just one more in a long line of degradations.",high,low,high,low,high
Jay-Bazzinotti,"I own three of these. They are a masterpiece of design and the gunsmith's art but as a combat weapon they are terrible. For the time they were invented they were certainly a  major advance but the Germans knew the gun was almost useless in combat and replaced it with the P-38. The Luger is manufactured to very tight tolerances and has lots of small moving parts. The magazine is finicky and hard to fit in the gun when you're in a tight situation. The gun is difficult to cock. On the plus side, it's the only gun that has an indicator that tells you there is a round in the chamber and it's very accurate even with factory sights. The weight and balance are excellent and you can hold it out from your body without tiring for a significant period. It ejects the cartridge high and center over your head --  no need for the person next to you to avoid a hot shell going down their shirt (this has happened to me a few times with other guns and it's really painful). Some models had a wooden stock that could be attached to make it a carbine and there was a drum that could be attached (but it was rare and impractical).  However, even a small amount of dust and dirt will jam the action. It requires constant cleaning and oiling. It's a piece of art, not a weapon of war for all climates and terrains.",high,low,high,low,high
Jay-Bazzinotti,"I worked for Cisco for six years. The top salesmen made millions of dollars per year and I wouldn't have traded places with them for all of that money. They were emotionally beaten constantly. I saw men age 20 years in the course of two or three. One ate Tums as if they were candy. He kept the large jar in his car at all times. I went on many sales calls. There were only two kinds of sales people -- those on their way up and those on their way out. The ones the way up would stab you in the stomach with a smile on their face to accomplish what they wanted. They would say absolutely anything it took to get the deal. The ones on the way out were shaken, emotionally washed out regrettful millionaires who can never forget what they did to get where they are. I saw men who made $2 million last year fired with no ceremony for failing to meet quota this year. Cisco had a boiler room where they would hire pretty much any new college graduate who thought they had what it took. They gave them six months then cut without compunction or second thought. It can never be forgotten that Cisco is a money making machine and there are no superfluous parts in the sales force. You operate at 100% 100% of the time and when you show any sign of wear, you are replaced. They are nice about it. There's a great severance package. But there is no sentimentality about it either.

Jay-Bazzinotti,"This has already happened, many many times in real life. Case in point: Boston was settled in 1630 and after awhile the leaders of Boston decided to go to war with the Ponkapaug indians in Canton, about 15 miles away because they were feared to be ""aggressive"". However, the Apostle Eliot, a theocratic leader of the time, begged to be given a chance to convert them to the ways of the White Man, so he was sent to preach the good word. Over time, he was able to convert the Indians such that they began building a settlement of European style houses, farming and fishing and engaging in  commerce. The good citizens of Boston, concerned about the growing economic strength of their neighbors, sent an army and slaughtered every man, woman and child of the Indians to the great disgust of the Apostle Eliot. Today, there is a small crumbling monument with a bronze plaque on the spot in Canton where the Indians once lived and were slaughtered. No one cares to remember the events at all. Eliot went on to do great missionary work, co-wrote the first book published in America (of which two copies survive today) and wrote the first Bible written in the language of the Algonquin Indians. The Governor of Massachusetts, a man named Vine, was later arrested, sent to England where he was tried, convicted and hung for proposing that slavery was wrong and should be abolished from the Colonies. In this story, the White Men are the aliens and the Indians are the indigenous. But the ending is always how it turns out. Someone, either the humans or the aliens, has something that someone else wants and it is fought over until one side or the other is eradicated.",high,low,high,low,high
Jay-Bazzinotti,"On Aug 14, 1998 I was training for a tri-athlon and returning from a 20 mile training ride on my bike when I was T-boned by an elderly driver who had continued to drive despite being legally blind. I went through her windshield twice and was thrown against a tree. She drove away as if nothing had happened. After numerous operations I found myself at home, finally, in my own bed, alone but for my cat. I had multiple compound fractures and movement was extremely difficult. That was ok -- at that point, I didn't feel much like moving. I felt only like sleeping like a dead man. When I did awaken it was to pee in a bottle. My bowels didn't start working again for some time after the accident, so dragging myself to the bathroom was not necessary. However the first time I woke up I found my cat, a 20 pound ginger colored, aggressive tom cat poorly named ""Baby"" sleeping on my bed. He rarely slept on my bed. But that wasn't the unusual thing -- this time he was stretched as long possible against my broken leg with his paw over my thigh. He stretched from my foot to my thigh, like a cat sausage. He stayed there as long as I did. If I did drag myself from the bed to the kitchen or the bathroom, he would return to that position as soon as I got back into bed. He often licked the plasma dripping from my wounds no matter how often  I tried to stop him. The cat clearly knew something was wrong and also knew what it was and did what he could to make it better -- keep it warm. As I got better he returned to his old routine of ignoring me from the couch. I had that cat for 15 years and I loved him from the day he was born. He was not a friendly cat, but he sure as hell was loyal.",high,low,high,low,high
Jay-Bazzinotti,"You can fool yourself into thinking you are happy by plastering a fake smile on your face for a few as five minutes. Your mind says, I don't smile unless I am happy, and yet I have been smiling for a long time -- therefore I must be very happy. And your mind makes it so. You will be giddy. If you don't believe me, try it sometime. Hold a fake smile for as long as possible, let's say for your entire commute to work. By the time you get to work you will be in an excellent mood and everyone will notice. You can improve your own self esteem by telling yourself you are a good person and love yourself every day. It makes a huge difference in your attitude if you approach your world that way and attitude is the number one determinant of your success or failure. You can change how people approach and respond to you by how you respond to them. Mark Twain used to say his effusion was inversely proportional to how well he knew the person. The less he knew them the more he acted like they were his best friend with big smiles and words of praise and so forth. Go into Starbucks and give it a whirl. When it's your turn, put a huge smile on your face and laugh with the barrister, point something out about them you like, their hair that day, the shirt they are wearing, the way they flip the cup -- ANYTHING -- and watch their day change from mediocre to excellent. It probably won't get you a free coffee but there' a better chance they will remember you next time and you will have made their day -- and the people behind you will smile too.Ask people for tiny favors, especially important people or people you want to like you. At first ask them for tiny things, like what time it is or if they can do something simple they are unlikely to refuse. Benjamin Franklin used to say that getting someone to lend you a book, particularly a book they liked, was the best way to get them to START to like you because in your brain you only do favors for people who count or people you like, therefore, if I am doing a favor for you, I must therefore like you, and then your brain makes it soAlways, always, always face every situation with a can-do attitude. Never say no, or ""that's no my job"". Agree to do what you can do then work out how to shift the work to someone else later. Always have a smile on your face at work. When you enter a room in the morning say, ""Good morning, colleagues!"". Within a week they will be looking forward to your presence and wanting to help you. When someone stops you in the hall to talk, turn 180 degrees to face them and STOP. In their mind it will make them feel that you are very important to them. ""Body Glossing"" research has been extensive over the years research shows that the more someone turns towards you as they walk away from you the more important you are to them. This will build up their idea of themselves and people want to be around those who make them feel important. Only say one thing about yourself for every ten things you say about the other person. Ask them questions, drill down, actively listen, comment on what they say. You can disagree with them if you are polite but listen. In the end, relate your own life to them in a simple way that makes you seem like them. Make it seem like you are imparting an important part of yourself.. People love to tell their own story to someone who will listen and want to associate with people like themselves. It's also been shown that people like other people who provide intimate details of their own life, even if it's not an uncommon thing. To make friends and make people like you then you have to show you trust them by risking telling them something about yourself -- but only something, not everything -- it's always better to let them do most of the talking.These are just some simple things that Social Pyschology has gleaned over the years, there are many more in any SocPsy college text book.",high,low,high,low,high
Udita-Pal,"This guy is my inspiration :DThe life of visually impaired people hasn't changed much even with the recent technological advances. At present trained guide-dogs are used by visually impaired to help them reach the final destination. But these aids are very expensive, more so in India. Further, technology aids using voice feedback based devices aren't helpful either to the blind as they block their inherent sense of hearing. They use their sense of hearing to avoid traffic, crowds, and obstacles. Anirudh Sharma has come up with another alternative, Le Chal, which is an unobtrusive navigation aid for the visually impaired.The basic idea behind Le Chal innovator of the year Anirudh Sharma, 24 Haptic shoe for the visually impaired Ducere Technologies, Bangalore is that one of the user's shoes will provide haptic feedback, guiding the user toward their destination by vibrating in the front, back, or on either side. A vibration on the front indicates that they should keep going straight, a vibration on the left side means that they should turn left, and so on. The user begins by speaking their destination on Google Maps, using their Le Chal-apprunning Android smart phone.That phone then communicates using Bluetooth with a LilyPad Arduino circuit board located in the heel of the shoe. Following the Google-supplied turn-by-turn directions, along with locational data from its own global positioning system (GPS) unit, the phone gets the control-board to activate each of the shoe's four vibrators as needed. The vibrations start out low but build in intensity as the user nears points where they have to turn. A proximity sensor in the front of the shoe also alerts the user to obstacles which it can detect from up to 10 feet (three meters) away.This haptic shoe is simple and unobtrusive in design and uses low-cost readily available components and provides tactile feedback to assist the visually impaired in their day-to-day outdoor navigation tasks. All that the user requires is a Le Chal shoe and a mobile phone with GPS. Sharma is now on a mission to fabricate at least 20-30 sub $20 (Rs. 900) Le-Chal kits and distribute it to the visually impaired.Via :- http://www2.technologyreview.com...Or you can also follow this link :-Anirudh Sharma | Fluid Interfaces",high,high,high,low,mid

Udita-Pal,"First of all you..you right over there you are special. Your big specs , that extra weight , those braces and nothing… nothing will take away your beauty from you even your allergy to milk products or peanuts will not take away your beauty from you. Beauty is not always about having dimples , not having pimples , 6 foot height , or slim out of Size 0 diet. Instagram filters can hide your ugly face but not your ugly personality. Stop caring about what people say or what they think about you. Because their feelings will change according to their priorities. There are going to be days when no one will call you up or bother about you or your problems. It doesn’t matter. Because what goes around comes back around. Stop feeling sad or dishearten when you hear your friend is getting engaged or buying Audi or going to Berlin because there will be something you will be having and they don’t. We all have one thing in common. Our greed is endless. No matter what people say about your dreams JUST KEEP ON WORKING HARD FOR IT. Chetan Bhagat didn’t become douchebag overnight (JUSSSSTT KIDDDINNGGG) He worked hard. You have to be serious and dedicated regarding your goals even if it includes playing FIFA Finals 2018. You don’t meet your love of life in one go. You have to let your heart break at least a few times. (Love of life can be buying an Audi , publishing a book or going on date with me) Things don’t work out like this. You have to be dedicated. Do not let small things affect your decision. Whatever happens – happens for good. If god gives you clay , make lot of arts out of it. Your college , Your degree , your marks won’t mean a single thing if you are a nice person (LOL , Actually we belong to a country where placement is checked before heart)Please remember you are not alone.

Vivek-Rai-5,"Coconut                In South Asia,  coconuts are named sriphala or fruit of the gods and they symbolise  complete usefulness, selfless service, prosperity and generosity. The  palms are believed to be the embodiment of the ancient Indian concept of  kalpavriksha, or the tree which grants all wishes. It plays an  essential role in many religious and social functions in South Asia.In Indian mythology, the coconut tree was created by  the powerful sage Vishwamitra to prop up King Trishanku who was  attempting to gain entry into heaven as a mortal but was thrown out by  the gods.The dehusked coconut is always a part of temple offerings in southern  India, where it is split open before the deities, recalling animal and human sacrifices of ancient Vedic-period rituals. They are offered to guests and are used when blessing a house or installing a deity, and in marriage rites. When sanctified during sacred rites, the flesh of the coconut is shared as 'prasad' or food blessed by god. The three 'eyes' of the coconut represent the three eyes of the great god  Shiva. An earthen pot or pitcher, called a purnakumbha is filled with  water and mango leaves and a coconut is placed on top. This purnakumbha is used in the  ritual of worship and adoration of the gods. It is placed  as a substitute for the deity or by the side of the deity.Fishing communities along the coasts of peninsular India believe in appeasing the seas with offerings of coconut.Source: 1.

Vivek-Rai-5,"Height is not only determined by simple law of average, and a lot of genetics and environmental factors have a role to play in. I would like to elaborate a few points on that.Height is not only controlled by a single gene, but a combination of multiple genes, and environmental factors. This stats varies slightly from individual to individual, and often appreciably between different ethnic populations.It is estimated that approx 60 to 80 percent of the difference in height between individuals is determined by genetic factors, whereas 20 to 40 percent can be attributed to environmental effects, mainly nutrition. This answer is based on estimates of the ""heritability"" of human height: the proportion of the total variation in height due to genetic factors.There have been a number of studies trying to estimate heritability of different populations, which would then allow us to directly map the impact of genetic factors to an individual's height.For example, a population of white men has a heritability of 80 percent and an average height of 178 centimeters (roughly five feet, 10 inches). If we meet a white man in the street who is 183 cm (six feet) tall, the heritability tells us what fraction of his extra height is caused by genetic variants and what fraction is due to his environment (dietary habit and lifestyle). The man is five centimeters taller than the average. Thus, 80 percent of the extra five centimeters, or four centimeters, is due to genetic variants, whereas one centimeter is due to environmental effects, such as nutrition.This information can be used to predict an individual's height if the parents' heights are known.For example, say a man 175 cm tall marries a woman 165 cm tall, and both are from a Chinese population with a population mean of 170 cm for men and 160 cm for women. We can predict the height of their children, assuming the heritability is 65 percent for men and 60 percent for women in this population. For a son, the expected height difference from the population mean is: 0.65 x [(175 - 170) + (165 - 160)] / 2, which equals 3.25 cm; for a daughter, the difference is 0.6 x [(175 - 170) + (165 - 160)] / 2, which equals 3 cm. Thus, the expected height of a son is 170 + 3.2, or 173.2 cm, and of a daughter 160 + 3, or 163 cm. On the other hand, environmental effects can add 1.75 cm to a son's height: 0.35 x [(175 - 170) + (165 - 160)] / 2, and 2 cm to a daughter's: 0.4 x [(175 - 170) + (165 - 160)] / 2. Of course, these predictions only reflect the mean expected height for each of the two siblings (brothers and sisters); the actual observed height may be different.But again, these are statistical studies and just an estimate. What actually occurs during the Gamete formation (meiosis), is quite variable and results may actually be quite different.S: http://www.scientificamerican.co...",high,high,high,mid,mid
Vivek-Rai-5,"It'd had been much better had you detailed about how you are preparing right now, and why you seem unsatisfied(?), insecure about your preparation. However, I may make some incorrect assumptions in my answer since I managed to sail through in the first attempt itself. Pardon me for that.Yes, it's absolutely possible to crack JEE Advanced with 6 months of practice. The nature of preparation, the right routine, and almost anything highly depends on what you have learnt in past 3 years, what are the subject areas you find yourself strong or weak, and what is a potential performance inhibitor for you during exams (as in got panicked, nervous etc.,). Without that information, the specificity of answer drastically reduces. Here are my tips:Analyze your past performances: It is highly important for you to go through all your previous performances across different tests, entrance exams, or JEE Adv. itself. It will help you to identify your strengths, and weaknesses and work on them accordingly.Maintain a routine: I assume that you a average grasp of concepts and are able to solve generic problems (state entrance exams, or JEE mains type). After that, I don't think you need to learn any more new concepts, but instead focus on practicing and strengthening what you have already learnt. This is a big mistake done by many students where they keep on learning new and new things, only to flunk at easy-normal questions in exam. Please avoid this. Don't panic, or stress yourself out everyday: There is no need to count everyday hours - just read/solve problems as long as you feel interested. Go out, play. Come back, and then go back to practicing your stuff. If you can do this even for 4-5 hours each day, with enough focus and concentration everything should be fine. It's very important to take care of yourself, and often not doing it is the cause of bad performance.Focus on strong areas: Since, not much time is left, it is unwise to start learning something new altogether which you couldn't understand in past one year. Just have enough idea about it to solve generic problems. It is better to focus on the concepts you are confident about and practice more and more questions on them. It is important. Also, spending much time on Chemistry isn't advisable compared to Maths, or Physics. Having a good score in latter subjects really improves your rank, while the former one can be managed by just a good reading/mild practice.Don't let go of doubts: It's not necessary that you must have doubts in almost everything that you read. I don't believe that unless you have doubts, you don't understand the subject. But it's important to observe the method in the problem, and that any kind of change or trick in the problem can still be tackled by you. So try to explore different possibilities in a problem, remain intrigued, and clear all the doubts you get from a related faculty.While preparing, it's crucial that you don't not get distracted or disheartened. It may happen that you may see your friends enjoying in other colleges, while you are still reading and preparing. Please don't do that. It's not the end, and it never is. Patience, Determination, and yourself, is all you need.I have avoided specific suggestions like - read this topic, don't read this, and so on. As I told you in point number 1, it is your responsibility to critically analyze your strengths and weaknesses. After you have done that, you can easily find a large number of online suggestions on how to improve in each topic. In any case, spend less time searching for stuff, and more on practicing things. One more things, solve all previous year IIT JEE/JEE Adv. questions.Good luck!",high,high,high,mid,mid
Vivek-Rai-5,"The event driven and concurrent connections model of Node.js makes it one of the best platforms for real time applications like online games, collaboration tools, chat rooms, or anything where what one user (or robot? or sensor?) does with the application needs to be seen by other users immediately, without a page refresh.As this answer on Stack Overflow says,My feeling is that Node.js is especially suited for applications where you'd like to maintain a persistent connection from the browser back to the server. Using a technique known as ""long-polling"", you can write an application that sends updates to the user in real time. Doing long polling on many of the web's giants, like Ruby on Rails or Django, would create immense load on the server, because each active client eats up one server process. This situation amounts to a tarpit attack. When you use something like Node.js, the server has no need of maintaining separate threads for each open connection.Although, there exist libraries in Python as well for doing this sort of work, Node.js does it really well (powered by cutting edge V8 JavaScript engine). However, if you are performing some heavy server side computation on receiving requests, then you are better off serving it with regular FLASK based server.Feel free to add more.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Vivek-Rai-5,"I would like to answer your question in a very concise manner. There are already a large number of blogs, articles to recommend you about what you should read or shouldn't, the optimal time to spend a day and other nut-case strategies. I don't wish to add any further. However, I shall the more critical question about what not to do while preparing for IITs.A brief introduction just for sake of completeness. After I passed my High School, I had very less clue about IITs. I just knew that they are an engineering college just like the others and it was supposed to be difficult since my brother couldn't clear it. After a few months of juggling between local teachers in my area, I realized it wasn't worth the effort and hardship I was putting in. I was looking for a solution which would provide me some mentorship and guidance under a single roof and to be spoon fed. So I went for a small coaching institute in the city. Yeah, it wasn't big like FIITJEE nor they might have the best quality teachers in India but I found myself very close to the teachers who taught me. It was one of the best connections I had. I loved being taught by them and kept on studying just like a regular guy. (I have contact with those teachers even now as well)Please note, It was never like a cut throat competition with 16 hours of daily study, extensive mock tests and mindless shit. I was learning through theory and a formal teaching process just like in school. I indeed had occasional tests and quizzes but they hardly made any difference to how I was learning. I began to enjoy things, read a lot of books and things continued.Now back to the point, What I think my mistakes were (which means you should be doing this at your own risk):By  the end of my class 12th, I had developed much interest in solving  subjective problems of Physics, reading concepts of Organic chemistry  which would never come in IIT JEE. This although is good for having  stronger problem solving ability - doesn't turns out to be good for a  limited time screening examination. I went retarded orthodox and longed  for subjective examinations as in earlier days. So, the result was that I  spent almost 75% of my time for Chemistry to one section - Organic  Chemistry. It features few questions in the paper which are easy enough  to be learnt from regular NCERT book.I spent too much time researching online and learning about better techniques (Often the cause of blunder confusion in Organic Chemistry) rather than practicing learning common things.I didn't give enough time for Objective practice. My Physics teacher who himself was an IITian had warned me that probably I should stop getting after Irodov, Krotov, LA Sena and bunch of MIR books. Rather focus on exam pattern and devise time schedule. I did so, but at cost of reduced attention to mathematics while I had to pay later.Last but not the least, I panicked way to much in the examination. After my first paper, I was too nervous (thinking that my performance had been bad) with my mind full of thoughts like - 'Oh I messed up!', 'I'm finished' etc. This made me sad enough to perform worse in second paper (only to realize later that I had scored 40 marks higher in first paper)You now have realized how an idiot I was to perform such silly mistakes. Yeah I agree that no one is supposed to do it, but I don't expect everyone to be me. P.S. If this still doesn't answer your question (or any specific queries) then comment below.",high,high,high,mid,mid

Vivek-Rai-5,"I don't know much about the differences between IIT JEE and ISC board syllabus. But however, I will differ with the opinions offered to you by the others for your preparation. A major fraction of the students appearing and succeeding in IIT JEE examinations are enrolled in their state boards, which in most cases are quite different from the central boards like CBSE or ISC. If they can do it, you can do it too!However, if you take up coaching then the teachers there would follow the module of NCERT books which may not be perfectly synced with your ISC curriculum and thereby causing you a little problem to manage boards and preparation simultaneously. That's why it requires careful management and timing to balance quality and content for clearing the exam.Here are few tips - Complete the topics common to board syllabus and JEE syllabus first. (Infact almost all the topics will be common, it's just that their order or detail may vary.)Pay attention to theory classes in school so that you can get more time to spend on practicing questions at home/tution. This will take care of your school examinations.Try to understand the fundamentals. Board subjects often encourage one to learn or memorize things. Don't do that.

Vivek-Rai-5,"Here is something that I found to be useful :A capacitor's storage potential, or capacitance, is measured in units called farads.  A 1-farad capacitor can store one coulomb (coo-lomb) of charge at 1  volt. A coulomb is 6.25e18 (6.25 * 10^18, or 6.25 billion billion) electrons. One amp represents a rate of electron flow of 1 coulomb of electrons per  second, so a 1-farad capacitor can hold 1 amp-second of electrons at 1  volt.A 1-farad capacitor would typically be pretty big. It might  be as big as a can of tuna or a 1-liter soda bottle, depending on the  voltage it can handle. For this reason, capacitors are typically  measured in microfarads (millionths of a farad).To get some perspective on how big a farad is, think about this:A standard alkaline AA battery holds about 2.8 amp-hours.That  means that a AA battery can produce 2.8 amps for an hour at 1.5 volts  (about 4.2 watt-hours -- a AA battery can light a 4-watt bulb for a  little more than an hour).Let's call it 1 volt to make the math  easier. To store one AA battery's energy in a capacitor, you would need  3,600 * 2.8 = 10,080 farads to hold it, because an amp-hour is 3,600  amp-seconds.If it takes something the size of a can of tuna  to hold a farad, then 10,080 farads is going to take up a LOT more  space than a single AA battery! Obviously, it's impractical to use  capacitors to store any significant amount of power unless you do it at a  high voltage.Here : HowStuffWorks ""Farad""",high,high,high,mid,mid

After doing this book, you would not need much theory to be understood, just few tricks here and there.If you have trouble getting some concepts from this, refer to Resnick Halliday older versions or Feynman books (Don't buy, beg-borrow-steal).The next phase is to practice more and more questions of wide variety. If you like really challenging problems, go ahead with the Irodov directly. Another choice is Physics series by D.C Pandey (Arihant). However, in my opinion H.C.Verma + Irodov is the best combination.In the end, practice all past year IIT JEE Papers. This is a subject agnostic advice.(Extras) Like more challenges?

Vivek-Rai-5,"How can cheating be justified from an universal or absolute point of view. However, as you have pointed out the cheaters indeed tend to argue in favor of their defense. This is however, not limited to examination only. Self deception now applies to everyone in a much more wider sense, it is just that motivations are different.I would like to point out a very interesting study done by Dan Ariely, who does on research behavioral economics. We lie. We cheat. We bend the rules. We break the rules. And  sometimes, as we’ve seen in Greece, it all adds up. But, remarkably,  this doesn’t stop us from thinking we’re wonderful, honest people. We’ve  become very good at justifying our dishonest behaviors so that, at the  end of the day, we feel good about who we are. This tendency is only  getting worse, and, as innocent as it may seem, the consequences are  becoming more apparent and more serious.Cheating has less to do with personal gain than it does  self-perception. We need to believe that we’re good people, and we’ll do  just about anything to maintain that perception. Sometimes, this means  behaving in ways that align with our sense of what is right. Other  times, it means crossing that line, but turning a blind eye to our  behavior, or rationalizing it in some way that allows us to believe it’s OK.In more professional scenarios, our dishonesty is typically fueled by  the desire for wealth or status rather than concern for the reputation  of others. Greed is a powerful motivator.This is what happens during examination. Most of the times, the tendency to cheat is propelled by greed and not by the fear of failing in the examination. If it was so, he would have taken enough caution much earlier to avoid any such situation. However, there are some sources of this tendency. When we see somebody else cheat, especially if they’re part of our own,  internal group, all of a sudden we figure out that it’s more acceptable  to act this way. It’s not that the probability of our getting caught has  changed – it’s that we’ve changed our mindset, convincing ourselves  that the act itself is actually OK. At some point, you just think, “This  is the way things are done,” and you go with the flow.One's inability or lack of desire to perform is getting veritably transformed into new and improved ways to cheat and defend themselves.Every day, people are finding new and more creative ways to cheat, and  to justify their dishonest behavior, regardless of the negative impact  their actions might have on others. What’s most worrying about this  trend is that we still fail to grasp the extent of our dishonesty. But  it doesn’t have to be like this. If, on a global scale, we worked to  understand the root of our dishonesty, and motivated each other to  overcome it, we could do much better.- Dan ArielyP.S.

The first implementation that comes to find is:Find how many elements have been passed to zip.Find the minimum common length of all the iterables passed to zip (since you have to ignore all the extra elements). Let's call this num_itemsCreate a new container of length num_items which will contain tuples consisting of elements from all the containers passed to zip. Call it return_containerGet a iterator (pointer in simple words) corresponding to every item passed to zip. Set it to point to the first elements.Iterate over return_container and in each position i, add elements from the ith position of all of items passed to zip as arguments. This you can do using the pointers you extracted in previous step and by advancing them by one, each time you loop over return_container.Return return_container.This is exactly how the algorithm has been implemented in the original source code, starting from the line 2489[1].

It's certainly great but nothing to worry about if you haven't.Only with this basic set of knowledge in your hands, you can go through different organizations who participated last year and had projects in these areas (there are a lot of them and they participate each year). Look through their projects, the previous year ideas page, what people proposed and think what was novel or interesting about their idea. You may not understand the project or the idea in first attempt, that's why I recommend you not to jump from one organization to other by easily giving up. First of all, skim through the list and select a handful of those which you find interesting. Then, carefully study they do, how large is the developer base, how active they are, what kind of projects did they select (rate on a difficulty levels of your own) etc.,Soon you will find one or few which make more sense to you and are intriguing enough to be explored further (I'm talking about interesting projects, not something that you could understand or code in one shot).Go through their public code repositories and find out which GSoC project contributed what to their original project in terms of code.Try to comprehend that information, understand bit and pieces of it. Just a general flow or nature of the code they wrote.Go through the issues page of the organization. Most likely if there is an active development, you'd find a large number of open issues. They often have labels like easy-to-fix, which should be your first target.Ask for help on those issues, or say that you want to take up the task of solving that. In all likelihood, you'd be encouraged and given directions about solving that bug.Try to solve it. Ask for help again.Keep trying until you make some good progress in it. An important point to note here is that don't judge your work by the number of lines of code you have written, instead think about the problem it helped to solve.Send your pull request, get it merged.Remain in touch with developers and other discussions.Take up more and more issues. This will help you understand the code in a better way and also help you improve your knowledge about programming. In short, you'd get better.This process will be slow for most of the people and may often lead you to frustration. Don't give up. By the time you become a semi regular or regular member at these organizations, time for GSoC application would begin. You already have a rapport with the developers, you have knowledge about the code base, and a fairly good idea of what's missing and what needs to be added. Propose an idea of your own or apply for one of the ideas presented by the community. Discuss, Discuss and Discuss until you feel it's perfect.Best time to start?

Vivek-Rai-5,"If you ever happen to get an opportunity to have Soft Computing Tools in Engineering(CE31501)[1] as a breadth subject, don't miss it.Summary:My friends had this class as their breadth subject. One day I decided that I would rather attend this class (it wasn't part of my semester plan) than spending time aimlessly. Only after a few classes, I realized the potential of this class and the passion of its coordinating professor. Prof. S. K. Barai, is an excellent teacher. He portrays his ideas really well, is patient with students and the best part is that he is always open to constructive criticism. You can reach out to him for any doubts or ideas related to anything and he will hear you with best attention.I registered it as an Additional Course. Pros:The class is a very demanding one - Two Research Paper style term papers, mid-term, end-term and a final class project. You will be introduced to a very broad range of soft computing methods (Fuzzy Computing, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Networks etc.,) that are applied very widely in modern engineering solutions. This class may well stimulate your interest for further study into the field of Machine Learning, Artificial Algorithms and so on. The final project (done n groups) requires real world application of the concepts taught in class and which would be presented in front of the whole class by you and your group. This itself is a very exciting part of the class. You will surely learn a lot of things.Cons:When I say you will learn a lot of things - I mean it. But the fact is that the content won't be in very depth or rigorous to give you a very complete understanding of the topics involved. It will be a broad, generic course where you will see a lot of real world examples and gain an idea about them. So if you are expecting it to be a real ML or AI type of course, then it's better to pick those courses.Also, the treat at the end of semester.[1] : http://softcomputing.tripod.com/...",high,high,high,mid,mid

Vivek-Rai-5,"From the nature of question, I presume you have just started to learn Python or at least thinking to do so. Otherwise, those people who are experienced with it have already figured out how to exploit the strength and weaknesses of the language. If the above situation fits on you, then I must let you know of few general things at first. If you are really undecided about which language to choose or study (very similar to my situation earlier), you must decided how do you want to use it. Whether you are more interested in Web Development, Algorithms, Applications/GUI development or Research field. In other words,Personal preference (programming style etc.)Problem you're trying to solve (availability of libraries etc. is important here).Integration with existing code bases.Once you have figured it out, you won't need to bother with anything else or shit about every other language. But If undecided, you should go for Python! Once you grasp a language you can easily? rope in others (at least I believe so).Now, answering the real part of the question:Python is indeed slower than other languages varying from 3-5 for Java to 5-10 (or beyond) times for C++. However, some cost has to be given in exchange of the advanced functionalities that the language possesses. High Level Language: Python is a higher level language than C/C++, which means it abstracts the  details of the computer from you - memory management, pointers, etc, and  allows you to write programs in a way which is closer to how humans  think.Interpreted Language: The Python is not directly compiled to object code and executed, rather 'interpreted' at runtime. Other interpreted languages such as Java bytecode and .NET bytecode run  faster than Python because the standard distributions include a JIT compiler that compiles bytecode to native code at run time. The reason why  CPython doesn't have a JIT compiler already is because the dynamic  nature of Python makes it difficult to write one.Dynamically typed: One thing that will arguably leave Python slower however, is that it's  dynamically typed, and there is tons of lookup for each attribute  access. With respect to dynamic typing, there are many optimizations that can be  done if you know what type of data you are dealing with.

Learning Python is more like knowing how to use a hammer, what are its parts, its strengths and weaknesses, but it doesn't teach you how to forge metal or shape a stone into beautiful sculpture.I would ask you not to be too much concerned about the exact career path that you'd want to take it. It's highly likely that after few months as you come across any other programming language or a field, you might start hating Python to the core. Focus on building your fundamental skills for now.Take web development for example. Break down the skill into smaller components as to what else you need to be able to do everything from tip to toe. Ask questions and code a lot. Is Python sufficient or learning a bit of JavaScript will help more? Did you like making your first website from scratch?

This force will increase as long as the applied force increases until it reaches the maximum, after which it becomes constant.Consider a vague analogy. Suppose you can eat a maximum of 20 chocolates per hour (this is determined by how hungry you are, what kind of chocolate it is, and so on). This is fixed, and you cannot change it during the described procedure. Now someone starts giving you 5 chocolates to eat per hour. Naturally, you would eat all of it but you cannot eat more than that since there aren't more chocolates to eat. If the rate of receiving chocolates increases from to 5 to 10, 15 or 20, so will your rate of consumption since it's well within you limits.However, once the rate goes above 20 chocolates per hour, you can eat only 20 and have to sadly sacrifice the rest.In other words, you adjusted yourself to the availability of chocolates.

In the process, they maycause mutationsincrease (or decrease) the amount of DNA in the genome of the cell, and if the cell is the precursor of a gamete, in the genomes of any descendants.These mobile segments of DNA are sometimes called ""jumping genes"".There are two distinct types:Class II transposons. These consist of DNA that moves directly from place to place.Class I transposons. These are retrotransposons thatfirst transcribe the DNA into RNA and thenuse reverse transcriptase to make a DNA copy of the RNA to insert in a new location.As is clear from this description, retrotransposons are nothing but a subclass of transposons, which though move from one place to another in  the genome, but by an amplification process where the RNA transcribed from those segments are transcribed back to DNA  (using reverse transcriptase, which retrotransposon encodes) and inserted at a new location within the genome.They are particularly abundant in plants, where they are often a principal component of nuclear DNA. In maize, 49-78% of the genome is made up of retrotransposons.[2] In wheat, about 90% of the genome consists of repeated sequences and 68% of transposable elements.[3] In mammals, almost half the genome (45% to 48%) is transposons or remnants of transposons.

There are many students and teams from IITs that do well enough in international contests. However, you might be tempted due to lower turnout when compared to colleges like IIIT-H. No doubt it's true, but there are several reasons for that.Diverse environment: The culture at IITs is quite diverse. Naturally, It is not expected from everyone to cramp their heads into algorithms challenges. There are quite large number of non programming societies/groups where most of the students are engaged atleast for a year. Varied interest: People have varied interests and expectations which are well supported by IITs. More or less, everyone finds a suitable interest and time to pursue their goals of life. You can find many CS students who don't have any interest in Computer Science  while other non-CS students craving for it.After all this, there remains a very small subset of people who are really focused about being active programmers and participating in algorithm contests.

At this time, their appearance is quiet similar to maggots and have no eyes or major organs.These larvae will grow in size, eventually to the point where they will be ready to take the form of an adult ant.  At this time, larva from most of the species weave a silk-like cocoon around themselves and metamorphose into a full adult.

Do research about the idea and write a beautiful proposal. Next is, you have to make your mentors believe that the feature you are going to add is very important in the org's roadmap.Sometime's a very nice proposal is also not enough.

It is far better than joining any new IITs (you are not even getting Hyderabad).But there are few points where this can be a bad choice1) If you are getting IIIT Hyderbad, go for it! Period.2) If you are getting CSE at BITS Pilani, Awesome! (380+ marks I guess)3) If you care either about CSE or IIT, opt for KGP, followed by BHU and Guwahati.Courses might be misguiding. It is more mathematics and less computer science, but the course is a very good for sure. You should directly contact seniors of both branches 3rd+ year preferred. They actually have experience rather than rumors.JEE cutoff ranks are pure myth. They do not convey properly which branch/college are better.

Himanshu-Mishra-8,"Eyes swollen, Heart pumping unusually, and I finished the one hour long documentary.It simply needs a human to be curious about knowing the opinions of those people involved, the victim's parents, the rapists, their parents, their lawyers and other ones. The things that shuddered me hard were the statements made by the illiterate rapists and so called fully-literate lawyers of them. I wish everyone could know the nonsense statements they have made.The rapist quoted,""A decent girl won't roam around at 9 PM at night. A girl is far more responsible than a boy.Boy and girl are not equal""""A female is like a diamond. Don't put them into roads, a dog will surely snatch it away."" This was the statement by his lawyer.Now first of all, how come some rapists and murderers in such a brutal case, should get a lawyer? And secondly, you are yourself calling your clients those dogs which you mentioned? Then let those strayed dogs be punished, sir.Further he said,""In our traditional India society, we never allow a girl to go out after 6:30 PM."" Seriously? On what ground are you creating a time limit for the days of one complete sex of our country?""You say that the boy she was with was her friend. You are talking about a man and a woman as friends. Sorry that doesn't have any place in our society.""""We have the best culture in the world. And in our culture there is no place for women.""No place for women? You exist in this world because of a woman. You talk about Indian cultures, take out and read the volumes which founded our culture, on every single page of them, you will find respect for those women, whom you want to exclude from the culture. You sir, please do not spit in our own house or rather leave it.""This incident had have to happen, mainly to teach them a lesson."", the rapist said.The lawyer,Upon being asked about pulling 'something' out of her body (her intestines),""He would like to create a damage. He will put his hand... Insert, hit! Putting his hand forcefully inside. It was his right.""This was simply epic coming out of the lawyer's mouth,""If my daughter or sister, engaged in pre-maritial activities by doing such things like going out for movies, I would most certainly would take her to my farmhouse I would put petrol on her and set her alight.""And this one is a suggestion for the girls who are to be raped in future.""She should just be silent and allow the rape.

Ashris-Choudhury,"I'm glad you asked!I don't know 'how' do you love the song, but I was addicted to it. No, 'addicted' is an understatement.. It was more like, the song much like a computer virus had infected me replaying itself in my mind continuously and clogging my thoughts. It would play in my mind when I was reading, in an examination or when I was taking a shower.Putting it less dramatically, it is a very catchy song.Why, you ask? Pay attention to this video that analyzes what makes Taylor Swift's new music so catchy.If you don't wish to watch, I have noted the points he makes.Repetition: Catchy songs have a single distinct tune or chord progression repeated many different times with slight or no variations.Chords dictate the melody: Speaking less technically, these songs are way too patterned. Its like you can almost predict how the tune is going to go because it would be the only obvious choice.Playground approach: Melody dominates in these songs and the chords don't really matter. Its a 'sweet' tune that people like instantly.Repeating lyrics: You have 'Shake it off' repeat over a million times (figuratively, of course) in TSwift's song.Rhythmic displacement: A tune repeats many times and then ties up with a snapping tune completely different from the repeating tune.Now lets look at Chittiya Kalaiyan again. Here's an excuse to listen to the song again.Lyrics: http://sqeets.com/guitar-chords/...Now lets see what is at play here:a. Repetition of lyrics:Chittiyan (4%) + Kalaiyaan (8%)+ ve (12%) + oh (5%) + baby (4%) + meri (4%) = 37%37% of this song is ""Chittiyan Kalaiyaan ve oh baby meri chittiyan kalaiyaan""If we ignore the rap which most people do, the song is close to 50% made up of one single line.Then there are the rhyming words:kara de, pavaa de, dikha de, diva de which further add repetition in the song.b. Repetition in music:Chittiyaan [G]kalaiyaan veOh baby [Bm]meri chittiyan [G]kalaiyan veChittiyaan [G]kalaiyaan veOh baby [Bm]meri white [G]kalaiyaan veChittiyaan [G]kalaiyaan veOh baby [Bm]meri teri hise [G]ayiaan veChittiyaan [G]kalaiyaan veOh baby [Bm]meri chittiyan [G]kalaiyan vehas the same melody, progression and chords irrespective of the lyrics and hence gets stuck on your head.Notice how the song also uses the same technique that Taylor Swift does: using one tune multiple times and then snapping it up with one different tune. Like here:Man [G]ja ve, mainu [D]shopping kara deMan [G]ja ve, romantic [D]picture dikha deReq[D]uestan payian [G]vec. Its a sweet song. The tune is pretty cheerful and hence makes for a nice listening, say waking up. I am not embarrassed to mention that it was my alarm tune at one point of time.And hence, the happy element and the repetition together fuck your brain.I rest my case.I leave you with the current virus clogging my mind.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Ghosts, I believe are mere manifestations of the mind's fantasies and have no existence in realms of science. Their existence can be disproved, or atleast rebutted on two grounds.Scientific: Any object, entity or whatever, in order to be seen, needs to possess mass. Why? We see things because light bounces off from the object and reaches our eyes. For ""bouncing"", light ""photons"" need to collide with something. And by elementary physics, it can be proved that the object needs to have a mass, in order to cause something to deflect. So? So, any thing that has mass cant levitate unless a force manages to counteract its weight. And hence, the ghost will be doing work against gravity, or expending energy to do this action if it moves or floats as people report. So, if ghost is that energy, it should eventually deplete and fade off. Psychological: Why is every ghost a lady in white with long hair, or a beheaded person, etc? Ever heard of a cat ghost or a spirit of a sunflower or amoeba souls taking revenge on humans for making vaccinations? We project our ideas the way we would be most afraid of. Fear is a form of entertainment. That explains why people are so crazy about some spooky movies. Even in real life, we like to be frightened, making stories that are divine or spooky, either way. Hence ghosts merely lie in the mind, made up of your thoughts only..",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Hell no.Old Bollywood songs were just as shitty as the new ones. In other ways, the new songs are just as good as they were before.Don't throw chairs at me, calm down and hear.We listen to only those old songs that were of good quality, that had meaning and hence stood the test of time. The bad ones from the past are not remembered by anybody and hence we never get to see the 'poor' face of the Olden times.Currently, we are exposed to all types of songs in the New Age, with the digital media, we are consuming songs more rapidly than ever. We see both the good and the bad ones and hence on contrast to the only good old ones, the 'New Age' overall seems bad.Let me illustrate.Consider this song by Kishore Kumar from the movie Aasha(1980)""Ina meena Dika, Daai, Daamo nika Maaka naaka naaka, chika pika rika Ina meena dika dika de daai daamo nika Maaka naaka maaka naaka chika pika rola rika Rumpum posh rumpum posh"" Here's another gem from movie Tarazu(1997)The song is literally just 'I have the urge to urinate, what do I do?'Su su su aa gaya mein kya karuSu su su aa gaya mein kya karuSu su su aa gaya mein kya karuSu su su aa gaya mein kya karuO aa o aa eJaa ke ghar mein kar ke aaO aa o aa eMujko pagal na banaO aa o aa eJaa ke ghar mein kar ke aaO aa o aa eMujko pagal na banaSu su su aa gaya mein kya karuSu su su aa gaya mein kya karuSu su su aa gaya mein kya karuSu su su aa gaya mein kya karu hatHere's one more, from the movie Sanam Bewafa(1991)Angoor Ka Dana Hoon, Sui Na Chubha Dena (x2)Sui Jo Chubhai To Ras TapkegaJo Ras Tapakega To Kis Miss Kis Miss, Kismis Ban JaaungiAngoor Ka Dana Hoon, Sui Na Chubha DenaSui Jo Chubhai To Ras TapkegaJo Ras Tapakega To Kis Miss Kis Miss, Kismis Ban JaaungiAngoor Ka Dana Hoon . . . . . .

Ashris-Choudhury,"Before I write an answer for this question, I want to give some context.After four years of my education in Architecture, I have realized that people have very ambiguous idea of a 'well architected' building. The sad thing is, the common public mistakes 'beauty' and 'aesthetics' as the only thing that Architecture deals with. A fancy weirdly shaped building is mistaken for an 'Architectural Marvel'. I call bullshit on that. Source: WikipediaThe ""Walt Disney Concert Hall – Los Angeles"" was revealed in 2003 and over the years neighbors complained about it. This was due to the fact that the panels on it were so shiny that sunlight was being reflected directly into their apartment. This caused the temperature to rise by around 15 degrees Fahrenheit and so residents had to use air conditioning more. The team behind the design covered the panels with cloth in 2005. This, is an example of a bad architected space.It is easy to call the whole field of Architecture 'subjective' just because like art, every building will be liked or hated by people. But actually, people don't know how should they be judging buildings. They like or hate them based on whether they like the form, colors, shape, lighting, etc which really is the superficial stuff that an Architect has in his/her mind. The Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, for example are not even 'Architectures'. They are sculpture and structure respectively. Architecture is more than 'pretty thing to look at' objects. Architecture is experienced, used and lived, not just looked. What should an Architect be doing?You see, a civil engineer designs walls, floors, columns and beams. They need to ensure that the building envelope stands and is safe over a period of time. To them, a building is a system, a structure that needs to be firm and stable. An architect designs space. If cement, sand, metal and bricks are raw materials for a Civil Engineer, 'Space' is the raw material for an architect. We try creating places from spaces (Ashris Choudhury's answer to What is difference between 'space' and 'place' in architecture? Can we make a space into place? ) that people enjoy to live in. The architect prioritizes what the user 'needs': so while an architect designing a residence will value 'comfort', a museum/memorial design will try to get 'awe', 'fascination' evoked in the space, and in a mall design, architect will have 'ambiance' and 'functionality' in mind. Its these 'core' values that the space evokes is what the 'soul' of the design is.A good design can mold its users into happy and efficient people, while bad Architecture can make people stressed, unhappy and unfocused. http://www.theguardian.com/susta... For example, if a bad architect would design an office, they would do it very easily by designating spaces after they decide the column structure. They would 'allocate' spaces area wise around a central space and have toilets around the corner and be done. This is a poorly 'Architectured' space which sadly most conventional offices are. Such spaces don't encourage conversations and openness. Humans are treated like machines as if all they need is an 'allotted' chamber because we assume everybody wants 'privacy'. People start feeling alienated, bored and less efficient. A good office understands how important good architecture is, to make the space livelier and people more efficient.  With this in mind, here's my pick for 'Architect-ured spaces I like'. I will be picking these buildings 'category-wise' because there is no end to good designs. 1. Holocaust Memorial Museum, BerlinMemorial | MuseumI speak for this space because I have personally experienced how powerfully architectural design can be used as a narrative to simulate experience. The non uniform blocks symbolizing graves through which the museum is entered offer a subtle context to the space. The blocks grow in size as you pass through them making the overwhelming sense of claustrophobia grow as you reach the entrance. The museum is experienced through an audio-guide using microphones that narrates the incidents of the Holocaust, personalizing stories from the victims of Auschwitz. The use of lighting is done excellently to simulate depression, hope, pain and joy in the spaces. Visitors are left teary eyed and full of emotions as they leave the space with deep sympathies and connection with the victims of Holocaust. The museum achieves its objective perfectly and this remains to me, the best Architectured Space that I have visited. 2. Bahai Temple (Lotus Temple), New DelhiReligiousThe space like many temples is designed to create the awe and amazement that a religious space is supposed to evoke. But unlike most temples, where Art dominates over Architecture through sculptures and paintings, the Lotus Temple has a very contemporary design, freeing itself from the semantic grammar of all other religions, which it was precisely designed to do so: create a new 'style' for the Baha'i religion. Its scale, symmetry, surreal ambiance and its landscaping makes it one of the best religious spaces, architecture-wise.3. Fallingwater, PennsylvaniaResidenceFallingwater by Architect Frank Lloyd Wright remains one of the most classic examples of 'Good Architecture'. The house has water flowing right underneath it, blending the space with the nature and merging landscape and built environment together. The natural materials makes the space comforting and relaxing.4. Google Office(s)OfficeGoogle believes in the power of Design as it is evident through the very comforting and inspiring they have in their offices that invigorates creativity and counters stress. Informal spaces are shown to reduce boredom and enhance productivity in workplaces.5. Menara Airport | Mumbai AirportAirportsMumbai:-Airports are mega-systems. They require efficient circulation of people, goods, security, management, and scheduling. Apart from this, Airports also are cultural icons of a country. The first impression an international visitor makes of a country is from the Airport. So, judging by the ability to create an unique impression, I'd pick Mumbai and Menara Airports for the sheer brilliance of fusing contemporary and traditional elements into the design. While Menara Airport displays the fine Islamic jali into the design that creates gives the space a very mosque-like ambiance, Mumbai Airport has Indian elements inspired from peacocks and Indian mandalas. Both spaces create a unique impression.6. Grillagh Water House by Patrick BradleyInnovationThis is a personal favorite. This building is made up of four stacked shipping containers. The entire project is a statement of bravery and confidence of the Architect to convert an already beautiful landscape into a residence for himself using shipping containers, a rather poor choice of material as what some might remark.Here's an overall documentation of how it was done that I'd recommend to any architecture fan. 7. Indian Institute of Management, AhmedabadEducationalThe old campus of IIM Ahmedabad is an architectural masterpiece by Louis I. Kahn. The architect used local material in the design which is a homage to Indian vernacular architecture. The voids created in the overpowering brick mass are purely geometrical and form as cooling vents for the entire structure. Also, they act as interaction spaces for the students. There is ample consideration to lighten up the space naturally and ventilate it as well. Kahn's visionary design along with a group of ambitious industrialists has today made the institute one of the most elite, influential and sought after Business Schools in the world. 8. Jawahar Kala Kendra, JaipurArt CenterThe Kalakendra by Late Ar. Charles Correa is a standing example of sophisticated Architecture that is deeply spiritual and humane. The plan was prepared by the noted architect Charles Correa in 1986 and the building was ready in 1991. The plan is inspired by the original city plan of Jaipur, consisting of nine squares with central square left open. The Jawahar Kala Kendra adapts and applies concepts from ancient architectural principles called the Vastu Vidya. I personally like the space for its embodiment of local culture, materials and style of architecture.Conclusion:This is, by no means a comprehensive list or even an unbiased one, for I have just scratched the surface and this list is very personal, limited to my knowledge. However, my purpose was not to enlist many buildings but explain how 'Good Architecture' is not millions of dollars pooled together to create shiny boxes of concrete and glass like its being done in Dubai now, but a celebration of human spirit, creativity and innovation. The very premise why Architecture departed from pure 'Engineering' was because it promised to stay humane and not treat buildings as machines to be repaired or configured but spaces to feel and live. While I appreciate the influx of Computational Design, Parametric Architecture, BIM Integrated Construction Project Management, and Sustainable Green Building Technology; Architecture, in my opinion, needs to preserve its core values that it started with.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Thank you for the A2A :)Beware, I write long answers.Lets agree on the fact that merely using a software is not what 'fusing Computer Science into Architecture'  is. If that would be the case, Architecture as it is practiced would already have combined Computer Science, as it uses CAD, BIM and modelling softwares.The fields I have in mind are non-existent. Hence it will be difficult for me to pen down links. These are ideas we need to work on. 1. Home AutomationAutomation is the field of making machines do the repetitive things for you. We do tons of things in homes that are repetitive. Say, opening doors, unwinding curtains, switching on fan, turning off lights, etc. Can we somehow make our homes smarter by automating these things? Phillips has recently come with the idea of 'Intelligent Lighting' where you control the lights in your home using a mobile application. Maybe using a similar 'control device' like a mobile app, most of the things can be automated. Even better, we can do away with the control devices. The room can sense if a person is in it and turn on or off the lights, and how much, based on what time of the day it is. The room can analyse your motion patterns and predict your mood, based on which it can control the ambiance. This is an application of Electronics, yes. But the core idea behind it is Computer Science.2. Space OptimizationSince space is such a limited resource these days, space needs to be used with highest efficiency without compromising the functionality. Maybe walls can move to collapse the kitchen into a cabinet when you don't need it and increase the bedroom; Bedroom can shrink to make a larger living space, etc. But I still would regard it as 'Home Automation'. I am referring to optimizing space in the design phase here. It gives you an option to mathematically control apparent 'qualitative' aspects like 'way-finding', 'security' (based on how isolated a space is), 'openness', 'centrality', etc.Hence, architects need 'space syntax' tools. Space syntax is a field that tries to study the properties of spatial configurations quantitatively. A personal note that I have worked in the field briefly in a conference at Hong Kong and further at ETH Zurich, where my professor had been working to develop a software that generates sequence of floor plans with varying arrangements of spaces whose area is defined. The architect can then choose which floor plan can be best suited based on qualitative aspects.3. Virtual Reality VisualizationCan architects experience the design process in the very stage of designing? I don't mean 3D walkthroughs, bleh. I am referring to actually 'experience' the space. With tools like OculusVR, it is possible to experience virtual spaces. If architects can directly walk into the space they design, physically turn around their heads, take a close look at the texture of the materials they use, would that not give them a much stronger control of the design? Even the clients would love to see their buildings even before they are built. Wouldn't that be cool?4. Performance controlIf you treat building like a machine that consumes energy, computer science can be the tool by which you optimize its performance. Although there are tools like Ecotect and Climate Consultant to do this, but they do it rather vaguely. Stronger concepts of physics like Computational Fluid Dynamics, Acoustic Performance, Heat Transfer Simulations are still unused by architects, most of them, at least. If someone can make a framework that uses concepts from physics to run a simulation in reasonable time, he'd/she'd be doing something amazing. Remember, even Ecotect started as a tool made by a PhD student for his research, and with a research scarce field like Architecture, making tools is not impossible for amateurs.5. ScriptingIf you have asked this question, I presume you know about the Rhino+Grasshopper environment. It lets you design using parameters that can be controlled and hence the design can be changed at any point of time, which in theory, gives you better control. Well, what exactly happens is that Grasshopper acts as an overlay graphical way of 'scripting'. Scripting is almost the same as coding and programming (They are not synonymous terms though) that helps you control your design in the virtual environment. Softwares have a scripting language of their own through which you can 'hack' it and bypass the default working. You can make softwares do more complex and custom methods. For example, SketchUp plugins are made in Ruby, Rhino has RhinoScript, Grasshopper plugins are made in C# and it provides an option to automate things with Python, 3Ds has MaxScript and so on.I hope this helped. But what I really think Architecture can learn from Computer Science is how to grow. Today, a group of my friends have started a startup to make Android Apps, another bunch makes websites and some have also learnt iOS programming. The beauty of Computer Science is Open Source today. A community that encourages learning and experimenting. Resources are available online for free. Today, some code developed in France can be used in India and vice versa to build cool things.This is why CS is growing the way it is. If Architecture is to pick up anything, it should accept to be a more friendlier field where the subject is not a monopoly of the masters but a field open to research and experimentation. The sad fact is that the industry is so obsessed with buildings and real estate that we have lost the fun of making spaces, innovation, bringing technology, solve multitudes of problems, designing more intelligently. Students are restricted to learn CAD and Revit and not explore 'designing' beyond that. There is no Architecture Firm in the likes of Google that can be termed as the torch bearer of the field, that hosts free courses for students to learn, new research to flourish and innovations to be possible. Excessive importance is laid on renders and Photoshop. It is now a corporate industry that believes in making money. Architecture as an intellectual field of research is dead. If at all anything, Architecture should get some elixir from CS to get the grey cells running. But having said that, CS is and always will be a tool. It should not be thought of replacing creativity altogether. It should refine our process in a better way.I hope I didn't sound very preachy but the topic is of keen interest to me and concerns me as a student of the beautiful, yet mistreated field.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Its damaging.I was a fat kid in India. At the age of 10, I weighed 40 kgs. The memories I had as a kid aren't something I like to cherish. I was called names in my school, 'mota', 'hippo', 'elephant'. It was mentally damaging to be judged and being called names by people who have just met you. It was very easy to get hurt. I didn't make friends.The fellow students I had in class would get so much fun calling me names, abusing me and making me cry.I hated visiting family celebrations. Close relatives on the very instant looking me would go 'You have turned so huge!' 'You will not grow tall' 'What do you eat?' 'Give me some of that fat, I also want to become fat'Sad thing is, I remember every thing I heard from people even now. My first cousin had remarked 'Only face saver is that you aren't dark, else you would be hideous'I was remarked on lunch 'Look at your shape, try eating a bit less'. I am sure he meant it as a concern, but to me it seemed like blows, slaps and lashes.To a child, these statements become poison, demeaning his self worth. I got so conscious with my body image at an age when I should have been happy.I would return home crying because someone somewhere had said something to me. Some teacher, some student somewhere would have commented on my obesity.My mother would tell comforting thinks like 'You will shed that weight with age, its normal for kids to be chubby', but that seemed a lie. A lie, because practically everyone else had a clear opinion 'You are disgusting! FAT!!'I would cry, I couldn't handle all that.I stopped eating. I refused to have anything that had any sugar in it. I did  exercise too but I had disrupted my food habits. I skipped breakfast, I didn't have the tiffin my mom made for me to school.I would be hungry till 3 pm and have barely anything in lunch, removing half of anything that was served.I would want to vomit out anything I ate. I would literally torture myself to an alarming level.This went for a year. A year of unhealthy food habit, abuse on my body.It worked though the way I wanted it to. I had lost so much weight, nobody would call me fat then. I was not fat, I was weak.People act surprised, 'What did you do?' 'Is there a medicine you took?' 'You look better'I noticed that I had more friends now, my 'social standard' apparently went up. Relatives would not make fun of me and see me as a human and not a pile of fat. But it stuck with me, I vomited out intentionally whatever I ate and I stayed hungry till 3. I had become anorexic.Today, 10 years later, I remember these events as if they happened yesterday.I eat well, yes. But it has damaged me in many ways.Physically, I have to take an antacid tablet each day, other wise I get excess acidity.Socially, having being bullied makes you become over protective of yourself. Its harder to bind with people and welcome them into your life.I will never be able to have good relations with my relatives who I remember had made those comments.Been bullied, it offers you strength you never wanted. There are times when I get drawn to be a bully myself, but I hold that back. I never criticize anyone on their physical appearance, for I know, its something beyond your control and what it does to their mental health. Yes, being over weight is not healthy and as an adult, and one must have a healthy body; But, as a kid, I was simply being me.Bullying is always damaging. It hurts and scars the victim for life. It affects them socially, physically and emotionally. Even after healing, the victim carries a shell that makes him less welcoming to new people and friends.Now, I have understood importance of a healthy lifestyle. I eat appropriately and not skip meals. But, I don't think I can undo the mental effects completely. It has pushed me to an inner introversion mode. I use Extroversion as Chandler Bing did, 'as a defense mechanism' to safeguard my vulnerabilities.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Beautiful question.Space is the raw material an architect uses to create Places. 'Space' to a layman is everything beyond Earth. To an architect, 'Space' is anything that hosts 'Design'. Here, 'Design' stands for material that defines the limit of the space. When Design is introduced to a space, the space gets a character of its own. When this character becomes so strongly reinforced in the minds of people, the space transcends into a 'Place'For example, consider Space.1. Lets get Earth into the picture. In fact, a green open part of the Earth.This space has got no character yet. It is perceptually 'one-dimensional'. 2. Lets convert the space to a place. Lets start by adding some landscaping so that there is a context set. Lets add some trees.Now, the space has got some detail. Now, there are terms that can be used such as: 'near the tree', 20m away from the tree, 'height' of the tree. The space is gaining more 'dimensions' or meaning.3. Lets add a cottage in the space near the trees.The space has now started getting a character. The space can be now thought of as a farm house or a rural area.4. Lets reinforce the image we created with some elementsHere, we have reinforced the image of the 'rural countryside'. It looks more welcoming and relaxing now. Through the elements, we are evoking a feeling of comfort in the users. The space clearly has got a personality now, much stronger than what we started with.5. Lets bring people in the picture and make them use the spaceWe see that this image has kids in the background having a bonfire. They are having fun and the space now 'means' something to them. It is detailed and designed. It has got a spatial definition: The area near the trees by the cottage. It also has a personal definition: A cozy farmhouse in the village.The space can now be regarded as 'Place'. It has become an multi-layered entity.There you go. So, is a place basically random things thrown into 'space'? No. A place is more like a system where all components work together to reinforce the character of the space. The components have to be in a harmony and hence, part of the overall 'Design'.Hope that helped.Image Source1) Space Image: Space: Photos and Wallpapers2) Open Green Space: Summer Grassland Landscapes - Green Grassland Widescreen Wallpapers 1440x900 NO.46 Desktop Wallpaper - Wallcoo.net",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Amazing really. It will obviously be a biased answer for my lack of knowledge about our sister IITs, but with all due respect I can make a very safe bet, that when it comes to a sense of belonging and identity, KGP shall be a fore-runner.Well, more like, it has to be so. KGP is made of the right recipe to a rich, active and a thriving college.Simply analyzing the statistics, one can find that KGP has the highest difference between its opening and closing ranks. Well, it is because of the numerous departments(19) we have, which makes KGP very generous when it comes to selection criteria . The sheer diversity this provides us is amazing. We get the best students at academics and also folks who have several other skills too. A true testament to this fact is the huge society(clubs) culture that runs in KGP. It couldn't have possibly thrived for so long if not fueled by bright artists, actors, entrepreneurs, coders, musicians, sportsmen, debaters, and dancers.Generally speaking, we get more or less, a decent distribution of students from all over the nation. WHY?a) It is one of the most prestigious institutes in the nation and being the oldest IIT, it also has a long list of glorious achievements which attracts students from all regions, alike. a) Its easier to get in here compared to the other old IITs because of the sheer number of seats and various courses offered. No IIT can boast of having so varied departments from Aerospace to Agriculture; Architecture to Biotechnology; Cryogenics to Metallurgy.b) Some parents probably feel their wards are safer in a non-metro environment, away from the city hustle.c) Unlike many other cities, West Bengal and KGP in particular is away from any north-south biases. While a North Indian may find Chennai to be too alien a place, and a Tamilian may find Delhi to be one, KGP seems to be right there on the comfort zone. We hence have as many Punjabis as Tamilians and as many Gujaratis as Assamese. The place is neither politically disturbed KGP as it is gives students no other way but to bond together. WHY?IIT Kharagpur: A campus 2100 acres large and surrounded by nothing but villages, semi-urban dwellings, and very few places and none for someone from a city to ""chill out"". While in other IITs, students would be fascinated by the city; here, the residents of Kharagpur are fascinated by IIT. IIT Kharagpur is an island in itself with all happenings, all possible places where one could hang out, chill, roam, play, and practically do anything is within the campus. KGP transforms into a micro-nation where some brainy folks are captured and left to live five years of their lives. a) You naturally get a sense of belonging and pride to be here. Imagine: every place you are at all through your day, its in your institute. You tend to develop the ""My CCD"", ""My Baskin Robins"", ""My Lakeside"" feel which other folks would never get because probably their addas are not within their campuses.b) You have no friend circle outside the campus. All the people you can ever interact while being here are always around you. You actually have no other way but to interact with them and socialize.b) We have developed a lingo of our own. After a stay at KGP, the lingo stays with you and you often confuse your family and friends outside with ""Peace hai"", ""Kya makhaya hai"", ""Arbit funda"", etc. When a fresher gets enlightened by these magic words, he/she feels like he/she is christened to a community. Our celebrations makes us united. Spring Fest, Illumination, Hall Days, Kshitij have helped shape our identity. They become the instruments through which a KGPian identifies himself.c) The hall culture in KGP is fierce, almost intimidating. I won't go in depth but its pretty much like Hogwarts where it becomes an identity of yours. You shouldn't be surprised be you happen to meet an alumnus and he suddenly is excited if you happen to be from the same hall as he did. There is a sense of belonging, a brotherhood you develop by spending all those hours doing hall-activities and participating in intra-hall events.d) Its easy to find someone like yourself in here. Among the 10,000 students, living here in 2 km radius of yours, you are bound to find someone and many more with whom you share a common passion. But most importantly, what connects people here are the same memories we shall all earn here at KGP: You will remember your first day in Hall OP, the long advice your senior gave over the mess table. Maybe how you and your friends came up with a brilliant new start-up idea, the days when you planned a birthday surprise for your friend by the lakeside, the times when you got admitted in BC Roy to fake a medical leave, the first day you go all drunk on the roof-top, the 2.2 round on that cold winter night with your girlfriend, the first time you flunked and your friends cheered you up, the times when you headbanged over the rock performance at SF, or the times you spent in group study with friends in muggu room and ensured nobody studied, the CS tournament over LAN, the elaborate jali made for Illu, the long races on Khoj, the Hang-ons everywhere, the GymK Elections, the Hall Day mess and the mess in mess, the NSS Camp and the Fancy Dress Event on Farewell, the Inter-IIT thrill, the torn shirts in Holi, the new Film in Netaji, the first Department Trip, overnight snacks at Chhedis, the first party at Flavors, wow, the list goes endlessly! These memories tie you up. And these are made every single day here. And that is what KGP is. Endless and Infinite. 10,000 independent lives running parallely, yet all runnng within these 2100 acres, tied up in our own unique culture.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Being a non-vegetarian I would answer this question on the basis of my interaction with my vegetarian friends and their beliefs for justifying their practice of being a vegetarian.The most common reason that vegetarians have to be so is the sympathy and love for animals. They eat plants however on the premise that they do not have a nervous system and hence do not suffer pain. Well, as much as pain as animals would. This is why some consider mushrooms and eggs as vegetables(?), well, suitable for vegetarians. Now, if this is the premise people base their reason on, I don't see why a vegetarian wouldn't be comfortable eating a plant, even if it is a carnivore since well, it is a plant with no nervous system.There will be other people who practice vegetarianism not because of any sympathy or moral beliefs but because of what they think of is the right food. Since plants get their nutrition directly from nature, they are supposed to be better than meat that has secondary nutrition. Such people would have apprehensions if the carnivorous plants are plants in the first place. Since a plant is expected to live by consuming only water, air and soil, a carnivorous plant would not qualify to be a plant. Hence such people, I believe are more likely not to consume them.And the rest practice vegetarianism largely because of religious reasons. Now, I wouldn't comment on their beliefs but they would eat such a plant on the basis of whatever is provided in their religious texts under the section ""Carnivorous plants or sinful plants "" or in the same lines.More realistically, I believe people are more likely not to eat them because they wouldn't be comfortable eating it. Unless a food is consumed by large number of people, individuals would hesitate to experiment, however safe it might be.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"I am afraid you won't get many answers to your question other than sarcastic troll replies.I really doubt if there exists a homophobic atheist or an atheist homophobe.A person who is rational enough not to follow a mass delusion will also see reason in why love is above gender. Such a person wouldn't be disgusted by their child because of his/her religious beliefs or sexuality. They would rather love them for what they are.And a gentleman who is ashamed of his kid because he was born as gay, is also likely to be offended if this kid disbelieves the supreme imaginary creature who told this gentleman that being a homosexual is a greater crime than committing a murder. I won't be surprised if such a person is grossed out if his son turns out to be differently abled.So there are basically just two people: open minded and bigots. The very fact that you ask this question makes me guess that you are a proud member of the latter.Being a parent does not mean that you own your child. There is a certain responsibility you have towards them. I would plead you not to raise a child if you are unable to provide him/her with the independence and liberty to be themselves.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Because they want it to.A devalued currency by no means is an indicator of a weaker economy. Many economies deliberately devalue their currencies to boost their trades.Lets understand it this way: There are two shopkeepers selling the same commodity. One of them sets his price as 100 rupees/item and the other at 80 rupees/item. As a result, the first shop gets 50 customers, but because of the lower prices, more customers, say 100, flock to the second store.Evidently, the second guy got a better profit. However, had he set his price at 2 rupees/item and got 2000 customers; his profit would be less to the first guy.Countries set their value of currency in similar manner. They try maximizing their profits by altering the price. They try maximizing Price x SalesSo, if a lower price gets a higher sale and thus maximizing the revenue, a country would prefer that to an over-valued price discouraging the trade with other countries.P.S: Countries like Zimbabwe are failed economies. They don't want to stay under-valued. Similarly, countries like Kuwait can afford to have such high currencies because their commodity is so unique (oil here) that the customers (other nations) have no other way but to import it from them.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Imagine a cube changing color.There, you are imagining a 4D object. Or imagine an apple on a weighing scale with the weight shooting up. That is a 4D object too. Well, had the apple also been changing colors, it would be a 5D object.There is no reason why you should think a 'dimension' is only a space-time dimension. Any variable associated with an object is a dimension. Let us get that straight. But well, since you say a '4D' object, you are more likely talking about another space dimension which we refer in terms like 1D,2D and 3D.Well, imagine a world where only 2D beings live. They crawl on a plane. There is nothing called 'height'. Its all length and breadth. Now imagine a 3D sphere passing through this plane. What would the people in this world see? They will be able to perceive only that part of the object that intersects with their world, i.e the 2D plane. So as the sphere passes, they will see cross sections of a sphere, i.e a circle appearing from no-where with increasing radius to a maxima and then decreasing to the point it vanishes as the sphere passes through. It will be a weird experience for them. They wouldn't understand what really happened. However, you can probably find it to be a trivial thing: a sphere moving.Similarly, if at all there was a four dimensional object, you cannot visualize 'it' but you can visualize the portions of 'it' that it has intersected with our 3D world. You cannot get the whole perception of the 4D object because we aren't 4D entities in the first place. (None of the above facts are verified yet. The string theory still needs a lot of experimentation to be understood exactly. However, this is roughly what the whole idea of a 'dimension' is, as conceived.)EDIT:I just came across this brilliant video on YouTube that actually shows the intersections of 4D forms in the 3D world. It explains how forms build up on dimensions.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Thanks for the A2A.I haven't completed my 5 years in IIT and hence it will be definitely a farce to claim that I have an answer to your question, as I am in the process of discovery myself. If you subtly replace 'session at IIT KGP in Arch' with 'life', your question becomes 'How do I make most out of life' which is the profound question that philosophers, thinkers, common men and women are looking for, for centuries. They still haven't found the answer. Unfortunately, I have to say the same about this question. Every student in IIT is very different, has his/her own goals, and has to be subjected to different constrains. Its really not possible that what worked for someone will work for you. You will have to build your story, letter by letter. Keeping that in perspective, here are some loose 'guidelines' that I would have advised to my previous self if time traveling was possible:0. Your life's goal is not PlacementsMany people in IIT start off with a very narrow minded approach basing all their actions on maximizing their chances in the Placements.Listen: You will grow up immensely in these 5 years and what will be important to you, will change. You have come here after years of studying and its now time to develop as a human being. Unlike other Departments, you don't have a chance to change your Department, so its okay to not worry about CG as long as it stays decent like 8+1. Discover IIT like a baby: Try EVERYTHING. You have just stepped to 2100 acres of an island inhabited by the smartest kids of the nation and things will be really cool here. You will meet different types of people, clubs that will be made up of folks who share common passions as you. Go for Auditions even if you think you aren't good at them. Eventually you will figure out what appeals to you. Play sports, go for walks around the campus, learn to talk to strangers, start learning new languages, learn a new skill, join the gym, go for running, go to Calcutta for a trip with your friends, try all restaurants. Just one thing: DON'T SIT IDLE IN YOUR ROOM WITH YOUR LAPTOP. You WILL regret it. You will have all the time in the world to play games and be on Facebook later, but the freedom of the First Year time will not return.Quit the societies if you feel you don't enjoy them. You don't owe anyone anything. Don't buy into the societies' claims of 'This will give you exposure and improve your communication skills' if in exchange you are supposed to do donkey work. There will be groups that take in bunch of people just to get cheap labor. Mantra is: Agar achcha nahi lagta, ditch it.2. Make Friends: Making friends is easiest in the first year and gets harder with time. Talk to people, outside your department and outside your states. You will cherish the memories for rest of your life, so ensure that its with people that you will love to be with. ​3. Study Smart:Study subjects that cannot be mugged in a day. These include Mechanics, Mathematics, and Programming and Data Structures. Revise your notes. Even if you spend 10% of time that you spent during your coaching, you will fare well. The course 'Introduction to Architecture' by Prof. Jaydip Barman will become the foundation of architectural understanding. It is a rather profound course that you will refer to for rest of your architectural career. Pay close attention In his class.The course Basic Design 2 in your second semester will require some knowledge beforehand about how technical drawings are made, what plan, elevation, section, etc of basic architectural elements are drawn like. I'd advise you to discuss with a senior to learn about technical drawing beforehand because I honestly feel the course comes with a steep learning curve.Your CGPA in IIT is a cumulative one, i.e the first year grades are always included in your CGPA calculation. Shoot this up and you will enjoy a high CGPA for the rest of your 5 years.4. Get your Arts and Crafts:Many courses in your First Year like 'Graphics and Visual Communication"" and ""Basic Design"" will be very artistic. You should expect lots of time and effort to be invested in these projects. You will have projects like making a Diwali lamp, designing a logo, designing a roof installation, and such seemingly fun projects. The key here is focus on smart work: Do the projects that produce classy results with minimal work. Students waste lots of time making things that become a torture when extends beyond deadlines. I, for example had spent my Diwali in First Year coloring boxes instead of celebrating outside. So, remember to do smart efficient work. It is wise to invest time to plan things well before starting off cluelessly and get lost. Again, this is my way of doing things, you may want to be a perfectionist and invest time in execution, its totally your call.​​My first year assignments that took hours of re-doing, for I had never done anything artistic.5. Talk to your Professors:The teachers who taught me Maths one of the worst teachers I have faced in IIT. They are usually PhD students who have no desire to teach but only parrot out the topics they prepared. Mechanics and PDS(Programming) sometimes go way too fast. It is important that you talk to your Professors and let them know how you feel about the teaching. Don't just assume that 'exam me dekh lenge'.In fact, they are really good people who also like to get feedback from students. They will explain the concepts that are unclear in much detail if you ask them after class. Similarly, for your Archi classes, most of the things you learn in class will be new. So, talk with the professors and ask them questions. Discuss your assignments with them to understand the problem statement clearly before you start. Feel free to tell your professors that you don't like their teaching if you feel so, in person. I have told this and trust me, they take it very maturely and they then make efforts to make you interested.6. Have healthy relations with your Seniors:Feel free to go up to a senior in Archi and introduce yourself and talk to them; they will be glad to talk to you. If they are busy with some work, go on, ask them if its okay to talk, discuss the work, learn something and give your feedback :) Senior-Junior relations in Archi are very cool, so you can be very open with them. You can openly talk about your acad issues, your love interests, issues you have at home, other problems you are facing, without feeling being judged. Each one of them, I am sure will take out their time to answer your questions. But, please don't idol worship anyone here! Treat them as equals, respect them but don't buy in everything a senior says without asking yourself twice if they make sense.Also, ragging is strictly banned in IIT. Nobody can 'rag' you and you have the full liberty to speak out in case someone misbehaves. Your seniors are in no way different than you, and the only difference is that they wrote their IITJEE some years before you. Still, if you face any problem, you can talk to me, drop me a message and I'll take care :) Don't have any worries. And don't be in stress! 7. Get Skilled:Nobody is going to teach you the softwares here and you better learn them quick else you will be in a fix when its time. Its frowned upon in the class to use softwares in first and second year, but I advise to play around with them: Sketchup, Revit, Rhinoceros and Autocad and see how they work. Having said that, to be a good architect, your hand work should be amazing too.​My first 3D model built from scratch on Sketchup :')8. Keep check of Addictions:You will be on your own, away from your parents and nobody will know if you smoke, take alcohol or weed. Yes, nobody will know, for now. But it will make its effects in 5 years and very seriously if you become a slave of your addictions. Personally, I don't think anything in moderation is bad, but become a slave and it will not take time to get your life ruined, that sadly many in IIT have. My 2 cents: Don't do it if someone forces you and you are not okay with it; DON'T compromise your morals because of pressure from your friends or your seniors. If you are morally okay and want to experiment: go ahead keeping in mind that it is an extremely addictive thing and can get your life spoiled if you let it control you. As long as you are the master and the drug the slave, meh, peace hai. Be in a position to quit at will always. At the end of your first year, you should be a happy, ambitious, open minded kid, bustling with energy :)9. Streamline your interests:By the second Year you'll be matured enough to have an idea of what interests you. If you still haven't figured out, its okay :) Have you figured out things you DON'T like? That was the case with me. Its okay to be confused.ln my first year, I had done an internship in an architectural firm in Vizag where I had to do CAD Drawings in AUTOCAD and then model them in Sketchup, a 3D software. It was basically donkey work that I had no fun doing. Since then, I have not done any Firm based internship. Do what you love! Give everything a chance, for reasonable time and if it still seems no fun, ditch.Do you like Photography? Graphic Designing? Do you like research in Acads, something that amazes you? Do you like playing music? Coding pasand hai? Have some idea about these things by now. But don't worry if its still unclear.​That's Debsoc(Debating Society) team. I loved Debating in my first year, to the point that I could call it a 'passion'. I have been to four national tournaments with DebSoc now and they were some of the coolest people I met and learnt from. Its cool to have such a group that you relate with. Being friends with people who share a common passion with you is something that makes your college life a lot more awesome.10. Fall in Love!No, not romance wala love re, we'll address that later.In the figurative sense. Something that makes you lose track of time, rush emotions in your body and steals your sleep :)Say, start an ambitious start-up and work for it, do something for a social cause, take up a responsibility that thrills you. Find something that you love doing, let that be something that bears no importance in resume, and still do it! You will learn a lot in this process.​Smiles Worth Millions is a group started by a group of my seniors in D-Arch, KGP which works for making playgrounds out of scrap tyres for poor children. It is such a novel thing to do, pursued only by their passion. It brings meaning to their lives. On a less noble side, I have been part of this totally stupid and crazy YouTube channel, that I and Tarun, my close friend came up with to make fun videos on IIT Kharagpur. Check that out: Spectecool. It is going to help us in no way in Placements :p But we love doing it and so we do.11. Love?There's no rush. You will have crushes, you will be proposed, you will propose. You will shy away and say nothing. Anything can happen. Just go with the flow and don't over think. Remember, that there is a big difference between crush and true love: Its not worth it to do 'sacrifices' for crushes. But, you will be blinded and you will make mistakes, enjoy that and cherish them. If you feel frustrated that you don't have anyone to fall in a relationship with, don't worry: Its over-rated to have a love life.I cannot address everything under the sky about love here because they have volumes written on this: only thing I'll add: Don't lose yourself in the process of finding love. In a Department as close as Archi, its very much possible that you will find a crush in the same class as yours and seeing them every day for 5 years makes things complicated if things don't go well. So, be matured about this and think wisely. Use those three words very cautiously :)12. Keep in touch with Family:Be in touch with folks from your family. They will wait for your call every single day and sometimes your call will be all they need to cheer up. Share your problems with them and be open with them. Tell them things in general without getting too detailed if they start micro managing your CGPA. My 2 cents: Don't lie to them or keep them in ignorance of important things. You will not be proud of yourself.Archi can be very torturous at time. I have cried out to my parents when I was told 'This design is horrendous' that I had worked for all night. Its okay :) They sometimes are far more experienced and wise about things than we credit them for.13. Build your profile:Now, by the time you are in your third year, you should start excelling in things that you like. Try putting your best in things that you want to achieve. You want to be amazing at Archi: Work on your design portfolio. (Refer to my blog post to see some standard portfolios I recommend) You want an Econ job later: Make contacts, take Econ additionals, study up Finance things and prepare for CAT/CFA and intern in Finance firms. You want to code? Go ahead, find a project online, sites like CodeChef, TopCoder and CodeAcademy and spend hours improving your skills. This phase requires you to work hard, network to get in touch with hot shots in the field of your interest and sweat blood to become the numero uno in your field.​Witworks is an innovation startup that comes from D-Arch alumnus 'Somanth Meher'. He worked in Google after he graduated and he remains to be one of the inspiring people. He didn't build that profile in a day, did he?14. Optimize Optimize Optimize!When you know that you are heading towards your goal, ask yourself if there are distractions in your life that you need to get rid of. You can only pay attention to so many things at once. For example, there is a society that is only taking out your time without adding much to your life and you want to prioritize Archi over it: Quit it. You want to do something in Economics: don't do night outs in Archi to improve your sheets, just make them doable and use the other time to read Finance topics.Don't invest time in something that you don't want to become excellent in. By extension, if you like a subject, ensure you get an A or Ex in it.. If you hate it, its okay, just get done with it (don't fail though!)15. Relax:No CGPA, no commendation from a teacher can compensate for poor health. Don't have an unhealthy lifestyle like skipping breakfast, only taking cigarettes, getting no sleep to complete your Archi assignments: Its the dumbest way of doing Archi which I accept I have done on my own. Optimize and do smart work! Make sure that easiest things are done first and minimum number of deadlines need to be extended. ​Tropi is one of the best at Architecture in my class and he still needs to take a nap when the going gets tough. Its okay to just take a break, you know. P.S Doing so, I endanger my friendship with him :p Sorry Troops.If things still are tough, let it go like Elsa! Its not worth to damage your body to get some extra marks. It is the professor's failure to not inspire you and put your body through this struggle. But in my experience, ALL Professors have been sensitive to your issues and they do listen to you if you ask for more time and less work if your health is concerned. Talk to them, for sure.16. BREAK THE EFFIN RULES!!Not the IIT rules, you'll regret doing so :pBreak the wrong rules that Archi Department has founded that its seniors have blindly followed and make a change with you! Mass Bunk is a common practice in D-Arch. Students abscond a class without informing the professor in a synchrochized manner when there is an agreement in the batch that there is too much pressure. Sounds cool, no?​:p No, it really is very disrespectful to the Professor and harms your relations with them. It piles up work and allows ineffieciency to creep in.Having said that, its the Professors' duty to make sure that students enjoy their subjects. They ahould ensure that the work is doable and students are learning about Design from the work and ita not a dumb copy paste assignment. Some professors who have been mechanically doing their job without connceting with students or making efforts to get them interested are really a dissapointement. I am glad there are not many professors like this now. Most of them are extremely good and you will love their classes. I am institutionalized now, I am part of the 'system' and me speaking to stop Mass Bunks is no less than hypocrisy. But, I really want to see that you guys break this stupid system with your batch.I would want to see you guys not as the 'Last rankers of IIT who are here in the mercy of Archi being a backward department' no no no... You must be the men and women that you wanted to be when you dreamt of becoming IITians. Don't be silent in class, demand of the Professor for the knowledge that you are paying for. Become the individuals who don't follow the crowd like a sheep but make a position in your niche. Mediocrity is a crime. Don't be one mediocre chap.If you are not proud of the person you are when you look in the mirror, apologize to yourself and do what you need to. Dispose of inertia and excel in your work :)This is my story till my Third Year, my 'Rulebook' if I had to make one. I don't know how things are gonna be in the next 2 years to come, but I guess it will be fun to find out. But really, once you get here, you don't need a rule book anymore, you'll know :)Best Wishes.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"All right! This question had been marked as 'Answer Later' for a month and I really wanted to do justice to this question. Now, before I start, I need to mention that the GoT Houses have a lot of inter-personal action going which Departments won't share, obviously. So, a lot is based on the individual traits of the Departments as I perceive.So in a parallel KGP-Westeros universe, we have Dynasties instead of Departments. Each dynasty has a royal occupation that the dynasty follows. Young boys and girls each year try to get into one of them.1. Dynasty of Computer Science and Engineering a.k.a. House Lannister.This House is the richest in the Seven Kingdoms and is very proud of its legacy. They have a rather aristocratic sense of entitlement to the Iron Throne. Every Year, the King's Landing becomes the venue of the Annual Spring Celebrations in KGP-Westeros. They are so concerned with their legacy that they do not let even the best warriors of other Dynasties to get baptized as 'Lannisters' (DynC)2. Dynasty of Mathematics and Computing a.k.a. House TyrellThis house always had best of the resources and has gained added importance after marital alliances with the Lannisters. The Tyrells are manipulative and calculative with apparent desires to conquer the Iron Throne from the Lannisters, initially pretending to be their allies.3. Dynasty of Electronics and Communication Engineering a.k.a House BaratheonThe house believes it is the rightful and deserving heir to the throne that Lannisters have captured. They have believed their legacy remains as a strong House. They are guided by God of Lights, a magical force that makes their art unique and special. They can make huge sacrifices, like societies, sports, food, only daughter, etc for something big like fame, victory, CGPA, Iron Throne and PPO.4. Dynasty of Mechanical Engineering a.k.a House TargareyanThe House once was the unquestioned leader of Westeros. Now, it sits with a large bunch (the largest in Westeros) of Unsullied Army. The House has been liberal with idea of incest and hence has some of the most cracked up leaders who burn down horses for treading on grass. The incest among their own Dynasty has generated 3 parallel sub-dynasties.5. Dynasty of Architecture and Planning a.k.a House MartellThis matriarchal House, ruling Dorne, has been isolated from the rest of Westeros having a unique identity of its own, in its furiously independent style. They choose their warriors after two competitive fights. They are loyal to their own and not to foreign authority. The House is infamous for its notorious plunders, possibly because of their intense internal political struggles. 6. Dynasty of Civil Engineering a.k.a House StarkOnce the conqueror of the Iron Throne, and one of the strongest Houses of Westeros, this House has now lost all its power to foreign dynasties. It has believed itself to be 'The next big thing' for over 10 years now. They are very proud of their honor and are brave warriors looking for an opportunity to jump back. They don't hope to be the conquerors now but be loyal to the lead.7. Dynasty of Electrical Engineering a.k.a House BoltonViolent and Atrocious with their almost psychotic warfare practices, this House is one of the strongest ones now in Westeros looking to establish its conquest. 8. Dynasty of Agriculture and Food Technology a.k.a House GreyjoyThe House ironically has the exact motto as its real Westerosi counterpart -'We do not sow'. They are Iron Borns, and shy away from Farming, apparent from them drifting away from Agriculture in later stages to more resourceful occupations. 9. Dynasty of Humanities and Social Sciences a.k.a House ArrynHappy in their idle vale with peaceful conditions, they don't face the fire of the competition as severely as the other Noble Houses do. It makes it easier for them to have their conquest around their region. 10. White WalkersThe Professors. They give no shit to which Dynasty are you from.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Ego is the biggest enemy of Success, according to me.I can speak for this because I have personally experienced this.A teacher of mine had once remarked that 'Success is a journey and not a destination'. I didn't get what she meant back then. The way I interpret is that, there's no 'level' that is called 'success', but its a state where one continually improves. A person becomes successful by a series of gradual improvements over time.Ego hinders the rate at which these small improvements are made. While 'confidence' reaffirms one's belief in themselves and boosts them up during low times, Ego makes one believe that nobody is better than them and their existing skills are better than the rest. Ego brings reluctance to accept new ideas, no urge to learn new skills, and no need to undo wrong habits within oneself. Egoistic people fail to adapt to new changes since they are so proud of what they are and believe in no room for improvement. This makes them inflexible to change. Worse, 'learning' is perceived as weakness by Egoistic people as it means that there is something lacking in them.Egoistic people lose companions along the way and they are left to tread the way all alone which kinda sucks. The final success is then not worth the toil if there isn't someone to celebrate the success with, someone who was there with you the whole time to witness the growth. Ego distorts one's perception of their strengths and weaknesses. It tends to exaggerate the former and ignore the latter. Hence, the decisions made by egoistic people tend to be made in haste and lack of thought.Ego changes a person. Egoistic people believe that their old habits, friends, and beliefs were 'mediocre' and they need to become more 'exclusive' to maintain their standards. This invites depression and crisis like situation where the person starts questioning if 'Success' is corrupting them. Its not success that is corrupting them, but Ego is.And as a final nail in the coffin, Ego makes you think that you 'deserve' things by default without putting efforts. When the very foundation of success, i.e. 'Effort' is missing, the only way to go is downhill from where one is.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Note: This is a redirected answer from ""Why are IITians so hyped when they are nowhere close to institutes like MIT, Caltech and CMU?""The two statements in the question aren't really linked. IITs are hyped. IITians are nowhere close to MIT, Caltech and CMU. Both need not be mutually exclusive. IITs being hyped.IIT is hyped because it is a brand. It has a market value. Now what is this market? Indian Society: IIT is perceived as a ticket to a successful career. For a middle-class Indian student, it is the perfect platform to attain exposure in a very reasonable cost, subsidized by the Indian Government.Indian Government: How did it begin? Nehru instituted IITs as 'Temples of Indian Learning' which would produce some of the best students who'd be professionals speeding India's transition from a developing nation to a developed one. Hence, a large chunk of funds are allocated to IITs, students are given a large subsidy in tuition fees (70%) and the infrastructure is well developed. It was amended in the constitution to give special powers to IITs by which they don't have to be deemed to a university like other colleges have to.This reasonably attracted students to join in for the immense privileges. The huge demand-supply imbalance insured that each year only the best students in the lot join in. And since the best always joined in, it was natural for the government to regard IITs in a higher light. This two way attraction ensures that IIT brand is maintained and students prefer it;Would BJP in its manifesto have declared ""One IIT in every state"" had there been no ""IIT"" brand?Coaching Institutes: Well, its pretty self-explanatory. Because there is such a demand and Indian parents would give in anything to have their wards study at IITs. To attract more students, they do refine the brand presenting in a brighter light. Alumni: Well, I have to agree that you do see IITians doing stuff, and stuff that is worthy of getting response. More than conditioning at IIT, they achieve success in lives because they always were academically strong. It is usually students from IITs who do well in CAT, IAS, UPSC, SAT, GRE, GMAT and other competitive examinations, so you always believe that IIT is a good stepping stone to a career advancement.There would be other factors too, but these factors are good enough to establish any college as a reputed institute. I really don't think any university enjoys these factors as much as IITs do.This brings me to the second part. Why are IITs valued when MIT, Harvard and Caltech are better than them?1.  Indian Society: There is no point comparing IITs to MIT, Harvard and Caltech. This chunk of the market doesn't really care of who's the best because they can't afford studying there. Proximity to home is a lot more important factor that decides where to study. Even if we assume that the mentioned institutes are a 'lot' better than IITs, the market would prefer the best institute they can afford under a budget.2. Companies: IITians (and in fact, Indians) are cheap labor. We agree to work for a reduced wage having the same qualifications. Also, our qualifications are usually very high because of the natural emphasis our society pays to ""degree"" and education.But the reality is, we aren't much worse than the US Universities.The rankings that you refer to judge which universities are best in the world, uses many criteria which really don't make a sense in our context. ""International Students"", ""Allied fields (Music, Psychology)"", ""International Staff"", ""Research funding"". Well, this is the problem with the nation and not IITs in particular. We don't have any students interested in a Music or a Psychology Major as much as in Engineering and Medical. ""International Staff"" won't come to India because we don't have the comfort that they are used to in India and so on.If you just see the technical output and the relevant fields, we are as good as the Universities in US.So yeah, I guess that's pretty much how it is.How do we beat IITs and get another college/institute to the elite level?  1. Attract best students in the nation. If the best student joining your institute is academically stronger than JEE-Advanced AIR 1, you know that your institute can beat IIT as a brand.2. Get big companies to place your students from your institute. Since education in India is basically an investment to a good salary, better the incentive, better the demand you shall have. Do you remember when Facebook placed two students from IIIT-Allahabad at 60lac/annum?There was a rage among people and most certainly the closing ranks for IIIT-A would have gone much down that year.3. Get other popular brands to endorse you: With Chetan Bhagat's five point someone on IIT-D later becoming an international hit; Huge celebrities arriving in IIT-B's Mood Indigo and IIT-KGP's Spring Fest (College Social Fests), Limca Records being made at Shaastra, IIT-Madras; IITs have got the celebrity status now. Reverse that! Get President of India to your convocation, get big celebs in College Fests, make films like 2 States shoot in your institute.4. Do NOT make an advertisement on your college: (Unless you want to be heavily mocked by) Shaarda and IIPM have become a laughing stock with their claims which of course aren't credible. Has any IIT ever made an advertisement to attract students? Think of better ways of publicity. People will judge you, else.5. Provide cheaper education: Inspite of 70% subsidy in tuition fees by the government and almost 99% for the reserved students, the residual money is still big for poor but talented people to not pursue a good education. If you can provide the IIT-like experience at a much cheaper rate, you shall become the new center point.6. Endorse your Alumni: Manipal would have got a good media coverage and positive impact when Satya Nadella became the CEO of Microsoft. Even IITians were damn jealous of them.7. Give better food in mess: I would quit IIT Kharagpur and join you with no complains at all :)I am sure if you get a campus with these points in mind, you will successfully crush IIT as a brand and no longer will the damn IITs be hyped!",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Nobody is born a criminal, but it is surprisingly easy for a person to become one. Rape is a heinous expression of dominance. A rapist believes that he/she can command dominance over his/her victim by infringing upon their victim's right to have the freedom to decide whom they want to have sex with. The society perceives having sex as 'losing virginity', or losing the right to be called 'pure'. A rapist sees rape as an act of robbing the victim of their purity and dignity.Rape is far more than a physical act. It is driven by the desire to shame the victim and reduce them from a human to an object. Worse, surveyed rapists say that raping a victim gives them a feeling of power and control.And, I have the audacity to say that the society we live in, very casually promotes this mentality in a seemingly harmless manner. The society evolves boys into believing that they are not men enough unless they can have sex or show dominance over women.The society encourages women to be submissive and any form of raising voice against the patriarchy is seen as being immoral. Any attempt to exercise an action condoned for boys like dating, having multiple partners, and having voluntary sex is labelled as being a 'slut'.As a young boy, the child sees the father scolding the child's mother, the mother being silent when she is hit,he gets this idea that 'Yes, girls are meant to be silent and a guy can beat her up, its normal.'When he grows up and sees the actress in movies trying to flirt with the boy and dressing slutty to seduce him, he thinks 'Yeah, women are physical objects for me to play. Its normal'He enters college and his friends are like 'Dude! You are friend zoned! There is no way you are gonna get laid'He thinks 'The only reason a guy should be friends with a girl is to have sex and nothing more. His friendship is a service for which he should be getting sex as a salary'The casual 'Don't cry, you are a man', 'Are you a girl, smoke a cig, man!''You are not a man, you don't watch porn', 'You don't jerk off? What are you, gay?' these add the final blow in the innocent mind and make it a sexist one.And then when, this guy becomes a rapist, its seen with shock.A woman on the other hand is taught to make sacrifices for the man.'he is your brother, give your share to him.' 'Hush! , You are a girl, speak slow'. I know, many girls are assholes too, so am not trying to be the blind male hating feminist here, its just that boys are spared for the same degree of assholery that a girl is termed slut at.The society is at fault here. Our boys need to be nurtured better, our girls need to be empowered. Rape happens as a result of our degraded values and morals, male ego and inequality in terms of gender roles. Anyone can be a rapist. Your best friend, your uncle, your relative.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Its a wrong assumption that we should be happy all the time.People stay in abusive relationships even when they gain no happiness out of them, people are willing to die for their country, choosing to work in a stressful situation, watching horror and tragic movies are some of the things I can think of where people voluntarily choose against happiness.Every human needs a combination of all experiences and emotions to feel full. The fundamental ones like Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear and also the finer ones like Anxiety, Nostalgia, Contemplation, and Embarrassment. All these emotions help us feel alive, since being in one emotion is boring and actually- 'unhealthy'. I understand that it is counter intuitive. But see it this waySadness helps you vent out your negative thoughts and acts as a call for help to your surroundings.Anger makes you take action about things that bother you.Disgust makes you aware of things that make you uncomfortable and hence let you make better options.Fear makes us warned of dangers and helps us stay away from dangers.Nostalgia makes us rooted to our memories and attached to our loved ones.Contemplation makes us ponder over our decisions and make less mistakes.Stress makes you aware of urgency and pumps adrenaline to tackle situations.Our minds are complex system of emotions and we need to use them in effective directed ways to use them in our favor. For example, Anger makes you take action against wrongs in the society, sadness makes you empathize for people, Fear keeps you from killing yourself.Imagine if everyone was happy all the time, the world would be a disaster. People would not care about someone stealing, killing or hurting others for 'happiness' because they don't feel sad, angry or infuriated anymore.As said, it is healthy to embrace emotions and channelize them effectively and it is unhealthy to ignore them and pretend that they don't exist or forcefully try to be 'happy' all the time. Emotions need to be trained and practiced to obey you. They are there to help you. Embrace them.(I'll recommend watching the movie Inside Out to get a picture of how elegantly emotions work as a team in our minds to help us. Its a beautiful piece of art and research)",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"My desperate attempts at learning both the languages probably make it possible for me to shed some light on this.Here are some of the parameters that may help you decide.LOCATION: Well, am sure that number of speakers of each language is not a huge incentive for learning a language, although, still is a significant one. What matters is however, how diversified a language is.The map showing the nations where Spanish is spoken.French speaking nationsWell so as you see, there are specific regions where each of the language dominates. You should decide if you have an inclination towards a particular region, like a dream destination, a probable place of work, possible job opportunities etc. In Western Europe, French is spoken in more number of countries: France, Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, etc whereas Spanish is spoken just in Spain. In America, Spanish dominates Latin America and is spoken in Mexico. French is spoken in Canada and in northern Africa.NATIVE LANGUAGE: One can choose a language over the another simply because it is easier to speak. French and Spanish are both Romantic Languages (Direct links from Latin) and share a common vocabulary. However, the pronunciation is very very different. French requires you to be very specific in pronunciation. English and French do not share a common phonetic base. Spanish is easier both in pronunciation and spellings for an average English speaker. Again, if you are an Italian or Portuguese, Spanish will sound more familiar to you. As an Indian, I found it easier to pronounce Spanish as it shares a common phonetic base with Indian languages. French has lot of sounds which require you to use your mouth which is absent in Indian languages. So, how close your language is to both will give you an idea of how easily can you grasp it.CHIC FACTOR: Well, face it, we do learn languages because of the appeal they carry or how classy they sound. French has a higher appeal compared to Spanish. French has been associated with the language of love and class. Several books on arts, architecture, history, etc have been written only in French. So learning French will unlock this whole dimension. Spanish lovers however consider French to be unmanly and too feminine. Spanish doesn't enjoy the status of a classy language as French does though.Well, so basically its you who gets to decide the language that matches with the frequency of your tone. There are other parameters as well, but then: More the languages, more the fun. Why don't you screw all these reasons and try learning both the languages and see which one is more fun. After all, language learning should be fun and not a thought provoking brainstorming activity. Au Revoir y Adios!",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Michael Sandel, professor of political philosophy at Harvard University in his lecture series on Justice has explained the ""ethics"" in economy quite well.You ask that there are very well off individuals making tons of money while several others suffer from poverty and pain. Does it mean we take all the money of the wealthy ones and distribute it among the less fortunate?Sandel argues that such a system would be counter-productive as this will make a two way harm. The hard working individuals who can make lot of wealth will now have no incentive to work harder as they won't earn as much as they work. Also, by distributing free wealth to disadvantaged people, many would get lazy and have no incentive to work as they would earn anyway.There are three views that have evolved over the times to reach to a conclusion as to what ethically does a person deserve from what he earns. I'll briefly explain these views.Libertarian view of justice argues for a free market system. It argues that jobs are open to be taken up by anyone who is qualified to do them and shall put in their hard work to do so. In such a scenario, the talented and hard working individuals rightfully deserve all the wealth that they earn.However, is that fair?Sandel denies saying that such a system of distribution isn't fair because in such a scenario, people with an affluent background will get an unfair advantage. Individuals who happen to be fortunate to have good education and the required qualifications have so, only because of accident by birth. Such a distribution of resources would only be unfair who are disadvantaged by accident of birth.Meritocratic view:This view argues for fair equality of opportunity. Providing everyone with fair rights to excel is what meritocratic individuals believe. Everybody should be starting from the same start line. But then, Sandel argues, who is going to win in such a case? The fastest runners are. And do you think a runner is fast enough only because of the efforts that he or she put? No, even the ability to put in required effort is a privilege you earn by the accident of birth. You can run fast because you got the necessary environment which others didn't. This view assumes that everyone was brought up in a fair, equal world which is far from reality.The unfairness of this system is tried to be corrected by the Egalitarian view.People may gain or benefit from their good fortune, but only under the condition that the least well off are benefited by that.This in simplistic terms means that, as long as their is a taxation to your income that goes for the welfare of the less well-off, the remaining income of yours is rightfully deserved by you. This does not take away the whole incentive to work as the tax percentage is adjusted in such a manner that too disproportionate distribution is avoided.A logical rebuttal to the Egalitarian view would be ""Why should I be paying my money which I own to the government against my will? Isn't it something I own? Isn't government committing a theft?""Sandel explains that while we enjoy fundamental rights of freedom, speech, and dignity, we do not own ourselves of what we earn entirely. We owe a lot of what we have been able to earn to the society and hence we need to contribute to its welfare. It is not the violation of one's right but a moral duty one has taken up by the contract of entering into the social fabric.I believe that this is a convincing view of what makes earning money ethical.

Ashris-Choudhury,"Consider a train journey. You are all alone and surrounded by a crowd of people. There is a toddler accompanied by his father who is bawling at the top of his voice. You do not react initially. The kid, however never stops. He goes from crying to shreiking and shouting at the top of his voice. The father stands next to him making no effort to console him. You shall then, of course start juding him. After a while, people are so irritatated that you approach the father and ask sternly to make the child calm. You are firm and quite understandably, mad at the child and also the father.The father is expressionless and appears blank. He looks at you and replies, ""I have already tried everything. We are just returning from the funeral of my wife who was bed-ridden for a month. The child is deeply moved. If you can, please try to calm him down. All my efforts have gone into vain"".What would be your reaction, then? Would it be filled with anger and irritation like it was a moment before? Certainly, not. Within an instant, all your beliefs take a total 180 degree flip. You feel sorry for them and the cry no longer appears irritable to you.This, is paradigm shift. Well, although not exactly the way the example illustrates but the essential idea behind it is the same.

Ashris-Choudhury,"Time is what life is made up of. Time is the currency in which relationship stocks are bought. Relationships are glued when you pour out time from your lives and procure memories in exchange. Now, these memories may be good or bad, but in any case you need to buy these memories with time from your life.I do not know if it applies to everyone but I bind with people when I share memories with them, both happy and good, and mostly good. This implies that I have shared most time with them.Some relatives like your parents, your brothers and sisters, grandparents usually stay around longer than your other relatives and hence they will be most important people in your lives because your life has been mostly constructed with the times from their lives.This also applies to your best friends: the ones who were with you since kindergarten, who helped you in difficult times, who were you all around and you have memories with them. It also gives them the same status as your close relatives.I don't have the power to stay in touch or make relationships with people who I can' share much time with. Hence, all far relatives who I occasionally meet maybe once in 2 years, 'friends' with whom my conversations don't exceed more than the usual 'Hello, ssup?' aren't as important as my close ones simply because I haven't invested enough time in them.Time Invested hence is a rough indicator of how important is someone in your life. But of course, its 'rough', what is a real parameter is the memories you hold in exchange for that time. And this Memory Returned/Time Invested is different for different people, but is usually highest for parents, your lovers, your children, your siblings and your best friends simply because the memory returned is so damn good.And since you have spent the maximum time with yourself, technically you are the most important person to yourself, making Virali's and Anon's answer perfect.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"I regret nobody has ever ridiculed me for my name, for I have no stories to tell. But being honest to the question, I had to answer this. My name has no meaning. Narcissist googling has made me known that there isn't a single person on planet Earth who shares my name. Well that's kinda cool though. My name is the result of my Dad's creativity when he decided to fuse the initial syllables of his name and his brothers' which he interprets to be a fusion of their blessings.

As long as it doesn't hurt your values, its okay at times to pretend to agree with the other person if doing otherwise would cost both of you to have an argument and a sour fight.Yes, but when someone goes against basic human principles and tries to curtail someone's rights and imposes their beliefs on others using religion as an excuse, things are different. If someone says ""Homosexuality is wrong because its against God's Laws"", ""She is menstruating, she cannot visit temple as she is impure"", ""My God is better than yours"", they better be prepared for a real bad-ass speech from me, doesn't matter if its a close friend or relative.So, yes: I pretend to be religious when it doesn't compromise with some of my fundamental values which includes not to be an irrational dumb-ass.

Ashris-Choudhury,"RamaLord Shri Ram is an Indian mythological character who is considered to be the ideal man in Indian culture (Maryada-purushottam). People look up to him and his stories are supposed to guide people in path of truth, righteousness and similar sounding terms.Mythological stories have always been good bedtime stories. But when you really think about the message they try to send, its scary. It is weird how the entire Indian society is obsessed with a character who would be far from a role model in today's context.I don't see how anybody can justify something called Agneepariksha. Rama essentially wanted his pregnant wife to prove her 'purity' by crossing through fire. Well, not commenting on how illogical that is, this character who did what not to get his lady back, doubts her sanctity. Just because she was kidnapped he doubted the paternity of his unborn child.And what is more sad is that Sita here acts as this submissive lady who is supposed to be loyal and truthful and follows her husband without questioning. Now, isn't this a fundamentally sexist example set here?Rama gave up his empire because his father had promised his wife Kaikeyi to make her son the king. Now, he goes beyond all extents, gets himself exiled for 14 years, gets his wife and brother too exiled. Even his father at the end tells him not to do so, following which he dies in grief. Rama leaves his entire empire and his family because he wanted to uphold that promise. I find that stupid and illogical. Maybe as a story, this was just a part of the plot. Had Rama been any normal character in a plot, I would consider his conception as a nice grayish character developed by the author (poet in this case) torn between family and state. Makes a good soap opera plot.However, when you idolize this guy and when I see my folks, my parents worshipping him and bowing down to him, offering him thousands of bucks, touching his feet, and serving his idol sweets, I wonder why. I would rather do that with Spiderman, say.His wife also seems to be a weak lady, too weak and happy to be seen as an item owned by Rama.

Ashris-Choudhury,"English, Spanish, French and Arabic.Mandarin Chinese will be a waste of time unless you are planning to reside in China and have a talk with all of its 1.5 billion population. I comprehend that you want to optimize your(people you can have a talk with/time devoted to learn languages)ratio. But what you are totally ignoring here is the distribution of speakers. You will truly experience the power of learning poly-languages when you can talk to most people wherever you go, not when you go to a specific location where the language is in majority.Its like this: there are 5 islands with population: 200, 200, 200, 200, 1000. The first four speak one language and the fifth speaks another.Well, as you can see it makes more sense to learn the former language if you want to explore diversity, visit many places, see many cultures. The latter while having a larger population is just one niche of people with same culture.Anyway, even when you do visit the latter island, you wouldn't talk to all 1000 people, will you?So, similar is the case with Mandarin and even Hindi! Nobody speaks these languages save Chinese and Indians and a small fraction of other countries around. It really isn't worthwhile learning them unless you are on a long trip to either India or China, from a totally utilitarian view.But yeah, English and Spanish are pretty diverse. Only these two languages will unlock North and South Americas, sizeable portions of Africa, Asia and Europe.To acquire more diversity, I'd recommend Arabic and French. These two would additionally unlock the entire Middle East, parts of Canada, chunks of Africa, sizeable Europe more.I'll soon update a map with the info graphics, but I can guess by intuition that a large area will be linguistically unlocked if you grasp English, Spanish, French and Arabic.If you conquer Mandarin, Hindi and Russian later, almost 80% of the planet will be accessible to you.Its hard however to master Africa, India and Europe since languages change every few hundred miles. But nevertheless, yeah, with these 6 languages, an array of several related languages like Italian, Urdu, Portuguese, Punjabi, etc will automatically open.It is a steep learning curve. It gets easier exponentially! The initial slope is high :) All the best!",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"A friend of mine lost her phone recently. Well, it was a disaster.She had no app installed for the tracking purpose and the phone wasn't locked.Since it was an Android phone, we could get the IMEI number from the Google account.Now ideally, using the IMEI number, the police should be able to track your phone. Probably the ones we had around never knew anything like that existed.All we could do is remotely disable the sim card. There are tracking sites on the web which track the phone (Android's Find my location) but the phone had to be switched on for that.My thorough research on Android phones made me conclude that its really difficult to track down your phone once lost using any app, sheerly because they depend on so many iffs.Iffs like if the phone is on, the GPS is on, if its connected to internet.. A thief would have to be really stupid to fall for that.There are apps which trigger a SMS with the last location detected if the sim is changed.Well I had a pretty bad experience. We didn't find the phone though but we could lock the sim to avoid misuse.There are apps to protect your memory from violation of sensitive information, you can try them.Only if we knew this a month before the phone was lost.All the best with finding yours/ getting the right apps to avoid a theft in future.",high,high,high,mid,low

I would call a space special to me when it becomes a part of me, part of my memories and fills me with joy, nostalgia and cheer fullness. These are certainly not places you would find photogenic or surreal, just places that are dear to me and would be etched in my memories.1. Hall 5, Central Library: This is like a special part of the library where you find books on architecture, poetry, languages and philosophy. At times I feel like spending my entire day here, lost in those books, fascinated just by looking at the sheer volume of awesomeness.2. Lakeside: Some beautiful memories, birthday celebrations, near death experience and solitary moments staring at the fishes in the lake. There were days when I came, just sat there on the bench and talked to myself, noticing the small details happening around. There is something so happy and nice about that place, it makes you forget bitter memories.3. The long road around the IIT campus: Sheer beauty in the morning. Greenery floods your eyes and the winds striking against your face is plain ecstasy. You can truly appreciate how amazing the architecture of LBS looks from all angles! It is a clear road to ride your cycle with full speed, no hands on the handle and scream aloud.4. RDC, Old Architecture Department: This spooky place, deserted by any living soul is perfect place to be walking alone on a winter night. The right kind of setting for a crazy adventure. PS (Rumors of it being haunted make it even more exciting to explore)5. GymK top: One of the less explored places of the insti. Nothing like laying down on the slopy roof and watching the early sun rise in the morning. Its a view one can only expect in hills and mountains.6. The lane to the left (to the water tank) from the main road that goes to Prembazar: This lane which apparently has the building where bombs were kept during Independence times leads to old staff residencies and open fields. Nothing like cycling through this pitch dark lanes at 3 in the night. You will notice how beautiful VSRC looks at night.I don't think most of these places are happy places or are even popular.

Ashris-Choudhury,"Please be explicit in your questions that you appreciate answers only from people of a specific region rather than excluding an entire community, which honestly seems too rude on your part.Well, I ponder over the probable reasons for your discomfort. I believe its a two way thing why this happens:I) As a person from West, you probably cannot relate with the perceptions that Indians have evolved. We might come off as pretty loud by Western standards, but beyond those superficialities, I see that we have pretty much similar responses.II) We have well adapted to your lifestyles. People in Indian cities are no strangers to American sitcoms, American Politics or even Hollywood affairs. We can relate with many questions you claim to be ""yours"". So while many India centric questions seem totally unrelated to you, we do not face any such biases. I am comfortable with questions with all genres.I guess with a sizeable population like ours, you cannot really keep us totally away.

Ashris-Choudhury,"I genuinely like this question, for it seems to me that you're really curious. These are the things that hover in my mind quite often, so I can relate totally. I pondered over this for a while and this is what I think:We don't have fixed personalities, they are flexible. We adapt to situations and we are different people in different environment. India is a funny place. You have a slum right next to a five-star hotel. These are the two extremities in which we Indians thrive and it generates an interesting spectrum of personalities in us.Well, the same person who'd fight for free dhaniya(coriander) with his well bargained grocery wouldn't mind paying 200 bucks for a coffee at CCD. We'd refrain from paying five rupees to a beggar but will have no hesitation tipping a waiter. We speak like benighted people with our servants and deliver our most sophisticated accent when we talk to someone well-off. The same clothing at a footpath store when sold in an air-conditioned mall can be sold at four times its value at the former place, we have no problems. This is how we are. We live in a spectrum. On one end, we are this jugaad (Bodge) person on one end, inherently Indian, desi and on the other we are the well sophisticated, pseudo-western creatures on the other.There, I made some info-graphic too :)So, yup. Each one of us has their own spectrum. A person who has always lived in a city will probably have only the red end of the personalities. Someone who has probably seen his/her family go up from lower class to upper-middle will encounter the entire spectrum. :p So much with the theorizing!We associate different activities with this band and adapt to that personality accordingly. Buying groceries is a blue task, going to a luxury restaurant is a red job and we are behaving accordingly. I would say, your neighbor associates owning a pet dog as a yellowish orange task. Speaking in Kannada/your native tone is well off in the bluish zone. To abide by this universal theory (that I just cooked up) he should hence red shift (sorry!), close to the red band and upgrade to speaking in English which is probably also yellowish.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"No. I believe any such entity is not likely to be true. The supernatural powers that you refer to are1. Supposed to exist after their primary body(I don't know what to term this as) is dead.2.Have consciousness of their life events.3. Do stuff such as scare people, kill them and other theatrical performances.Let me explain what do I think of all the three points.3. To do stuff, you need to expend power or essentially use energy. These entities are supposed to walk and do stuff on the planet earth. Planet earth moves around the sun and rotates around its axis, i.e, it is constantly moving. So how do these entities stay on earth? Are they pulled by gravity too? Or do they calculate the speed and direction and go accordingly every second? More likely to be the former. In order to be attracted by gravity they should have mass. So, they should obviously leave footprints wherever they go. In the extension, if they fly or do anything for example, they are doing work against gravity. So, they are expending energy. If they themselves are energy, they would be depleted and there would be no ghosts. Hence ghosts wouldn't be much useful.2. Now how do they remember stuff from their lifetime? All the information is stored in the brain which unfortunately is burnt or buried. So how does this soul access the information? The human information is supposed to be electrochemical in nature transmitted by sodium and potassium ions. So how does this entity have consciousness?1. Well, this is open for philosophical and spiritual explanations. This belief is actually a concept or definition and cannot be refuted. However we have disproved the consequences of this assumption and on those basis, this should be disproved.So, from my side all I would say is, enjoy your show and fear not.

Ashris-Choudhury,"Let me try to address the question on the basis of logical intuition.The transition from: (2010) Red for the dislike bar and Green for the likes:To 2013: Just green for the likes.To as you pointed out: TodayBlue for the likes.I guess, traditionally, we have associated the green-red combination with Correct vs Incorrect. Red symbolizes danger and warning. We see red labels on harmful and hazardous products. It creates an immediate sense of alert and tension. Associating ""Red"" with disliking a video probably was just too harsh. It was like a big repelling warning saying ""THIS IS A BAD, TERRIBLE VIDEO! GET AWAY!"". Arguably, YouTube could have possibly lost millions of views because the users were simply repelled by the RED WARNING! on a video.And well, YouTube users are infamous for being very impulsive and judgemental. My experience suggests that most of the ""GAY!"" or ""EPIC FAIL!!"" or ""FAKE!"" comments were on those videos with the longest red bars, as if, people were deriving sadistic pleasure seeing their downvotes lengthening the red bar. It was a good decision removing the Redness altogether. But, still, while the negativity was absent, Green still gave the image of ""Better!"" or ""Nicer"". I guess YouTube has realized that there is indeed no relation between how good a video is and how many likes or dislikes it gets. While a racist video might top the green bar, Rebecca's Friday would be crowned as the most disliked video of YouTube. Whoa, that doesn't make sense to me.Its a good move to stick to Blue I guess. Blue is a neutral color, carrying no biases with it. (Unless the feminists shriek saying its male-biased now.) I guess YouTube has decided to do away with the whole good vs bad image on the basis of the votes. Although all this sounds fine, it will be interesting to see if it really results in the viewers being less bitchy with the videos.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"Facebook should be used with a bit of caution else you'll be prone to sadness and loneliness. I personally have experienced this and this is what I feel.Everyone projects only those parts of their lives on Facebook that they want to display and gather appreciation and approval in form of 'likes'. A Facebook profile of a person is how he wants himself to be perceived. Digital medium lets you edit your life, filter out the negative part and just keep the stuff that is agreeable to you. In many ways, it is a fabricated image, selectively made up of successes and happiness-es, with the sad times weeded out.When you see this fabricated life of your friends, made up of only the happiest status updates of their lives, the pictures in which they look the best, shared posts that make them appear most philosophical and sensible, you are just looking at the image they want to be projected of themselves. If you compare this with your real life, you will most likely feel that their lives is much better than yours, while in fact there lives might be just as boring or well just as exciting as yours.So, do not compare the joys of real lives with the virtual post updates.

Ashris-Choudhury,"The audio courses by Pimsleur, Michelle Thomas, Rosetta Stone and many others are really helpful. The lessons are based on established methods of the brain's natural way of grasping a language. I find the lessons really interactive and interesting.

Ashris-Choudhury,"This is a tricky question, but I'll try to put forth my opinion.Judicial laws are not based on absolute black and white facts but perceived morality of the country where the laws are framed. Law punishes what seems 'immoral' to the law-makers. The intensity of the punishment increases with their perceived immorality of the act. Consider homosexuality. Orthodox countries like Uganda, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Iran and Iraq have death sentences for homosexual acts (Here are the 10 countries where homosexuality may be punished by death). On the other hand, more liberal countries like USA, Ireland, Canada and UK have it 'legal'. The laws represent the morals of a region.Hence, coming to the question, we don't have laws against killing animals as we do when we kill humans because we don't consider killing animals immoral, rather 'as immoral' as killing humans. So, its a question more to do with morality than with justice.Why do we consider killing humans more immoral than animals?1. We measure worth of life based on sentience.Sentience is ability to feel or perceive. It is human nature to 'feel' for beings that have emotions. The more an animal can express emotions, the stronger humans have sympathy for them. Think about it. When is the last time anybody argued against taking away lives of plants, bacteria, fungi, or insects? They have life as much as we do, but because we don't connect with them emotionally, we don't really care.In contrast, there was a huge furor against the recent Yulin festivals where thousands of dogs were killed for food. Such response didn't come for chickens and pigs because we connect with dogs more emotionally than with chickens and pigs. By extension, we have the strongest connection with fellow humans because they are much more complex sentimentally. 2. We care for useful animalsCows are treated as 'Mothers' in India because they have been responsible for farming, producing milk, generating cow dung to use as fuel and ploughing the lands for farming. Killing cows is prohibited by religion in India. Being a secular country, there is no rule as such in the judiciary, but our moral stance is pretty clear on the issue. 3. We value resourcesAs you've pointed out in the question, we don't care about animals that are available in plenty even if they are useful. They will always be around. Hence, the value attached to a single animal is less compared to value of life of a single animal belonging to a rare species. Hence, killing a cat is not a crime, while killing an elephant is. We wish to preserve rare resources and not lose out on scarce animals. 4. Cost-Benefit AnalysisEven if an animal is sentinel and useful, if we have strong grounds to justify the killing, we go ahead and do it. For example, its hard to argue about rights of chickens and pigs when there exists a billion dollar meat industry, loads of cuisines around us that celebrates the 'tasty' dishes made out of sheep, chicken, goats and cows. It is easy to forget about their pain because over centuries, it is made to look 'normal' and hence not 'immoral'.We don't eat horses, lions, tigers and bears and the only reason they were killed was for hunting, which was done solely for entertainment and pleasure which is not strong enough reason as opposed to 'taste' and 'culture' in case of cows and pigs, to defend their killing. Hence, we consider it more 'immoral' to kill these animals.I think the issue is very subjective and the law is the generalization of how people feel about taking away an animal's life. A larger animal dies with lot more 'visible' pain and blood than a 'smaller' animal and hence its easier to ignore the latter while sympathize with the former.I wonder if we had to kill animals with our own hands to then cook them rather than buying the meat off shops, how many people would still do so.",high,high,high,mid,low
Ashris-Choudhury,"There are several things which I have always taken for granted. But as I come to an age of understanding, I can appreciate the finer ways in which they helped me grow.No child-gibberish stuffMy mother while pursuing her post-graduate in gynecology used to explain me basics of biology. At an age when children learnt the alphabets, I knew how digestive system works, what do duodenum and spleen do, how many vitamins are there and so on. I would go on asking infinite questions and she would patiently answer each one correctly with no cooked up stuff to silence me. When I used to bother my grandma with questions like ""why are there cyclones?"" and she said things like ""Wind gods are angry"", my mother used to explain me about pressure differences then. My mother narrated me all the tales from Mahabharata, Ramayana and the other mythologies. Although an atheist now, I have learnt so much morality from them.Value of educationI come from a family where education is highly valued. My parents lived far away.because of their jobs. My relatives advised that I could live in my native place. My dad didn't want that and I moved with him to the city. Living in the south, there was no way I could do with Hindi and that meant I had to be good at English, from a very small age. In India, you are unfairly advantaged all your life if you get hold of English. Till my matriculation and even during my JEE preparation days, my mother would go through my books and help me out with my studies. I never went to tuition and learnt how to study on my own. When she was posted in a rural place, I had to travel 17 km each day for 5 years to get to my school, the nearest English medium school there. I could see how much they valued education and it stayed imbibed in my head.Value of moneyI never indulged in spending money like water. I learnt from my parents to use resources judiciously and optimally. Value of a joint family Even when my dad lived miles away from our native place, he made sure he'd come during the major festivities, be in touch with all my relatives and expect the same from me too. They taught me how to be well-behaved and mannered with people and responsible and caring with younger ones. Even when they are in their 50s, they touch feet of their elders which still reminds me how rooted to their traditions they are.Value of LoveMy parents have been living away from each other for 17 years now because of their jobs. But I cannot help but adore how loving they are and how much they care for each other. When my friends fall in love over Facebook, and have breakups over silly issues and go into extremes over their melodrama, I cannot help but feel so lucky to have an amazing ideal couple as my parents. They are still as romantic, caring and respectful to each other as they were ten years ago. IndependenceWith all the rules, my parents have given me a lot of freedom. Way too much, I think at times. I was never reprimanded for expressing my views. That also reminds me of the huge faith they put on me and I try to not disappoint them. My best friendMy mother is practically my best friend. Well, being the only kid and also having a very limited friend circle, I was and am still very close to my mother. I remember the days when I was huge, gigantically fat, a lot of kids used to tease me. My relatives too greeted me with ""Ah! what do you eat!"". My mother never used a single derogatory remark.

Ashris-Choudhury,"Nothing in the world is Right or Wrong completely... it all depends on your perspective.Over the years I have realized that the rules of morality were made to avoid chaos in this world and to give a structure to our lives. We created these rules to help ourselves in times of clashes of wants and crisis of what decisions to take. That's the reason I cite to explain why we invented religions.Essentially, if I can convince myself that an act that I commit is not wrong, no Rulebook or no assertion can make me feel guilty about it.For example, murder in general sense is a wrong act but when soldiers do it, its bravery. That part where you'd say ""Hey! But that is for the sake of the country. They are risking their lives so that you asshole can type answers on Quora happily""... that is the convincing part... What technically is a murder may be interpreted as a sin somewhere and an act of heroism somewhere else.Furthermore, a priest may say that watching porn is bad because it is immoral and God may stop loving me, Feminist groups may say that it is a crime since it shall make me more likely to be a rapist and someone else may say that it is totally cool since what I don't directly harm anybody else and another interpretation says that I need to watch it or else I won't be a dude. Same with smoking, drinking, acceptance of homosexuality and so on. I will still smoke weed knowing that it harms my lungs if I have convinced myself that its a cool thing. And if being cool is all that matters to me, no medical report or lecture will prevent me from smoking. I can also reason out that it relieves me of stress. Maybe I stop smoking later just because my girlfriend wants me to.Hence, as long as I can explain something to myself or provide a reason for, there is no way logic or rationality or morality can change my decision.

Ashris-Choudhury,"Infinity is really not a precise number, its a concept. A symbol used to represent any quantity that is huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge.If there was a lower bound I could set for a number to be ∞, the very fact that I can represent it that way would make it not big enough to be called ∞.Assuming your question still demands a 'small infinity', let me quote Hazel from 'Fault in our Stars'. Wait, let me get my tissue paper.“There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1. There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million. Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.”Ah, let me wipe my moist eyes before I proceed further.So you see, an ∞ can be indeed larger than another ∞. ∞ is like a variable to store a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge number.P.S: The example Hazel cites here is mathematically wrong. According to the strict laws of maths, there are just as many numbers between 0 and 1 as 0 and 1 million. If you take every number between 0 and 1 and double them, you will get all numbers between 0 and 2, you triple them, you get between 0 and 3 and ad nauseum.But, the set of all integers in the world is smaller than set of real numbers between 0 and 1, yes. I hope that is intuitive enough though.So there you go, the size of the set of all integers in the world is a 'small'-er infinite than the set of real numbers between any two quantities.

Ashris-Choudhury,"Well, ""more convenient"" isn't exactly a quantifiable term. While calculating the angular momentum about any point, the moments due to the forces being applied on that point are zero (moment=rxF and r=0 in this case). We calculate the rxF components for every other force being applied on the body. For this method to generate a correct value, you should be knowing the r(displacement vector) and the F(force vector) values for every point on the body.Now, since all the forces applied on a rigid body can be considered as the resultant acting on the center of mass, many complicated problems are avoided as now we have to deal with just a single point and not infinitely many. When you choose the C.O.M as your reference point for calculation of the angular momentum, you are essentially discarding the resultant force. Now, there is no other way but to calculate the rxF components for every other point.However, when you choose a different point, you no longer need to be worried about any point except the C.O.M.

I was watching the 1971 movie 'A Clockwork Orange' today which exactly has the same scenario as described.The rogues would knock the doors reporting a person who needs immediate help as he has met with an accident. As soon as the owner of the house would open their doors, the rogues would barge in and commit crime.Growing incidents of cases where criminals have been trying to exploit the victim's sympathy or goodwill to attack them have rose. It is very important to be cautious and refrain from falling into their traps.Let me relate a true story that happened with someone. On a train journey, there are kids who beg for food from the passengers. Out of sympathy, the folks gave one of their food packets to them. The kids ate it.I was shocked to listen what happened next.The kid pretended to be choking and getting unconscious animatedly. While many people and also the police had gathered around after a while, the passengers concerned had to pay the beggars a hefty amount of money as compensation.It disgusts me. While I try not to be rude and unhelpful, I make sure several times that I am no way being tricked.Well, in such a case, if you have even the slightest doubt of danger, refrain from extending any helpful. It is better to be skeptical than be fooled and tricked.",high,high,high,mid,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm the OP.I'm truly humbled by the response to this question.Dr. Ashok Banga's answer is already going viral and I am truly happy about it.My reason for posting this question1. I found this surgical misadventure ethically wrong on so many levels. An eight year old kid was used like a lab rat for another child to get famous. Where are the people who talk about child abuse?2. I found it appalling that there were 10k+ upvotes  to this answer and only a few actually protested. Quora is supposed to be composed of an educated lot.3. I actually found people supporting these kinds of dangerous acts when I put in my objections in the comments section. That to me seems quite a scary thought.I do not deny that this boy, Akrit Jaswal is truly a prodigious talent and someone who should be carefully guided into doing truly great things in the future. It was unfortunate that his parents chose to make him a show pony and I'm sure they would have profited from it. In effect they stole this boy's childhood.Like I have said in the comments, Surgery is not a work of genius but more of dedication, practice, wisdom and judgement. As a surgeon myself, I do not believe there are born surgeons. For me the best surgeon is the one who tries to be better everyday. It is a process and may sometimes take a whole lifetime. Genius has nothing to do with it. In fact the most gifted doctors are prone to overconfidence, taking unnecessary risks, being careless and uncaring about their patients. This boy had immense potential but his parents ruined it by scarring him with this ignominious episode. We could have found a good playground for this boy's genius. This playground could have been a lot of things but not a human life.By this question, several answers and the discussions thereof I hope we can prevent such a thing from happening again and people are more careful about endorsing quackery however popular.Thank you all for such a fruitful discussion.Edit1 : This edit is for some clarifications on some of the comments to the answers for this question.1. Some have told that the original answer is correct as it is about intelligence. The said answer lists operating at 7 years of age as an intelligence marker which is what is wrong about the answer. You cannot separate that part from his other accomplishments listed. The person who answered the question does not make any comment on that not being a part of his ""intelligent"" achievements.2. Some have commented that the procedure done by the boy is a simple affair. To quote ad verbatim from the comments to my post:  In truth, it was a fairly simple procedure.  He wasn't cutting into any body cavities and the whole thing was over in an hour. It sounds like he just sliced her skin with a scalpel.  If not for the scrubs and the scalpel, it would have been no different than my dad cutting splinters out of my thumb as a child.Ah not so simple. Bleeding remains a serious risk. How do we know she wouldn't bleed to death? People hiring a quack for an operation would not bother about blood work and anaesthesia. Yes Anaesthesia is also an issue. You cannot slice skin in anybody without adequate anaesthesia. In an adult it would require at least a regional anaesthesia and in a child such as this it would require general anaesthesia. The voice is muted in the video so we cannot really tell how much pain the girl was suffering. I'm guessing they may have knocked her up with chloroform, choral hydrate, alcohol or combinations thereof which in itself poses a dangerous proposition and maybe riskier than the procedure itself.3. Some have said that the parents tried to get treatment for 5 years and yet did not get treatment so had to resort to this quackery. (source: internet with suspect veracity). In India, government hospitals and several charitable organizations offer FREE treatment and surgeries for Indian Citizens. I understand people outside India cannot wrap their heads around the FREE part. India has a socialist policy towards healthcare. This kind of a case could have been easily taken care of at a district hospital and they did not even need to come to the city. It certainly wouldn't have taken 5 years for them to get treatment. India is not so bad off that we need to resort to witch doctors and quacks to cure our sick and morbid. We are not some impoverished country without any resources for our citizens. Despite our challenges we are getting better at treating our citizens. Our citizens deserve a standard of care as the best in the world. I would be appalled if anyone would assume that Indian people getting less than standard treatment is a non-issue.4. This is for people who are relying on Wikipedia for information. The disclaimer on top of that article says a lot about the validity of what is inside it.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Three instances of Scientific fraud come to mind which have caused immense harm to the world and has lost the medical fraternity a lot of credibility.The Bezwoda Deceit: Werner Bezwoda was a professor of Haematology and Oncology at the University of Witwatersrand (Wits) in South Africa. He published papers providing the first positive evidence of High dose chemotherapy (HDC) with Autologous Bone Marrow Transplant (ABMT) as superior to standard chemotherapy which was being given at the time for Metastatic breast carcinoma. Based on his papers presented in 1992 and published in 1995, Oncologists began recommending this treatment to their patients. When insurances refused citing experimental procedure, the courts upheld the patient's plea and awarded record damages to the tune of millions of dollars to patients. While in the mid 80's there were hardly about 100 ABMTs/year, in the period between 1989- 1995 there was nearly 6000 cases of HDC+ABMT for breast cancer alone. In the Plenary session of American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 1999, Bezwoda's study was the only study that supported HDC/BMT while three other large scale studies from  US and Scandinavian countries failed to replicate Bezwoda's success. Hence the American researchers went to South Africa to audit the data from Bezwoda's study where they found that he had fabricated data to get the results of what he wanted. The HDC/ABMT treatment was found to have no more survival benefit than the standard chemotherapy. The scientific community went down hard on Bezwoda. They retracted the two landmark papers. The University fired him. He has not been seen in public since. The damage he had done by that time was far more than the lives lost. Due to his loss of integrity today High dose Chemotherapy has been put to the back burner even if we have better chemotherapeutic drugs than when it was banned. No one wants to go down that road again. That one lie has cost our medical fraternity a loss of integrity and trust.High-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantMedscape Log In(Dr.) Andrew Wakefield's Corrupted ResearchJust elaborating on Joel Ruggaber's answer.Andrew Wakefield is a British former surgeon and medical researcher working in Royal Free Hospital in London (at the time) who published in 1998 along with 12 co-authors, his now infamous paper in Lancet. The paper claimed to have discovered a new syndrome called Autistic Enterocolitis which raised a possibility of a link between inflammatory bowel disease, autism and the MMR vaccine. Though the paper did not state a causal link, Wakefield took it upon himself to call a press conference to claim that MMR vaccine could be a cause of autism in a small sub-set of children receiving it. This was termed as 'Science by press conference' and was widely criticized by the scientific community. This press conference and not the actual paper was the reason for spreading fear among a large population of parents to stop vaccinating with MMR in USA, UK and Ireland mainly. This brought about the resurgence of measles and mumps in these countries and has resulted in a number of deaths which could have been prevented if not for Wakefield's assertions. Subsequently he was fired from The Royal Free Hospital for refusing to replicate his study again. His study claims could not be replicated in other studies conducted around the world. Brian Deer a reporter at the Sunday times revealed with documentary proof, Wakefield's conflict of interest, his cherry picking of results and fraudulent data from which he based his research. He apparently received  400,000 pounds from lawyers fighting an MMR lawsuit. It was further revealed that the Legal Aid Board had granted 55,000 pounds for Wakefield's research. Wakefield had applied for patent for a single jab measles vaccine before publishing his paper. So in effect he had multiple conflicts of interest which was not revealed during submission. Later on Lancet withdrew the paper citing Wakefield's fraudulent research and 10 of 12 co-authors publicly retracted support for the research. Also other concerns involving the research involved bio-ethics and medical ethics where 8 of the 12 children were enrolled into the study by the lawyer who paid wakefield money. Unnecessary invasive procedures were done on autistic children resulting in child abuse. In the end it was found that original data did not even find inflammatory bowel disease in any of the 12 children. The UK GMC finally stripped him of his license and condemned his paper and research.Andrew WakefieldThe problem did not end with the Lancet retraction. Wakefield's fraudulent assertions gave rise to a following of conspiracy theorists headed by celebrity Jenny McCarthy among others in USA and several countries. Wakefield moved to Texas, USA and continues to defend his research and is at the forefront of anti-MMR vaccination propaganda. This kind of anti-vaccine activists are doing irreparable damage even as we speak to medical science's fight towards eradicating preventable illnesses which is unfortunate.The Tuskegee Syphilis experiments:This episode is not considered as a scientific fraud per se but a violation of human rights and medical ethics. This study is considered the most infamous biomedical study in US history. To put it across briefly- in 1932, US Public Health Service authorized a study on the natural progression of untreated syphilis in  African Americans under the garb of free treatment. Even though Penicillin was established as proven cure for Syphilis in the 1940s, the research was allowed to continue till 1972. The Test subjects had no idea a study was being conducted and there was no informed consent. The White study investigators kept the research under wraps and refused to offer treatment to patients despite evidence of a cure. The test subjects and their families were also discouraged to seek treatment elsewhere. This resulted in the death and disability of many of the 400 test subjects and their families. The results of the study did not add anything to the information already discovered and there was no reason to continue the study for such a long duration all the while trampling on human decency, human rights, medical ethics and ethical research. Citizens of a country which calls itself a democracy treated their fellow citizens like lab animals. I would call this episode as ""scientific fraud by omission"". Unethical Human experiments gained prominence after the world war II when Human experiments which were carried out by the Germans and Japanese on their prisoners was widely criticized. This actually gave rise to Intitutional review boards for ethical research and all research had to go through the IRB to go ahead. In 1964 the WHO's Declaration of Helsinki specified that experiments involving human subjects required ""informed consent"". Despite this the Tuskegee experiments continued unabated until a whistle blower alerted the authorities in 1972. In the end it was nothing but a government funded Unethical research nothing short of the Nazi treatment of the Jews or Japanese torture of their prisoners during world war II.Tuskegee syphilis experimentThe problem with Fraudulent or unethical research is that it does more harm than what one can predict. We as medical professionals keep seeing fraudulent and unethical research popping up at respectable medical journals. We can see it  and sometimes oppose it but cannot fight with enough evidence and funding to back the claims. The pharma industry, the hospitals, corrupt medical doctors and researchers  all can form a cohesive unit to cover up fraud in a quagmire of legal, medical and ethical jargon which is beyond the scope of a medical doctor to confront. That is not to say that all research conducted today are fraudulent and should not be believed. There are a lot of studies which are improving our understanding of the human body, disease, morbidity, role of genetics and the treatments thereof. I myself am involved in medical research in my small way. I just hope to put in my small piece of the jigsaw puzzle before I am through. I just call for scientific integrity from researchers. One's need to be famous doesn't supersede the loss of a single human life.My point is that research should be seen on individual merit and intelligently analyzed by independent groups before setting accepted guidelines for diagnosis, protocols and treatments. As a Doctor I also take in new research with outrageous claims with a pinch of salt. I would wait for results to be replicated by multiple unrelated sources of study before I take it seriously. This needs immense studiousness and wisdom on the part of a treating doctor. I hope the future generation of doctors are up to the task.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"It is an interesting question which needs a good analogy to make it objective. I'll try.I can give many but I'll stick to two.When you buy a ticket for a football match you buy it in the hope that the team you support will win the match. Of course that team tries its best to win it. In case the team loses will you approach the team/football authorities to refund your ticket?When you buy a lottery ticket will you ask for a refund if you don't win the jackpot?In much the same way that you cannot predict who will win the match or the lottery no one can predict the success of a surgery. I would venture to say a surgeon would give you better odds than football or lottery. People think just because a family has lost a family member they are not liable to pay the hospital or doctor. This sets a dangerous precedent. Hospitals and in turn doctors would then cut their losses and not take up difficult/severe cases for surgery. Somebody whose life could potentially be saved would not get to the operating table due to this culture. Also if you suspect negligence from the treating doctor or hospital, if you haven't paid the previously agreed fees then you cannot sue for malpractice/negligence. Please pay your doctor and the hospital for service despite a negative result. Doctors and hospitals do sometimes waive the charges in such cases but you are not the one to decide.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The most awkward moment for me is when a patient comes to me after having had a surgery and while examining I realize that the previous surgeon has messed it up. I have to be truthful to the patient while not criticizing the previous surgeon. A real awkward situation!I've faced this a few times and it is never a good idea to criticize your colleague's work in front of patients. The catch is you might think the patient would be grateful to you if you point out any mistakes the other surgeon has committed, but in reality the patient may just decide to sue the previous surgeon using you as expert witness! Criticizing someone else is the easiest thing to do but you end up antagonizing that surgeon and other doctors too. Another thing about the criticism is that it does zilch to the patient's primary purpose. In the process of a long medical career it is not unreasonable that someday you will be that previous surgeon and an another surgeon is criticizing your surgery.Complications and errors can happen even in the best of hands. It is important that a doctor's focus should be in improving a patient's condition and not that of one-upmanship.Edit: People have asked me in the comments how I deal with such an awkward situation?I don't talk about the previous surgeon or surgery at all. I tell them they may need another surgery to improve the results. That way the conversation is focused on what can be achieved from then on rather than what could have been.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Few things about Singapore you may find useful:1. Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world. A bicycle tyre theft is displayed on hoardings there!!! Rest assured people are not going to get mugged in Singapore.2. Locals are accustomed to foreign visitors, they are fluent in English and are extremely helpful when asked. Always ask locals for directions.3. You can buy a local sim for very cheap and easy to buy in any 7/11 shop. I would advise that visitors buy a local sim and use the balance amount on a data plan. Never do international calls- very expensive. Use the data plan to Whatsapp, Google maps and Viber to call people back home. 4G internet is super fast.3. If short on time travel by taxis. Uber  mobile app works in Singapore as long as you have an international credit card registered.4. Airports, hotel rooms and malls have free WiFi. Never miss the opportunity to use them.5. If you have some time on your hands in Singapore you can take public transport. One of the best and cheapest public transport in the world. You can buy a smart cart called tourist pass which gives you unlimited access to trains and buses. The deposit for the pass is refundable if you return it within 5 days. (http://home.ezlink.com.sg/home-t...) Train stations do have vending machines for tickets if you don't want to buy the smart card. Local buses require exact change. You will not get change back if you put in extra.5. Food in fine dining restaurants can range from S$200- S$1500 (for a couple). Every mall in Singapore has a food court. I suggest visitors to find them and eat there only. You can have a meal for less than S$4. There is amazing variety in the food courts but it is self service. 6. Pure vegetarian restaurants are hard to find in Singapore. Little India, Clarke Quay and Boat Quay are places to find vegetarian Indian food. However vegatarian food is more expensive than sea food in Singapore.7. Do not visit Jurong Bird Park. It is not well maintained. It is less impressive than other attractions in Singapore.8. Do not waste your time in Mustafa market if you are Indian. There is nothing available there that is not available for cheaper in India. The craze of the 90s is useless.9. My recommendations for tourists are Gardens by the bay conservatory and its music show, marina bay sands and its laser show, Singapore zoo, night safari, botanical gardens, orchard road, Bugis flea market, Clarke Quay sentosa island and Universal studios.I hope that was useful for you.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I have used both Uber and Ola. My experiences with both have generally been positive. I'll share you my experience.The Uber experienceI was quite sold on Uber first since that was the first cab-aggregator app I used. I had very happily used Uber in Singapore while I was living there and US cities-NY, LA and Chicago. I found it extremely great service and reliable at that. They also offerred very generous rewards for being loyal customers and for referrals. During this period I even used it in many Indian cities like Bangalore, Mumbai and yes even New Delhi. All excellent service. I really had no reason to change.Switch to OlaI came back to India for good- Bangalore- in march this year. I heard there was a new stud in town taking over the market by a storm. By then the infamous New Delhi cab rape case had removed a significant sheen off Uber and they were reeling from the reactions. Ola were offering free rides left right and center. Customers like free things. I did what any decent customer would do- drain the company's offers till the last drop trickles in. The next few months I literally used the Ola app whenever I could use one of their incredible offers. But good times always ends. Almost what seemed like overnight, they stopped their predatory pricing tactics and started cashing in on the monopoly. On regular rides they started charging surcharge saying peak time charges. They started with 1.2x and 1.5x and bordered on the ludicrous 2.5x. This had to stop. I shifted to the path of least resistance (read 'cost')I went back to Uber. By this time Uber had learnt their lessons and modified their business strategy. It was now their turn for predatory pricing. They offered the cheapest ride in Bangalore. On some routes and times Uber was cheaper than even an autorickshaws. I then spent the next couple of months ignoring Ola and using Uber exclusively. I was again being a very responsible customer (i.e. loot the company).Then there was a return of the night-mare- literally!I had catch an early morning flight a few days back. Only Ola allows pre-booking. Since Bangalore airport is 2 hrs away from Bangalore I wanted to make sure that a cab is available at 3 am in the morning instead of depending upon chance. So I pre-booked the cab in the Ola app which assured me of it's promise.3am ordealThe driver did not turn up on time. I had to call the driver up to wake him and make him come to the house for pick up. He was already half an hour late. While going to the airport he took a long route just so that he could collect more fare. I was sleeping in the cab so didn't notice the longer route. The distance between my house and the airport is 43kms as evidenced from Google maps.​​​​​There was some network issues near the airport. So when he said Rs. 990, I just paid up without calculating since I was getting late for the flight (because of the driver of course).Later when I received the receipt in the app I realized I had been cheated of nearly Rs. 300 bucks​​​​Ola customer supportI shot off an angry email to the customer care:I'm happy and very impressed to note that they responded back within a day and some good news from their side.​​​Today I got back the refunded money and the corrected receipt was sent to my mail id.​​​Well I'm certainly impressed by their customer service which was quite prompt. I wish Ola took more accountability of the drivers and rein in on their temptation to loot their customers in the same way we looted them. :-). While they are at it, some more free rides would be more than welcome. Also some more Uber- Ola wars will yield good dividends for vultures-like customers like us.I hate to sound ungrateful towards the Ola guys after their excellent customer support, but some great man once said:""A company is worth nothing if you can't make money out of it""Or did I just make that up! ;-)",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I've read the many answers here- apologetic to inflammatory to plain rude.It is not even about money or about Indians being a miserly or mean or whatever. The biggest reason in my opinion is difference in Culture and Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)CultureEastern cultures like the Subcontinent, China and even most of East Asia do not consider tipping a matter of right. In fact any type of tipping in Japan is met with bewilderment  or  deemed as an insult (some of my friends who have gone there inform me). In Singapore too, only a few high end restaurants encourage tipping. I remember one incident when I was living in Singapore, we were going to China Town tour,  when an american offered a volunteer guide a tip, the volunteer was offended about it and told him to donate that tip to the old age fund if he wanted to. I hear the tipping in other East Asian countries are in the range of 5-8% and again not linked the waiters' salaries.In India the tips are not decided as a percentage of the total bill but it is in deference to the type of restaurant one is eating in. In a small roadside eatery with a bill of about Rs. 200-300 (~$4) the typical tip is Rs. 10. In a fine dining restaurant with a bill of about Rs. 3000 (~$40), the tip would be in the range of Rs. 50-100 and usually never beyond that. It is meant as a goodwill gesture for good service and not considered part of the employees salary. In fact some well known local restaurants and even big chains like Barbecue Nation, Mainland China, etc, tipping is strictly discouraged. The local restaurants absorb the service charge while the big chains charge 4-10% of total bill as service charge so that the amount made by all waiters is similar. This is in addition of various other mandatory taxes like VAT, Service Tax,etc.This is the typical bill break up in India:​​Source: MoneyIn India a restaurant charging service charge, we are not expected to keep a tip. Also waiters are not dependent on the tips as much as their monthly salary from their employers.Purchasing parityWhen I was visiting US last year a half decent meal in a typically unspectacular restaurant cost me about $100 for a meal for two. Service wasn't that great either, but I was expected to keep a $20 tip even if it is not good service. There's no negotiation or accountability for that tip. $20 is Rs. 1300 and that can buy 2 unlimited buffet meals at a high end restaurant in India. I will admit that I found it very painful to leave that $20 as a tip for less than average service. My cousins who are settled down in the US leave generous tips at all restaurants which is because they earn in dollars and are more in line with the American tipping culture. So Indians settled in US tip people as well as a US citizen.Personally I don't mind tipping waiters a decent amount and I always do when I get good service. But this guilt tripping of Indian tourists and  labeling them bad tippers and saying they are cruel is uncalled for. Often I see many tourists overcompensate for this reputation and tip obscene amounts even for average service.This survey of 1000 waiters in US showed that asians in general are not that far from average tipping. The Christians (whatever that means), Hispanics and Blacks are apparently the worst tippers and this spectrum image comes from an article which propagates the virtues of tipping in America.​​Source: Everything You Don't Know About Tipping - Wait But Why",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The major premise of your argument is that you want one industry's money to compensate for the poverty of the whole country. It is like replacing a watermelon with a lemon.Questions like these keep popping up every now and then (not only on Quora)Some examples:1. Why did Indian government have to spend 450 crores on a space mission when 400million people are below poverty line?2. Why do CEOs of Indian companies have to be paid so high when we have 40% of our fresh graduates without a job?3. Why does the film industry have to spend crores on crappy movies when crores of people are devastatingly poor? (Much like your question)4. Why should we spend so much on higher education and universities like IITs, AIIMS, IIMs when more 50% of our children do not get past middle school?5. Why should we have state of the art medical facilities in India when 80% of the population cannot afford it and people don't have access to even primary health in villages?The people who speak this language want India to become a welfare state where money is taken from the rich and stuffed into people masquerading as custodians of the poor. It makes very poor economic sense. Poverty is such a complex problem that even if you throw billions of dollars at this problem it is not going to get solved. If money was all it took- Bill Gates, Narayan Murthys and Azim Premjis of the world would have cured us of poverty long back.  All over the world the only way poverty has been alleviated is by improvement in economic atmosphere, open market, single payer socialised health care, education and equality in opportunity. This is where the stress of governance should be and not on restricting booming industries.  The solutions for our country's poverty is not to provide rice at 1 rupee, free electricity, free water, free refrigerators, fans and TVs.....or free anything. If we want our countrymen to get out of poverty, it is to give them the tools to sustain themselves, give them power to purchase rather than depend on doles of the politicians. They should come up the social and economical ladder while in the process help our country grow through their contributions. Education and life skill training is the only way out.Our politicians are very short sighted in policy making. Their questions are similar to the above questions.1. Like blocking the FDI bill in the name of protecting local entrepreneurs2. Like not letting land acquisition bill from getting passed in parliament preventing industries from coming up in India- all in the name of protecting farmers.3. Like providing rice and wheat for Re. 1 when it is being subsidised by the tax payer's money. This increases debt and eventually inflation increases alarmingly. In the near future when you buy an onion, you will cry even without cutting it. Don't you think that this is rather stupid?I'm not saying all this because I'm a big fan of Bahubali or Telugu Cinema. I may not even watch it. From my perspective it is as good as a Salman Khan movie but if it generates revenue I'll be more than happy that some part of the pie is going into my country's progress.The movies,TV, print and other forms of media are a very important and successful parts of our economy. It generates and distributes vast amounts of wealth in various forms. Out of the 250 crore spent on this movie, thousands of jobs have been created, many artists have got a platform to showcase their wares, very high amount of taxes have been paid. With every movie ticket that is sold the state gets part of the revenue as taxes. The high earning actors, directors, producers, other artists etc contribute to our country through the high rate of taxes they pay. This is what runs the country. The 10% of the population boost our economy to fund the progress of our entire country. You need to accept that fact.Do not kill our golden goose.

Consuming multivitamins or obscene amounts of carrots/beetroots will not improve vision or reduce myopia as some people believe.

Many diseases can be diagnosed by examining the eyes with certain instruments. This video by national geographic is a brilliant demonstration of what I'm saying.http://video.nationalgeographic....8. Plastic Surgery is not synonymous with cosmetic surgery. Cosmetic surgery is a small sub-field of Plastic surgery. Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to What is the difference between cosmetic surgery and reconstructive surgery?9. Most chronic diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes, Asthma, Heart disease, Glaucoma are not curable but can be effectively controlled with appropriate medication to reduce morbidity and mortality. If the general public makes peace with this fact and not run behind miracle cures by quacks which promise everything from curing diabetes to seeing god- they would actually live a lot longer than was possible before.10. Cancer needs to be considered as a Chronic disease rather than a death sentence. We are seeing such good survival rates in cancers which just a decade ago had patients dying within months of diagnosis. Just like diabetes, hypertension etc cancer prevention is the real deal. Lifestyle modifications like stopping smoking & consumption of tobacco, reducing alcohol intake & high calorie foods, regular exercise, balanced anti-oxidant rich diet, etc. can go a long way in preventing cancer. But despite these preventive measures, cancer can happen. When it does happen it is important that one reaches the right people who can manage it- again these people are not the quacks who promise cure for cancer.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to What do doctors think of Ayurvedic medicine?11. The accurate term for practitioners of AYUSH* would be Vaid, Yogi, Hakim, Siddhar and Homoeopath respectively. But these terms are hardly used in cities by these practitioners. So when you see them calling themselves doctor, it is actually wrong but our law system is lacking on that count. *AYUSH - Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Sidda and Homeopathy - branches of alternative medicine.12. Practitioners of alternative medicine do not have the privilege of prescribing allopathic medicines by law. Our laws are lacking on that too with regards to punishment for doing it. The government itself  hires doctors of alternative medicine to man allopathic primary health centres. There is a drive by newspapers recently to change the law so that alternative medicine practitioners can prescribe allopathic medicines which in my opinion is a dangerous move.13. A lot people have asked me about their wish to be an organ donor. There are several organizations which registers people as organ donors and they send a nice card to keep in your wallet. A donor card and your wish is useless if your family refuses/ forgets/ delays organ harvesting after your death. I would tell any prospective donor to convince the whole family about their express wish and educate them of the importance of not delaying the harvesting of organs. The family should contact relevant people before it is too late to be of any use.14. Doctors understand that volumes drive down healthcare costs and increase profits. As a case example Narayana Hrudayalaya in Bangalore does 44 Heart bypass surgeries a day (highest in the world). A CTVS surgeon there on an average performs about 24 bypass surgeries/week. The average cost of bypass in NH is USD$1500 (Rs. 90,000- lowest in the world). The hospital is running profits of $16 million/year (Total revenue $128 million) - just one brand of hospitals in a developing country!! It is win-win for both doctors and patients. Philanthropy has to be self sustaining to be successful.Biggest Innovations: Narayana Health has successfully married affordability, quality health care 15. This is the last but certainly important. I have worked in all types of hospitals. Government, private, semi-private, corporate. What I find is that not just having the most money doesn't guarantee you the best medical care available. Money is required of course but it can only get you so much, not everything! I often see that the best treated patients are ones with average means but ones who make informed decisions about their care. Having a single dedicated primary doctor is better than having 15 super-specialists on your case.I can maybe add some more when it occurs to me later on. Watch this space! :-)Thanks for the A2A Surya Vasisht",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"There are several ways the Government can help Indian doctors to serve India more efficiently and satisfactorily.Healthcare funding and infrastructureIndia claims to be a state with socialized healthcare but it is lacking on the ground. India spends only 4% of it's GDP on healthcare out of which only 0.8% is the government's share. With such low levels of investment on the government's part which by the way also includes training doctors, staff salaries and hospital supplies it is a miracle that Indian government hospitals are able to treat patients.Compare that to UK- 7.8% of the total of 9.1% of it's GDP of the healthcare expenditure is government funded. NHS of UK is a model for the world for socialized health care.When government invests on healthcare infrastructure the doctors will be attracted to government hospitals for a viable career growth. When doctors do cutting edge work in government hospitals, naturally it will attract the best talent in the industry. The funding also has to extend to primary healthcare in the villages. There has to be basic infrastructure for a single/ few doctors to take care of simple day to day sickness which often gets referred to the city hospitals which then get overwhelmedPrimary healthcareThese days everyone wants to be treated by the specialist. To a lay person it might seem like the most correct thing to do and may feel that a super specialist is very accomplished hence also the most capable to treat his disease. The consequences of making the cardiologist treat a common cold is that the patient is wasting a cardiologist’s expertise and overpaying his consultation as well. People don’t realize the importance of a general practitioner or general physician in their healthcare. This discourages newly minted medical professionals from taking up general practice. It is just not viable for them. What is the government doing about this problem? They are completely ignoring the issue and like they have treated primary education, they are treating primary healthcare with the same disdain. They aren’t hiring permanent doctors for their rural areas and those hired are paid salaries once in 6 months. They are forcibly making new residents/interns serve in rural areas. This again is a huge waste of valuable resources. Orthopedic surgeons are doubling up as midwives and delivering babies in rural areas since there are no other doctors. How will this change our primary healthcare in anyway? GPs are not average doctors as people would like to think. They have a different set of skills than a super specialist. While a super specialist is restricted to a very narrow field of medicine the GP is trained to look at the patient as a whole.The recruitment for the PHCs is from the state public service commission (PSC). In Karnataka, one of the more prosperous states in India more than 50% of the slots remain vacant. Why do you think? The corrupt officials running the KPSC always recruit less even when enough applicants are present since keeping the demand high is very good business for them. The going rate of bribe in Karnataka for a PHC doctor's job right now is around 1.5-2 lakhs. The job has a listed salary of Rs. 30,000 - 42,000 pm! Many of the applicants are recruited on an ad-hoc basis streching from 6 months to 2 years and then the whole process starts again. Giving permanent jobs reduces the officials' black revenue. This has to stop. The government has to recruit the doctors in a very transparent way and curb the corruption in the recruiting process.Need for multi tier healthcare economy in government hospitals.The government hospitals need to become centers of excellence so that paying patients can approach government hospitals for their healthcare needs. I worked in Singapore where the level of care is the same in government and private hospitals. I worked in a government hospital- National University Health Systems (NUHS)- where there was a two tier payment system. All citizens and permanent residents were eligible for subsidized healthcare funded by the government insurance scheme. There was a private system which was used by richer citizens and foreigners to take personalized care from specific doctors in the government hospital roll. This encouraged the best doctors to be in government service since it paid as much as being in private hospitals. The added advantage was there was institutional support for research and development which was lacking in private hospitals.NUHS was run like any international business company. The government only funded research, initial infrastructure (which is loaned of course) and basic running costs. The hospital was supposed to run by itself. They had a full management team including a CEO, CFO and various other entities. As an example, the NUHS paid their Transport department (SMRT) a sum of S$1million to convince the SMRT to build a Metro station inside the hospital (both are government entities). This was done to attract more patients just like any business should.I want to see the same level of pragmatism in healthcare in India. The concept of volumes driving down healthcare costs and increasing profits is not a new one in India. As one of the best examples I can give,  Narayana Hrudayalaya (or Narayana Health as it is called now) in Bangalore does 44 Heart bypass surgeries a day (highest in the world). A CTVS surgeon there on an average performs about 24 bypass surgeries/week. The average cost of bypass in NH is USD$1500 (Rs. 90,000- lowest in the world). The hospital is running profits of $16 million/year (Total revenue $128 million) - just one brand of hospitals in a developing country!! It is win-win for both doctors and patients. Philanthropy has to be self sustaining to be successful. The NH now have a medical facility in the Cayman Islands where patient's from developed countries without good insurance schemes receive treatment at one tenth the cost in their home country.Biggest Innovations: Narayana Health has successfully married affordability, quality health careOther examples in eye care (my own specialty) are LV Prasad Eye Institute, (Telangana, Seemandra, Odhisha) and Aravind Eye Hospitals (Madurai, Theni, Puducherry, Chennai, Coimbatore, Nigeria). Both these hospitals have used the multi tier system to provide world class care to everyone.The advantage of this multi tier healthcare system is the rich can fund the treatment of the poor and yet both the rich and the poor receive almost the same level of medical care. Government hospitals should provide care for the rich, the large middle class and the very poor at reasonable cost appropriate to their level of income and affordability.The numbers and poor career trajectory in government serviceIndia already produces around 56,000 new MBBS graduates every year and there are only 14,000 residency slots (private and govt included) available at any given year. What happens to the rest? They get back to the competition pool, increasing the competition every year.On any given year about 1,50,000 MBBS graduates are attempting the various entrance exams for the 14,000 slots (only 5,000 of these are Govt slots, rest are private)When new doctors do not get into residencies, at that point of time have a few options:Study for PG entrance for a few more years with or without working simultaneouslyAccept low pay/no pay and work in government run primary health centers.Accept a little higher pay and work in private hospitals as duty doctors for the rest of their lives.Start a private practice which is getting more difficult in tier 1, 2, 3 cities.Pay exorbitant amount of money (Rs. 1-3 crores) to get into a residency which they will never be able to recover in their lifetime.Quit a medical career and go for an alternate career options in medical transcription, marketing, administration or research assistants, management, etcReservationThis is a very important factor. Currently there is reservation on entering medical school, then for entrance exams for Government residency slots and even for recruitment in government hospitals after MBBS or residency. This stifles meritocracy at the very top. Once a student get's into medical school and completes it, he is socially and financially uplifted from backwardness. Once in Internship, a medical student from reserved category has received the same education and opportunities as a medical student from the general category so this system of unlimited reservation till death is spoiling the meritocracy. In my opinion reservation beyond medical school has to stop. Nearly 50% of the residency slots in central government institutes are in the reserved category and those claiming them are not necessarily backward. This reservation game continues beyond residency even into recruitment after residency. It is so ludicrous that in an apex institute like AIIMS to get hired you need to be either an OBC/SC/ST candidate or a minister should recommend you (which if you didn't guess already is recruited in the general category).  So you don't see the best talent in the country in the Apex government health institute. Mediocrity rules- more than we care to admit. This is untenable in the long run.Quality of medical educationIt is important that we not compare medical education at present with what it was 40 years ago in India. Medical education today would definitely be better than the what it was in the 1970s. The comparison should be with modern standards of medical education in US/UK and other developed countries. India is severely lagging behind. Other than the institutes of excellence such has AIIMS, JIPMER, CMC- Vellore, some other top tier govt medical colleges and a few private medical colleges, the standards of medical education is appalling. The newer medical colleges in the last 10 years or so- both private and government- have reached new lows in medical education. The problem is two fold1. Government Medical Colleges They start medical colleges in very remote places in India catering to vote banks paying very low salaries to people who work there from group D worker to Professor. Infrastructure in most of the medical colleges is mediocre. Some don't even have a functioning casualty or ICU or even a pharmacy. Each of  the people working in the medical college can make more working outside the hospital than in it or make better living working in a less remote city or town. This decreases the quality of faculty and services in the medical colleges. This again decreases patient load since there is not enough manpower to treat patients. Why would a patient waste a day's labour and time to finally not getting treated. They might as well get treated in a private hospital/doctor or go to the city. When they have poor infrastructure, poor quality faculty and low patient load the quality of medical education suffers2. Private Medical CollegesIt takes a private entity or Individual about Rs. 300-400 crores to set up a new medical college including paying the bribes to central and state ministers, officials in MCI and UGC and other minor players. After they have spent significant capital on establishing the medical college the focus then becomes on recovering capital, increasing profits and reducing running costs. Infrastructure is kept at a bare minimum since MCI inspectors can be easily bought off. Many of the senior faculty are in name only and they actually have fledgling private practices. They only need to turn up to sign every week and collect their paycheck. Of course they need to show their face during the MCI inspection. Most of them do not teach and teaching is left to lower paid lecturers and tutors. They do not want to spend too much on free patient care hence they make no efforts to attract any patients. They even learn that planting patients during inspections is far cheaper. All this while they can sell the MBBS seats for Rs.50 lakhs a piece. The quality of medical education in MBBS and PG both suffer because they hardly see any patients.The problems have started to become very apparent already. I know of a medical college next to a remote forest area in Karnataka, India where students pass  their final year MBBS exam without seeing a single patient. The first real patient they see are the ones brought (for a price) from nearby hospitals on the day of the clinical exam. I wonder how the doctors passing out of such factories are going to fare in the real world.Recklessly increasing the number of medical school slots without proportionate improvement in infrastructure, faculty and patient care is not the right way to go about it. This is a lazy way to increase the number of doctors passing out. It also reflects the governments' and public's penchant for 'quick lazy solutions' for complex deep seated problems.In summary a few solutions I can think of Increase healthcare budget from the current 0.8% to at least 5% of the GDP. A healthy population is very important.MCI needs to be made corruption free and any kind of corruption among the officials should invite a life ban and heavy fines. This punishment process should be completed within a specific period of 3 months and should be permanent. Not like the present system where the corrupt return to assume office of the MCI once the heat has blown over.Medical colleges found providing low standard medical education should be banned from applying for recognition from MCI ever again.Improve salaries for people choosing to teach. There needs to an incentive for the present generation of doctors to teach the next generation. Just lip service and poor regard for existing teachers will not improve anything. I'm afraid the next generation of doctors will be deprived of the wisdom of the masters.Improve infrastructure, faculty, facilities of existing medical colleges before setting up new toothless medical colleges or increasing residency slots.Increase residency slots in a phased manner only after improving infrastructure first. The good thing about India is there there is no dearth  of patients needing free or subsidized healthcare. I foresee no shortage of clinical experience for any doctors in the near future, only the government has to pull up their socks and make a real contribution in terms of policy.Reservation beyond medical school has to stopA multi- tier health economy should be set upThe government has to recruit the doctors in a very transparent way and curb the corruption in the recruiting process. Compulsory rural service is a lazy way to tackle complex problems like rural healthcare.Give a viable career trajectory to every MBBS graduate passing out of medical school in primary, secondary, tertiary or quaternary healthcare.The Indian healthcare sector should become centers of excellence giving the latest in technology and care to Indian patient. They should encourage doctors to get into niche fields by actually providing a patient base for them. India is not short of patients.The problems are very complex and it is impossible to cover everything. I hope I have touched on many aspects of healthcare in India and about doctors who are a vital cog in this system.If you need some extra perspective you can read my other detailed answers on various aspects I have covered in this answer:Raghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Disclaimer: I  have done MS Ophthalmology and had not written the DNB entrance exam during my pre-PG time.A few years back I would have told MS/MD is better than DNB for the simple reason that the selection process for DNB was highly suspect. You getting into a DNB program depended on the right kind of people you knew or on the mercy of the institute you were working as a medical officer. It wasn't at all fair. There was no credibility for the doctor getting in. Also pass percentage was extremely low...in ortho and radio it was less than 10% pass rate. the centres never bothered about results hence no academicsBut things have changed since 2010. There is an All India DNB entrance exam and a central counselling process for both primary and secondary DNB which now adds credibility to the course and now pass rates are approaching 100% in most centers as institutes realize only having slave labour won't cut it and they will have high attrition rates if they don't invest energy into academics and teaching.Also now with Supreme Court order removing that last strand of ambiguity saying DNB and MS/MD is equivalent I don't see why I should not recommend DNB. The biggest advantage of DNB is that they get to work in the best facilities, in the top institutes with large resources available and always on the cutting edge of work done.So many of my friends and colleagues who have done DNB from big centres are doing extremely well sometimes much better than their MS/MD counterparts. With the dismal state of most medical colleges in India I see these top institutes having DNB leading the way forward in the near future. A lot of government and private medical colleges don't have good infrastructure and are staffed by retiring and retired professors. These people do not make good mentors as they are not interested in teaching the residents or making them competent surgically for the real world. Some colleges don't even give residents a chance to operate. The MCI teams which come to inspect the infrastructure are all corrupt and clear these colleges due to either political or financial clout. The MCI does not have a structured program for Residency (academic and surgical) so  the level of training is variable depending on the college and guide you land up with. As an example I did my Ophthalmology Residency from Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Kolkata  in which I found excellent mentors and incredible surgical experience. I doubt any other medical college in India can come close to the number of surgeries a resident does in RIO- Kolkata. I was extremely lucky.  Contrast that to AMU, Aligarh or BHU, Varanasi. Supposedly both are central institutes with good funding and facilities but they both  have terrible residency programs with residents hardly performing 10 cataracts surgeries (if lucky) in 3 years of residency. Or contrast that to all private medical colleges in Karnataka where I hail from. Most of these residents would not have done a single cataract surgery by the end of their residency.I'm not saying it wont happen in DNB institutes but they have profits driving their infrastructure and having residents who won't leave them make economic sense to them. they will always try to keep the standards high.In conclusion I would say both are equivalent and of the same value when it comes to jobs. The center you do it is more important than the MD/MS/DNB label.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"A2AWell I don't know if I'm really qualified to give a good answer for this question. Since it is an A2A I shall try.Disclaimer: I was and I still believe I am a very unorthodox medical student. Never followed any rules for study. I read what I liked yet I cleared my exams without fail despite that.(OK maybe with some luck). I never topped any exam in medical school. I was in the middle of my class right through MBBS. So follow my advice at your own peril. In the balance of things I didn't do too badly either.First year will be the toughest year and your first year exit exam will be the toughest exam till date. Concentrate on Anatomy as that is something you will suffer from if you don't.  First get yourself Frank Netter's Anatomy Atlas before it is too late. ​​​​Don't let anyone sell you any other inferior Atlas. I had a love hate relationship with Anatomy. I would have spent 80% of my study time in 1st year on Anatomy and hardly much time on Biochemistry. Physiology was my favorite in first year though.Read about Frank Netter here, it is fascinating:Frank Netter, MD: The Michelangelo of Medicine​​​​Isn't he the rock star? :-)Once you clear your 1st year exits you become a sort of a pro in studying medical subjects and how to clear exams. It's like you hit a hack on theory exams. Practicals and viva-voce are the scoring parts of the exams and the part where you can make up a lot of marks that you have lost out in theory exams. If you flunk in practicals (in 1st and 2nd year) you are really in bad shape and probably deserve to fail. (Sorry for the harsh words, but medical school is no joke). I don't know what kind of a student you are but I'm not much of a mugger of facts and I could never vomit information like some of my really accomplished classmates could do. My memory was based on association. If I remember things it had to be kind of a mind exercise. But I'm happy to say that those things that I studied then I still remember quite well. I used pictures, flowcharts and interactive softwares to help me associate things (circa 2002-03). Today you have the advantage of internet, so use it to the maximum to make your studying experience entertaining and educative at the same time. If you just mug up facts you will never remember things fondly or even remember it at all after your exam is done. Books Study the standard internationally recognized books. I find most Indian authors' books designed for students to mug and pass exams. They don't seem to inspire you or instill that sense of wonder. But some books are an exceptions to this rule as they are of international quality. I usually dislike notes (I have used them sometimes) as I feel I'm short changed on the whole picture and I'm a visual learner so I like all the props that come with the textbooks. So here goes my list of the must reads for any medical student in the world.Part IAnatomySnells- Such a beautiful book​​​​​​Physiology - Guyton or Ganong​​​​​​BiochemistryLippincott Again a wonderful book​​​​​​​​​​Part IIPathologyRobbins (preferably whole series) but at least medium Robbins.​​​​​​MicrobiologyAny other Microbiology book is going to be boring. ​​​​​​Paniker for Parasitology is one Indian book worth it's salt.​​​​​​Pharmacology You will fall in love with pharmacology with this book. ​​​​​​Forensic Medicine and Toxicology​​​​​​Part IIIPreventive and Social medicine.Don't look beyond ParkIt is a treatise you don't want to miss and you will know about India like you never knew before.​​​​​​OphthalmologyParson's- Not my favourite book now but it is certainly a great concise book.​​​​​​ENTAgain an Indian book worth reading​​​​​​​Internal MedicineIf you are not as brilliant as some of my classmates were, don't read Harrison's cover to cover and expect to revise before your exams. Remember that you have 4 subjects to study in final year, all of which are equally important and interesting.Dumber people like me loved better written books and we didn't do too badly.Davidson​​​​​​And Kumar and Clark​​​​​Use Harrison only as reference book and not as a regular book.​General SurgeryAn amazing book which is a case based approach to surgery.​​​​​​PediatricsOP Ghai's Essential Pediatrics is a masterpiece on the subject​​​​​​​OBGYNIndian obstreticians and gynaecologists have been the pioneers in this field so I would recommend two Indian books for the same.​​​​​​​​​​​These are just the minimum number of books for each subject and is only a very short list of books you should study. Medical science is inexhaustible of knowledge. There are many many more books that are beyond the scope of this answer and I leave it to your better judgement to choose wisely. Concentrate on high yield books when you are short of time (you always will be in medical school). At least I could never ever read enough for a test or an exam. There is always more to read.All I would say is to always make it interesting. Live the subject while you are studying it and you'll never regret it. I wish I could say I always felt like roses about studying medicine but I have had my own share of weak moments and let me tell you despite the wonder of medical science it will not be smooth sailing all the way. Several times I have broken down with the pressure of the sheer amount of knowledge that I am expected to hold. In my case I consider myself a very average student with average intelligence but hard work has got me where I am. Don't believe anyone who says hard work is not important.Sports and other stuffStudies need not be the only thing about medical school. For sports and other extra-curricular activities kept me busy as well as fresh. Sports took away a lot of the stress of medical school. Exercise releases endorphins in your body which decreases stress levels and improves cognitive memory.It improves your disipline in every aspect of your life. Take up at least one sport.Read more about it from this answer. Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to How is life as a medical student?PG exam coaching. I don't believe in PG coaching. Once you are a medical student things cannot be spoon fed. It is up to you to take charge. I agree some of these coaching institutes have some good study materials and also some good teachers but your success is decided by your personal dedication. There are some good teaching videos available online. Kaplan's USMLE teaching videos are especially great for clinical subjects even if you are not taking up USMLE. Even then it is only going to contribute less than 5 % of what it will take. If you were a dedicated medical student who is very good at his/her basics I don't think any medical PG entrance exam is going to daunt you.Experience with patientsThe most exciting part of MBBS is going to be your interaction with the patients. No matter how many books you read or how many lectures you attend you will never be as good as your professor at getting the diagnosis out of a patient's own mouth. It is certainly a work of art and a joy when you see it with your own eyes. I've seen many brilliant students who are very poor in people skills and hence they make poor doctors. Robert Hutchison's Clinical Methods is a great start to acquiring those soft skills.Sir Robert Hutchison, 1st Baronet​​​​​Robert Hutchison's two students Hamilton Bailey and McNeill Love co-wrote a surgical treatise named ""A short practice of Surgery"" (A wonderful book by the way) which is read by thousands of medical students worldwide.In it's first page there was a quote by William Osler, one of the founding doctors of Johns Hopkins Hospital.""He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all"" - William OslerI still keep that quote stuck to my table at my clinic. It reminds me each day that patients are my best teachers.For some non-academic medical reading you may find this answer useful.Raghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Yesterday's Bangalore's newspaper edition (31/03/2015) came with a supplement called Times Health where apparently they have done a full fledged survey on hospitals in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai. The survey was apparently comprehensive containing 3 modules i.e. desk research, factual survey and perceptual survey rating.​​​​​The survey was conducted by i3RC, a research consultancy firm.The survey's credibility falls flat on its face when I see the Eye Care hospital's ranking in Bangalore.​​​Three of the five hospitals ranked in the survey (see photo above) don't even have an ophthalmology department to speak of and obviously don't have high quality subspecialty care. They chose a few top hospitals in Bangalore and did a permutation-combination in the rankings. Very low quality survey. The TOI editorial team did not do their due diligence and published a flawed or fraudulent survey.These errorneous surveys ruin the public's perception.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I don't know whether this answer is too late for the guy asking this question but I think I was in a similar situation in the summer of 2008 when I wrote my first PG entrance. I had just finished internship in 2008. My moment of reckoning.Now a small back story. I spent most of my MBBS training for long distance running in the morning and play football till I dropped in the evening. I used to play for my college football team. So no daily study or weekends.  I enjoyed this life. I used to study when I needed to and managed to pass all my tests and  exams. I was getting though the years but was not really studying enough to excel in medicine. In final year I tried really hard to make up for all the lost years of study but I was still in the middle of my class (in my opinion). I somehow passed my final year exam with first class but I still was somewhere in the middle. I then spent my internship doing my job at the hospital and recreate when I was off duty. All this while my classmates studied whenever they got the time to study. After this extended holiday in my internship since I had not done any kind of studies for PG entrance, not surprisingly I did badly....it was then that it dawned on me that I was ruining my life without purpose. My classmates were well ahead of me on this competitive exam.I took drastic measures. Though I was from Bangalore I joined a coaching Centre in kottayam and rented a room living alone near the center. For the next 10 months I lived the life of a monk. Studied 10-12 hrs a day. Slept 6-7hrs a day. Took a half a day off on Sundays to see a movie or have a good dinner. Not both.Mondays again got back to business. It was me and my books. It was the most toughest part of my academic life but it was cathartic experience as well. This one year is that year which would define my life. I found inspiration sitting and studying in that room. I found what I truly wanted to do. I rediscoved my love for medicine. Last but not the least I found purpose in my life.I am a slow reader but I grasp concepts well even the first time. I had to put in more hours than my contemporaries to reach the same level. I still consider myself an average student. But what I had was determination and grit to make up for whatever gifts I did not have.In the end I got a very good rank in AIPGMEE 2009 and I was able to get into one of the best Ophthalmology residencies in the country (RIO- Kolkata). I found great mentors in my residency and did very well. I later found more mentors in fellowship and I'm presently at the cusp of starting a successful career.My classmates in medical college would have laughed had you told them I would get this far. Not bad for an average student huh?Marks and what others think of you will make you believe that you are not good enough to belong at the top. But that doesn't have to be true. Most important is to find passion in what you do. Only if you have passion will you be working hard enough to achieve what you want to. If you do it like a chore that needs to be done you may never be successful. Being average is no barrier to achievement and success. How much you are willing to work for the things you want is what determines your sucess. Be optimistic, be hopeful, bring positivity into your life and everything will fall into place.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Clearly you are not keen to come back to India. You repeatedly list out the things that you find are not conducive of your return. So this makes your choice very simple- Do not come back to India.Anything that makes you unhappy will make you regret later. Your career, your wife and kids are just as important as your parents. Do make them stakeholders of these complicated decisions. You definitely owe your parents a lot to have made you able to have a successful career in the US. It is unfortunate that globalization has changed how our family system works but that is how it is going to be in the future so I suggest you embrace this new world in much the same spirit as you have embraced your life in the US. I'm sure you have other family in India. People living in the same city as your parents. You could have your parents live near some of your other relatives who would be available in times of emergency or when something needs to be done. Having a family member nearby is invaluable. Old age homes are an option but there is a huge stigma associated with it. So it would depend on the mentality of your parents.My grandparents are 88 and 82 years old. My grandmother's mobility is restricted as she's functionally blind and my grandfather is not really in the pink of health. Three of their four children stay in the same city but they refuse to stay with any of them as their independence is very important to them. We have hired maids and other facilities for them, we visit them every week to check on them but yet we feel we cannot do full justice. We have some relatives who live close by to check on them during the week. As people are living longer lives, old age in urban India has become quite a challenge for all concerned. The challenges are compounded by the reality of globally moving population like yourself. There are no easy solutions, only appropriate compromises. Hang in there, Good luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Because money is a small reason to become a doctor. I would be lying if I told money is not at all important. I would definitely love to be better off financially than I am right now but the upsides of being a doctor is not something I want to give up for anything in the world and fortunately no amount of money can buy it.To demonstrate why I say so I will share with you my experience during my Ophthalmology residency. I call it the 3 miracles.3 miraclesThese 3 stories are what I call miracles not only for those patients but also how it changed my outlook towards my profession and when I finally realized how much difference I alone could bring to the world.Miracle 1: When I was ending the 1st yr of my residency, I had just started doing cataract surgeries independently and confidently. One day in the clinic a woman about 60 yrs of age entered who had mature cataracts in both eyes. In fact she was so blind that she had to be supported by 2 people into the clinic room. For all practical purposes she was totally handicapped. I examined her and did the workup and got her admitted. My boss gave me the opportunity to operate on her. I operated on both eyes just a week apart from each other. The day after I operated on the second eye I entered the wards early in the morning and observed the most beautiful sight in the world. That same patient who needed 2 people to support her everywhere was running around the wards excitedly laughing and talking to all the other patients. The patient and their relatives somehow knew I was the one who operated on her. They were so thankful to me that I was touched. That was the the most satisfying moment of my professional life until then.Miracle 2 : It was sometime during the second year of my residency. A 22 yr old woman came to our hospital. She had a condition called Congenital Blepharoptosis of one eye, where one of the eyelids cannot be lifted like the other hence creating an asymmetry in her facial features. Its not a life-threatening or a significant visual handicap but it made an unsightly appearance due to which she was not getting married. Lot of hospitals had refused to operate on her saying its a cosmetic problem and was finally referred to my institute since its a govt institute and the patient was poor. I personally took up the case and worked it up and my boss as he has always done entrusted me with the operation. I operated on her and the operation was a huge success and it improved her appearance manifold. Shewas discharged and I had almost forgotten about it. Then one day about 5 months later when I was seeing patients in the clinic, that woman with her father had searched the whole hospital looking for me and finally found me in the clinic. They had come to invite me to her wedding which was fixed after the operation. This was such a humbling experience. That day I realised that no problem of the patient is small and that we have so much power to change their lives if we show empathy to their woes.Miracle 3 : I was in my final year of residency and was working in a retina unit. A depressed young woman walked into our clinic. She had a painful blind eye which needed to be removed. She had an unsightly eye since childhood due to an accident and was very depressed with how it looked. I wanted to remove the eye and have an artificial prosthesis fitted so that it looked like a normal eye. My present boss was not that enthusiastic since in government hospitals due to the high case loads, they often remove a painful eye and leave it like that without thinking of the social stigma it may cause. And being a retina surgeon he was not sure whether it would turn out well. But I persisted and finally convinced him to admit that patient. I operated on that eye and fitted an implant and prosthesis. It was a success. In 2 months time she had a prosthetic eye and nobody looking at her from far away would have realised she did not have an eye. Even my boss who was skeptical initially was very impressed. I was travelling in the metro train after work one evening and that woman and her husband approached me there. I almost didn't recognize them. Both of them were looking so happy and they were so grateful. I wish I could have captured their joy in my camera but couldn't. This was the best gift I could get for all the effort I took to get her operated ""properly"": HER SMILE.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Contact lens solutions are as much a fraud as Pepsi and Coca Cola are a fraud.The contact lens solution companies sell what they advertise. The manufacturing cost is immaterial because when you buy a Coca Cola you are paying 20 times the manufacturing cost but it still won't stop you from buying it. In much the same way contact lens solution companies like Bauch & Laumb and Johnson & Johnson sell their brand value and at the same time sell convenience.The pills that is mentioned in the question details are a reminder to an older era when hard contact lenses were in vogue and the pills were enzymes which served as protein removal agents from the hard contact lenses. These days, the contact lens solutions have the enzymes, anti-bacterial agents, anti-fungal agents and osmotic agents. This keeps the soft contact lens adequately rehydrated and at the same time prevents infection of the eyes. No one uses pills anymore becauseIt is a lot of workMost of the people use soft contact lenses these days.It is easier to buy a solution from the store whose sterility is almost guaranteed than worry about making tap water sterile.Everything you buy on the market is sold at a price way more than it really costs but that is how a business works. The companies will charge you what you are willing to pay. Contact lenses and it's solutions are not some life saving drugs.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I belong to the grandfather style of reading books and for the longest time I believed that physical books was the only way to read books- textbooks and others. I used to scoff at anyone using ebooks to study and read. But modern technology has a way to creep into our lifestyles. I was already using my iPad to read PDFs of scientific papers, textbooks and academic articles. But I was actively avoiding a  proper e-book reader with e-ink technology for the longest time.That changed this July when my wife gifted me my first kindle- Paperwhite (2015 ed.). I've been using it for 3 months now and I'm now a total convert. These are few of my observationsThe letters are crisp and don't look like digital font. I like the new Bookerly font though I've not used any other font to compare in detail.The pages look and feel is paper-like. I would say I don't miss paper at all except for the smell of fresh books. Unlike my iPad which I had to charge every 2-3 days, the paperwhite, I only have to charge about once in a month. I use my kindle for about 2-3 hours a day.The backlight is awesome because you can read with the lights off and there in no glare at all. It is easier to sleep after reading from the kindle. Staring at bright screens causes your biological clock to go haywire (Bright Screens Could Delay Bedtime). Shopping experience on Amazon store is excellent. You can buy in mobile, computer or directly from the kindle...eBooks are cheaper than paperbacks and most titles are available in kindle format. Subscribe to  some websites like PixelofInk.com  and Bookbub.com and you'll get many free eBooks and good deals in many others. From my experience the good and latest titles are difficult to come by in the deal section.Calibre is a useful free software to convert all non-kindle formats to mobi or azw formats. I only have to just email any document directly to my kindle id and WiFi will automatically update my kindle library.One hack I've learnt is that no matter what format the eBook is in, when you email the book to your kindle id, putting ""convert"" in the subject line will convert it to azw format. I've tried it with PDF and epub and this is very useful since this way I don't need to use Calibre.The number of non-academic books I have read has increased since I started using the kindle. I average about 3 books a month now. Pre- Kindle I was more like 1 book in 6 months.The Kindle app is very useful to have in my smart phone and it serves me one specific purpose which I'll detail in my next point. Initially I was having problems for my academic purposes. All scientific papers come in PDF format and not in the kindle format. The direct PDF page rendering is a chore. The enlarging and pinch function of the kindle is not very responsive. when you convert PDFs to kindle formats the graphs,tables and figures go haywire. I have found a simple way around this problem.When PDF is converted to azw format, the text is more or less spared from any formatting if it is not a scanned copy. So I email the PDF file twice to my kindle id- once with ""convert"" in subject line and one without. So now I have both PDF and azw format in my kindle. There is simultaneous syncing of all files in the cloud. I read the text from my kindle and look up the graphs and tables in my cell phone. This way I can spare the battery of my cell phone from draining out while I'm reading. I'm especially proud of this hack.In summary, I'm a very happy customer. My reading has increased-both academic as well as non-academic (fiction and non-fiction). I'm hardly using my iPad now and the kindle along with some support from my cell phone is doing the job for me. Generally, over the last several years, my online consumption of information has greatly increased compared to printed material like newspapers, magazines, textbooks, journals etc. This has been possible because of the many news & magazine apps, digitization of even academic content and improvement of internet. So now it is cheaper, convenient and more efficient to access information. I think embracing new technology like the Kindle is the way to go!PS: I do hope Amazon is working on making PDFs a little better reading experience than it is now.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I have an issue with the fact that a single exam is used to assess one's ability to become a doctor in India. One not only has to study but also has to battle finances, reservations and discouraging people throughout the study period. It is really unfair that one's career is stuck at a bottle neck called entrance exam. But then again not many things are fair in this world. I got through this bottleneck but I don't think I was any better than the rest of the people writing the exam. Maybe I was luckier and maybe I was hungrier than the rest I can never say. You can read my answer to the following question and gauge that I was really a plain Jane of the medical profession.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Can an average medical student get a clinical pg seat in government colleges?There is often the misconception that successful people never see failure. Often times we observe that some people have everything work out for them and everything falls in place. But most successful people are something like this duck below​When I first started studying for my exams I met so many seniors studying for the last 3-4 years telling me one will never get a rank in AIPGMEE in the first year of study. I realized that the people who have already got a rank on first attempt will not be around to discourage the juniors and they would be doing their residency. These negative seniors are the people one should avoid like plague. Most successful people will never tell you this: ""How hard I work to get what I want.""I know of a lot of people who work hard but don't do well in the exam. Outside the exam scenario you ask them any question and they have the answer. Its just that they go into the exam thinking they've already lost the game and that is what is the most important. I'm sure all the people who keep writing exam after exam year after year suffer from this syndrome. Again this is highly unfair but that is how it is.When you are pushed against the wall you get the most private moment in your life. You for the first time get to introspect on your life and mull on your priorities. I feel that one year I spent studying for my entrance absolutely changed the way I approached life. I realized that I would never let an exam define my worth and that lesson was to hold me good stead in all the exams I took.One has to understand that getting a PG seat is not the end all of everything. Once you get into residency, you just start on the next challenge before you. Hence just because you did not get a PG seat that does not mean the end of the road. There are so many career choices one has. It is important to prioritize what you want and how you will use your opportunities .If you are adamant that you cannot see yourself as anything but a doctor treating patients be willing to put in the hours and also never to go into any exam thinking there will be another exam after this. Every exam you write has to be written as the last entrance exam you will ever write.But then if you confront yourself and ask yourself ""Is that really what I want?"" you might get an answer you might be dreading but it maybe the answer you should be listening to.One doctor gave me this advice and I think it changed the way I used to think:""Don't wallow in self-pity because frankly no one except your parents cares about you. If you want to be a doctor who matters you can't be mediocre. The world belongs to  people who strive for excellence. If you are striving for anything less then you are wasting your time.""It sounds a little harsh now but it was something I needed to hear. Before this I used to crib that I'm stuck here after MBBS and blaming everyone from my parents to all of my friends for my condition. Once I changed my attitude everything changed. Positive attitude makes up for a lot of bad luck and misfortune.Last but not the least is that you should find wonder in the things that you study in medicine or you will never appreciate it enough to want it as badly.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I don't usually like to answer these kind of non specific questions. But  Roman Saini has given a very lopsided view of the scene. His answer is like quoting CEOs salaries in India to represent the salaries of all software engineers in India.The question is as Roman pointed out quite vague and a doctor's salary can vary depending on place of work, government or private employment, the type of specialization, clinical acumen and skills of the doctor.Private hospitals in India typically pay less than 10% of the revenue a single doctor can generate. So for a doctor to earn Rs. 12 crore per annum, the amount of revenue that needs to be generated per year is Rs. 100 crore plus. I doubt many hospitals in India can generate this kind of revenue from a single doctor.If only talking about salaried doctors and not hospital owners, salaries can vary from Rs. 10,000 to 1 crore a month. But  median salary for each level of specialization is:Post MBBS- Rs. 10,000 to 40,000/month (5.5 years of training)Post MD/MS - Rs. 30,000 to 2,00,000/ month ( 9-12years of training)Post DM/Mch/Fellowship - Rs. 50,000 to 3,00,000/month. (12-15 years of training)Some doctors don't get paid at all when they are training in a hospital imparting training. The hospitals trade free labour for imparting training to doctors.Some of my doctor friends who are working in primary health centers in villages get paid once in 6 months and no one including the government could be bothered about it.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Medicine and Healthcare: Why do Indian doctors refuse to work in villages?I'm from a family of Indian doctors. I'm a doctor and my father, uncles, aunts and cousins are all doctors. We have had a comfortable life and a good education because we live in professional based family. Doctors making Rs 12 crore per annum is almost unheard of. Atleast I don't know anyone who does.Money is the wrong way to look at Medicine. The investments- financial, emotional, time- that goes into becoming a doctor will never be adequately compensated. A doctor who is more than average is capable of making more money in another field in less time, with less effort and a lot less stress. Those who succeed in this profession are usually passionate about it.Doctors making more than Rs. 200k/month comprise of less than 5% of all doctors in India. That said, if a doctor in India makes a modest Rs. 2,00,000 /month, he can lead a relatively comfortable life in any part of India.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I want to tell my small story about reading.When we were kids me and my brother would accompany our mom to our ancestral home in our native village during our summer holidays.During those days (early 90s) we didn't have cable connection on TV (like in our city home). Only form of entertainment was radio, running across the fields and both us brothers beating the crap out of each other.Until my cousin who was a college lecturer gave me her library card for the village library.I borrowed a cycle and rode 5 km to the library everyday to take 2 books that could be allotted to that card. I did that for a week. But I was too fast a reader to be satiated with 2 books a day. So I decided the most efficient way would be to sit in the library from 10am to 4pm and get 2 books home for the night and start all over again next day. The librarian was very kind and he let me read almost all the books he had. After 2 weeks he finally told me...why don't you take a week's worth of books with the card? Anyway no one else reads these books. So I was just waiting for this opportunity which seemed to appear from heaven. I stacked up two huge stacks of books. The librarian had to hire a cycle rickshaw to get the books back home. He accompanied me to my home. My mom was waiting at the door and was shocked at the number of books I had got.He told my mom that in 22 years on his job he had not seen a single person finish all the books in his library. Please find this boy a bigger library when you get back to Bangalore.This is how amazing the love of books is. I wish I could explain it in a few words but it always seems impossible to do that. Twenty years down the line my hunger for the written word remains insatiable. The unintended (at least in my case) yet positive aspect of reading is that when you enjoy it, over time you become extremely well informed about current world issues and have a modern outlook and logical opinion on most topics. This gets you into any conversation with all kinds of people and that is a huge advantage in life.Your kid seems to belong to my tribe. Nurture that passion.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I guess the phenomenon you are describing is this image. ​​​​​Interesting question because when I was a kid I used to think it is bacteria and viruses that I'm seeingBut it's not.Our eyes cannot see microscopic organisms. The blanket term for them are eye floatersEye floaters is one of three things in the path of light before it reaches the retina:Tear film debris or RheumVitreous floatersRetinal pigmentsRheumThis is basically the hardened mucus secretions usually found on waking up, this gets mixed with the tear film and these are refractile materials hence form these formations when it comes in the line of vision.These are temporary and usually go away after sometime without any intervention.Vitreous floatersThese are the more permanent kind. It is commonly known as eye floaters or muscae volitantes (""flying flies"") in Latin or mouches volantes (in French). Some of these floaters if you keep paying attention to it seems like a housefly is trapped inside your eye. This is pretty normal. I'll try to explain how that happens.The eye is filled with a gel like material  called vitreous humour which serves as an medium for light to reach the retina. ​​This vitreous humour is composed of collagen (Type II fibrillar collagen protein) and other wide array crystalloid proteins like Hyaluronic acid, glycosaminoglycans etc.It is composed of mainly water but along with these proteins forms a viscous gel like material which fills up the eye. The collegen in the vitreous are arranged in the form of fibrils​​​It is these microscopic clumped fibrils that casts a shadow over the retina which the individuals see as eye floaters​Retinal pigmentsThe electrical charges in the collagen fibrils usually keep the collagen from excessive clumping and maintains the gel form. As one ages the electrical charges reduce and the clumping increases and the gel becomes more liquid state. This causes the vitreous to collapse on itself. This then further causes the vitreous from detaching from the Retina.This is known as posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). ​​​​This PVD causes many kinds of floaters like cobwebs, thread-like strands, ring shadows, etc. These are still harmless and once you stop paying attention to it, you hardly notice it.Sometimes along with the posterior vitreous detachment some part of the Retina also gets torn​​​​This causes a new type of floaters from the retinal pigment particles released into the vitreous cavity. It may be noticed by the individuals as blackish or grayish spots on movement of the eye. Age and high myopia are risk factors for this to happen.The retinal tears may progress to retinal detachment causing vision loss. This is a pretty serious condition and needs surgical intervention.Of the three types of floaters the last one is the most serious. Hence any new onset floaters should warrant a visit to your Ophthalmologist to rule out retinal tear or detachment.​Image sources:http://www.doctor-hill.com/patie...http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu...http://www.azonano.com/article.a...https://discoveryeye.org/blog/po...Thanks for the A2A Sahaj",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Are you talking about the small amounts of crusty or semisolid material at the inner corners of your eyes when you wake up? I believe you are talking about what is colloquially known as ""eye boogers""It is called Rheum. It is a natural physiological process that happens in all animals including humans. The Rheum is mainly of Mucus and fat secretion called mebum secreted by the Meibomian glands of the eye mixed with skin cells, dust, sweat, skin oils etc.Mebum is secreted by the Meibomian glands of the eye wich are present in both eyelids:​​​You can even see it in infrared light when the eyelid is everted​​​​This mebum forms one of the three layers of your tear film known as the lipid layer. This layer prevents the evaporation of the tears from your eyes and keeping your eyes wet.​​Basically the mucus and mebum along with dust, skin, skin oils, etc then dries up during sleep when it settles down at the corners of the eyes. Small amounts of Rheum on waking up is normal enough but when the crusting increases to such an extent that the eyelashes are matted and it is difficult to open your eyes then it could be indicative of infection or allergy or blockage of the tear duct. At that time one would be best advised to consult an Ophthalmologist.Image sources:Meibomian gland disease (MGD) (Evaporative dry eyes)http://www.focusetop.com/index.p...What is Dry Eye?Thanks for the A2A Abinav Ravi Athreya",high,high,high,low,low

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"It is a myth that doctors need to be emotionally detached towards their patients. Of course we need to see things from an objective viewpoint not coloured with emotion but I never believed in being cold towards my patients. They need your expertise as well as your empathy in equal measure.In all my years in the medical profession I have never managed to be emotionally detached towards any of my patients. I'm personally invested in each of my patients even if they are not with me. In my opinion, this is the primal difference between a doctor and a multitude of other professions. If one is not interested in the personal well being of their patients then he/she is treating it like a business where they are trying to maximize the returns on investment.That version is not for me.I worry about my patients all the time. Once they enter my cabin they are my responsibility. Even when they ignore my advice- patients often do- I'm still worried about them. Even when they agree with me, I'm doubly careful to repeat my instructions so that they follow instructions properly.When I successfully perform a complicated surgery I'm worried about the post operative course for the patient. Even when I do the near-perfect surgery, I still worry but a little less. Then when I have had a complication during surgery and even if I manage to fix it somehow- I've gone entire nights without sleep- terribly worried and feeling guilty at the same time!There are inherent joys to treating your patients like one's own family member- which I do always. When you truly make a difference to their lives you have achieved what you set out to do as a doctor. A patient's gratitude towards you when you have helped them is immeasurable in monetary terms. This for me is more important than all the stress I have to endure for the same. That is my reward- probably my return of investment.I pursued my residency in a government hospital in Kolkata and faced many of the problems that you describe in the question details. Despite pursuing my residency in a premier institute like Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Kolkata- we often faced lacunae in care because of government apathy, the sheer volume of patients we had to take care of and the shortage of resources. I was often moved and disturbed at the same time due to this.I was exposed to the abject poverty of patients in West Bengal which is much more grave than in Karnataka- my home state. It was tough for me to handle initially but gradually I learnt how to give efficient care to the appropriate patients. I learnt to listen to patients problems (not necessarily health related) to help them make the right decisions for their situations. I tried to reduce their hospital spending by effective means. I sometimes went to great lengths to convince my superiors to take timely decisions. It was a great management lesson for which I did not need to go to a B-school to learn. In the end I found that if you truly care for your patients, have empathy towards their varied problems and have respect towards them you will find a way to help them in the best possible way.The best examples have been described in my own blog post below which I wrote during my residency.3 miraclesI want to share three stories duringmy residency in which I was instrumental in somebody's happiness and which brings immense satisfaction to me.These 3 stories are what i call miracles not only for those patients but also how it changed my outlook towards my profession.Miracle 1 : When i was ending the 1st yr of my residency, I had just started doing cataract surgeries independently and confidently.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I don't like giving free personalized medical advice. This is because when you don't pay for something it really has no value.If it is about generic advice a friend/ family/ relative/ aquaintance is asking about some life related issue I would offer my opinion. In that too I would temper my advice in relation to how close that person is to me. I never ever give unsolicited advice-even though it is free.As for professional medical advice. This calls on my expertise. Though I consider myself to be knowledgeable about a variety  of the things, medical knowledge is among my core knowledge and it comes at a price however small. If it is family or close friends I may waive my own fees. Others have to pay to get my services.

From Nixon- Kissinger administration to Clinton administration were openly allying with dictatorial leaderships of Pakistan- Zia-Ul-Haq to Musharraf. With so much security threat from Pakistan it was imperitive that India develop some active deterents against attacking India. The USA point-blank denied the Pakistan involvement in the 1993 Bombay bomb blasts- the evidence of Pakistan involvement was all too apparent right from the start. Despite that the Clinton administration were actively trying to stop India's Nuclear Program- Diplomatically and Economically. Under these circumstances India had to continue it's Nuclear program on its own and in heavy secrecy. The US spy satilities and the CIA was keeping watch over India's activities leading up to the tests.When India finally conducted the Nuclear tests- Pokaran II in 1998, the Clinton administration enforced many sanctions on India and forced it's other allies too to enforce sanctions and criticize India's tests. Clearly it did not go down well with Uncle Sam. All US grandstanding went to zilch when their ally Pakistan had their first Nuclear tests just two weeks after the Indian tests. Pakistan had a secret nuclear weapons program from the late 1970s after India's  'Smiling Buddha' operation or Pokaran I in 1974 right under the nose of the US. Either that or US was passively helping Pakistan in their nuclear program. China too was helping Pakistan with Nuclear and missile programs.So the bottom line was that it was not USA's choice to make. India did it despite them.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I have been a veteran of the anti-reservation part of my country for many years now. So if a label is be put on me, I am strongly anti-reservation and I believe reservation is a flawed policy which has not changed the social dynamics in India. If we are still talking about castes 60+ years since reservation first started then we have achieved nothing to reduce the barriers in was supposed to take care of.Read on if you want to keep an open mind and don't want to listen to the useless rants from both sidesAs much as I respect Haribabu Thilakar's point of view-and many of his arguments are valid points- I disagree that anti-reservation is empty rhetoric to further perpetuate caste inequalities. I'm not casteist and I can say that with full conviction. I am anti-reservation. Casteism and Anti-reservation are not synonymousFirst let me start with a small story sketched and narrated beautifully by Toby Morris about ""class privilege"". I don't think anyone could have done it better than he has.​​​​​​​​​​http://thewireless.co.nz/article...If you've got the moral out of the above story, you would realize that class privilege is the real deal here in India and people from higher castes do get a social advantage from being privileged in the first place. It is not only about money. That is a given.For example, I am formally educated because I come from a family of professionals which includes lawyers, doctors and bankers. I may not have economic privilege in the form of excessive wealth but I have a social pedigree to match up to. A culture of expectation. This culture of expectation is missing in many groups/communities in India because the main aim of the parents in these families to feed them food first. We do have to acknowledge that.So now Reservation makes sense right? To an extent yes, but mostly NO!Because there is a false equivalence here:""Lower caste"" does not necessarily mean ""lower social opportunities"" to get forward.or ""Higher caste"" does not necessarily mean ""higher social opportunities"" too.You see I'm not talking about economy at all here.Reservation NepotismSo you have seen bureaucrats/doctors/lawyers/politicians/ government servants of the earlier era who have utilized the same reservation system to get economically, socially and politically forward. Yet the same people use the same system to give their kids a jump start ahead than the rest of the population and also more deserving people in their own community. This is where the reservation system comes apart.Unlimited reservation till death and beyondConcept of giving reservation even after undergraduation- Post-graduate, PhD., government jobs and other caste based perks despite not needing any it.As an example I'll talk about medical education which is something I know about:Currently there is reservation on entering medical school (18 categories of reservation when I took up MBBS). All my classmates studied the same books (books for SC/ST is provided free of cost) wrote the same exams and became doctors on equal footing. But reservation does not end there!It continues on for entrance exams for Government residency slots and even for recruitment in government hospitals after MBBS or residency. So when is this medical student actually becoming officially forward in the government's eyes?Once a student gets into medical school and completes it, he is socially and financially uplifted from backwardness (at least that's the theory). Once in Internship, a medical student from reserved category has received the same education and opportunities as a medical student from the general category so this system of unlimited reservation till death is spoiling the meritocracy and increasing frustration among others.Nearly 50% of the residency slots in central government institutes are in the reserved category and those claiming them are not necessarily backward. This reservation game continues beyond residency even into recruitment after residency. It is so ludicrous that in an apex institute like AIIMS to get hired you need to be either an OBC/SC/ST candidate or a minister should recommend you (which if you didn't guess already is recruited in the general category).  So you don't see the best talent in the country in the Apex government health institute because the yardstick set is not the one conducive for attracting talent. I have had many classmates who made ample use of this loophole no one is bothered enough to fix. You see what's happening here? If not, read that animated strip again and get back.This unlimited reservation is class privilege played out in reverse. So you are perpetuating the same evil that reservation was supposed to eliminate. You are giving a huge advantage to that small class of people over the rest of the population who got the same opportunities and who worked just as hard or harder.Lines that divideLike Bhuvi Jain mentioned, I don't need my caste for any useful purpose in my life other than to differentiate me from this supposed other group. That too is just useful for the government and not me. Some may point out that not needing to know my caste is a class privilege- I accept that. But if the government is really aspiring to an egalitarian society and a classless society, why should they draw lines using caste in the first place? Why would I be required to specify my caste everywhere in every government form or document? How are we supposed to remove these class divides if the government keeps insisting that they need to put us in baskets of their choosing?Why do they divide us with lines that we don't want to exist?What should be done?There are no easy answers to those. There are no quick fixes for complex problems like poverty, education, healthcare,etcEducation cannot be a zero sum game. They cannot just say that we have made people equal by giving them reservation when they get out of school.The real challenge is to get them to school and make them stay there and we have nothing to show there! Haribabu also mentioned about the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE) - It is an admirable social experiment and I was really rooting for it when it was in the implementation stage but now I'm not so sure. I had a chat recently with my house maid who sends her kid under the RTE rules to a posh school in Bangalore. She isn't happy and says her kid isn't happy too. Going to that school just keeps highlighting the class difference to them everyday despite the education being free and funded for. It doesn't give them aspiration. Being sad is not the purpose of going to school, so somehow I don't think we are tackling the problem where we should. In summary:In my opinion, Reservation cannot solve inequality or fight casteism. Two wrongs cannot make a right. That is a stand of Anti-Reservation. It is not casteism. Period.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Lee Kuan Yew (LKY) will remain a great leader even if he wasn't the most popular leader outside Singapore.If one has to appreciate the work that was done by him one has to live in Singapore for sometime like I had the opportunity to. I lived in Singapore for about a year and that gave me the opportunity to examine why Singapore was so successful.  Coming from a country like India which got independence much earlier than Singapore it is just incredible how he converted a third world country to a first world in a single generation. This kind of feat is not matched by any leader in world history.Of course he did not do it alone. There were other leaders too. Also LKY crushed his rivals and was not kind to dissent in his own party or even others. He ruled Singapore with an iron hand. This might seem untenable to a European or American but Singapore needed that kind of a leader in 1965. Otherwise it would have slowly degenerated into a banana republic like Zimbabwe or Myanmar. He was the leader that Singapore needed. When I lived in Singapore I was saddened by how India could have been as developed if not for populist and socialist Congress Party. Jawaharlal Nehru could not for all his greatness become as great a leader as LKY. Far worse he left a poor legacy in Indira Gandhi and her dynastic politics to send India into political and economic ruin. Where did India miss the bus when we got our independence in 1947? The difference was the vision that LKY had for his country which none of our Indian leaders had. As examples I would just mention 3 instances of his great vision. There are many more but these are instances which stand out for me.1. Drinking water IndependenceDuring the world war II,  Singapore was offering strong resistance to the Japanese invasion and even destroyed the bridge connecting Malaysia to Singapore. Japanese cut off their water supply from Malaysia and Singapore surrendered within three days. This may seem inconsequential but LKY took a lesson from this and built the Marina Barrage where water flowing into the sea was collected in a dam like entrapment. In 20 years time the salt water reservoir became drinking water and now Singapore is completely self sufficient in fresh water requirement. Some would have called LKY a mad man then but now you can't hear anyone laughing2. Public TransportSingapore got it's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) in 1987 and India got it's first Metro in 1984 in Kolkata. Today singapore has one of the best and affordable forms of public transport in the world and India is struggling even in the biggest cities to provide any semblence of good public transport. To see how we in India literally missed the bus we have to realize that one had to wait till 2007 to see a Delhi metro materialize and we still haven't seen the Bangalore metro become a reality anytime soon. We were 20 years too late.3. Human capital.LKY realized quite early that he was not going to achieve much without any natural resources so he made Singapore the point of business for all of Asia. He created human capital. He made English one of the four official languages and that gave Singapore linguistic currency to deal with the west. He did business with everyone who gave them business. China, Malaysia, North Korea, Myanmar....it did not matter. That was a very astute move for a small country to improve economy as well as avoid war from neighboring countries.My admiration for LKY stems from the way he built a country from nothing and which now has one of the fastest growing economies and a strong currency. Few Singaporeans today want to settle down in another country but many in India are dying to get out of their country....and that says a lot about LKY as a leader and statesman and how far Singapore has come since 1965.Edit: Since the time I have written this answer many Indians here have taken exception that I chose to compare Singapore to India saying it is not a fair comparison. The intention was not to belittle India or to stargaze at Singapore. The following link may help say how these two countries had huge potential and yet took on different paths. Also this is a recent article and my answer is not based on this article. Just thought it was appropriate to add to make my point clearer.Lessons for India from Singapore",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"House is probably the worst doctor you can possibly get treated by. He's rude, arrogant, misogynist, insensitive, egoistic, arrogant, a drug addict, borderline Asperger's and most importantly he does not speak or examine his patients. I watched House with great interest when I was an intern and was quite taken in by the show. Who doesn't like an abrasive genius who always gets things right and always gets his way even when he is wrong? Once I started residency I realized that the show was a sham. Doctors like that cannot exist and if they do they would be mediocre doctors if at all. Patients are not computers which can behave predictably. As a concept it is as abstract as String theory.The art of medicine is not acquired by 'feeling the knowledge' but more by seeing what the patient requires of you. We spend nearly a lifetime understanding the patient's version of disease and treating what needs to be treated. For this to happen there needs to be a connection between the Patient and the Doctor and that never happens with House. A patient has to trust you to let you know the most intricate details of his or her life. To have the privilege of being entrusted to touch and examine a patient is not something to be taken very lightly. Treating patients is based on extensive history and physical examination and not solely on what is written in textbooks.I hold this quote by the great William Osler very close to heart because I know it is true.""He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all"" - William OslerI wouldn't trust any of my personal details with a doctor such as House or his minions.If ever I look up to a genius doctor that would be Dr. MD Ravi, my Paediatrics Professor from my medical School- JSS Medical College, Mysore. Experiencing his genius, we were all sure that he was not from this planet. He was a legend long before I became a medical student. His clinical case discussions were filled with all the makings of a potboiler. His vast knowledge on any subject in medicine or outside was unparalleled. This included the perfect rendition of  Lord Tennyson's ""The Charge of the Light Brigade"".  These classes were so popular that medical students from all over Mysore (Mysore has 2 medical colleges) used to flock to them and we would have people hanging from classroom windows to catch his words. Boy was that fun. A doctor is a product of compassion and not bookish knowledge.He inspired nearly half my class to take up Paediatrics as a specialty. This genius was not only the product of knowledge alone but that personal care and compassion he had towards his patients- the little ones. I still remember his monologues berating parents regarding their poor feeding habits which was detrimental to the children. He was prepared to be unpopular with parents so that their kids would get better nutrition and hence get better. A golden rule I never forget when I treat kids - if provided good nutrition a lot of childhood illnesses have better outcomes. As an intern, I saw him personally attend to patients all night when he was senior enough to delegate others to do the job. When he was elevated to the post of Vice- Principal in our medical college, he was sad and lamented the fact that now he would be so burdened with administrative work that he would spend less time with his patients.  He inspired us to be better doctors in more ways than one.I met him a few years back when I visited my medical college hospital and I saw him walking fast across the hospital. I wished him thinking he wouldn't even remember me. (Even some of my classmates must have forgotten me:-)) He stopped, looking at me and then a smile of recognition flashed across his face. He then asked me, "" Hi Raghuraj. What are you up to these days?""I felt like the most important person in the world. He always showed us that the people and their interactions was at the center of a medical practice. He was the epitome of personalized medicine and that is the kind of doctor I want to be.If you are interested or intrigued about Dr. Ravi, here is a short biography of him from very close quarters- his son- who was my junior in medical college.Dr . M.D. Ravi – redefining awesomenessNot so humble beginnings:Being the grandson of the chief minister in the court of the mysore maharaja , Dr. Ravi wasn’t exactly born into squalor . Nestled snugly within silken sheets in one of the vast bedrooms of what is now, the ever so popular, hotel atria Dr. ravi was introduced to this world and vice versa . Legend now has it that Dr. Ravi did his own apgar score at birth . If ever there was a testament to home deliveries Dr. Ravi seems to be it, first stepping into a hospital a good 3 months after being born . Thus began the journey that led to the making of one of the most highly respected medical professionals of todayGold rush:From Bangalore , Dr. Ravi was whisked away to kolar gold fields , where he would spend the next 18 years of his life , a period which was filled with scientific curiosity and boyhood merriment . forever accompanied by his trusty pet snake ( named tiffy ) and a rustic set of friends who were allergic , even anaphylactic , to the insides of a classroom , content to learn from books and experience . Dr. Ravi spent his childhood lost in the embrace of a multitude of books , the beginning of an ardent love for books ,which continues to afflict him to this day . A passionate orator , his legendary speaking skills made him a favourite in the debating circuits and these skills still stay with him today as any malnourished patients attender will vouch for .Finishing his schooling in kgf , where he was known more for his extra academic skills rather than his academic ones , Dr. Ravi went on to do his Bsc.Primarily as he was too young to be eligible for the mbbs course . Following this , Dr. Ravi again found himself with a good 8 months before he could apply for Mbbs , in the ensuing period he extensively honed his billiard skills and successfully obtained a truck drivers licence. Finally , Dr. M.D. Ravi walked into the halls of Kasturba medical college , a place he would call home for the next 10 years , and medicine was never the same againMove over henry gray , there s a new kid in town:As Dr. ravi meshed into his preclinical world , the cosmic forces around KMC felt a vibrant disturbance , as if the forces of medicine had felt a vast presence , namely the entry of a sentient being , a higher conscious . It truly seemed as if Dr. ravi was born to be a doctor as he brushed away mighty books such as Grays and Guyton with ease , books that ,to this day, cause many a medical student to experience vasomotor syncopy. Rumoured to have read the 35th edition of grays anatomy 36 times (as opposed to the average student who reads 35 pages of the 40th edition of grays ), Dr.ravi was an anatomy honours student who in his final exam accurately ‘side identified’ a metacarpal . Dr. Ravi continued to be a brilliant student , setting records in terms of marks , teaching post graduate students as an under grad and perennially sitting in the library with an archaic textbook in front of him . It was rumoured that the librarian usually sought Dr. Ravi’s help when he was looking for a misplaced book . Finishing mbbs with utter ease Dr. Ravi went on to finish his internship in Bangalore medical college and opted for an additional 6 months of residency in the department of surgery at St. Johns hospital where many an anaesthesiologist was forced to stand on a stool to accommodate for his tall lanky frame .Finally after this period Dr. Ravi found his true passion in paediatrics and opted to pursue it as his chosen field . A decision ,that till this date , has affected the lives of thousands of children who owe their lives to him and has also affected the lives of thousands of parents who still cringe whenever they think of Dr. Ravi and his fabled ‘ soppu – tarakari ‘ speech .Even though he was solicited by premier institutions across the country , such as AIIMS , Dr. Ravi chose to stick to his alma mater and completed his post graduation at KMC being only the second student in the history of pediatrics to get a distinctionDr. M.D. Ravi : the maestro of murmursForever being passionate about teaching , Dr. Ravi began his teaching career at MS Ramiah where he was known for being an exceptionally knowledgable and perennially cool assistant professor working with the energy of a post graduate and being easily approachable , a reputation that follows him to this day The Dr. Ravi that we see today , standing tall in the wards , teaching students , treating children with sheer joy and utmost patience , smiling his trademark grin at every person who stops by and takes a minute to wish him , tirelessly examining each case and still bursting with energy at the end of the day Is but a thin slice of the intricate being that he is . A mere milestone in a path that is studded by accomplishments that men can only hope to dream , a path that is far from being completeDr.Ravi : inspiration personifiedAs this writer can personally vouch for , as can countless others who worked under Dr. Ravi before him and countless others who shall have the fortune of doing so In the future , Dr. Ravi is truly an inspiration , both in terms of self as well as in belief .Dr. M.D. Krishna Narayanandigging through my laptop , i stumbled... - Krishna NarayananThis is the link to his profile in my college websiteJSS Medical College and Hospital, Mysore",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The more appropriate term for Forensic Medicine is Medical Jurisprudence. These are few of the reasons why I think it contributes to medical education.It is quite important  for a future doctor to know about Law in Medicine and how it applies in real life situations. Often many doctors don't fully understand the nitty gritties of informed consent and patients may be short changed due to that. There are many such laws that doctors are often ignorant about and land up in trouble.Doctors should know their rights such as the right to refuse a patient and many other important rights. In the same breath they should understand their duties as a physician and rights of patients patients as well.Watching autopsies performed live is an experience not to be missed by any medical student. Many doctors in remote villages are expected to conduct an autopsy on their own because of shortage of forensic experts to man every town.Much of the curriculum in Forensic Medicine seems non-intuitive such as knowing about calotropis or datura poisoning. But in a country like India, these are common poisons used in villages to kill people off. In the same way, knowledge about snakes, which ones are poisonous and the measures one has to take when a person is bitten is invaluable in a village set up. It may not make much sense in cities but let me tell you it is important since 70% of our population is rural.Many doctors don't know how to compile a medical report and how a law machinery works in cases of rape, murder child abuse,grevious hurt and sometimes criminal negligence. Their word as expert witness is often called upon in our courts. They need to be prepared for that.Understanding how addictive drugs like cannabis, cocaine, morphine work on humans is important even in a regular medical practice.Vicarious liability, therapeutic misadventure, medical ethics and euthanasia laws are essential education for future doctors.So I would say Forensic Medicine is more important than you think it is. More over it is one of the easiest subjects in the medical curriculum and makes for some interesting reading apart from regular medical studies. I would say Forensic classes was fun more than a few times and for many reasons.Edit (02/11/2015):I thought I'll add this poem inspired by my first experience of a live autopsy Autopsy RoomAnother grisly death,Another gory tale.Another body arrives,Another yet to come.Silence arrives too.....As a haunting silence can.Death has no humour.Death has no joy.It shows but horror.And potrays all that is vile.Death is dark,Death is black.Death is sad,Death is tragic.Death is sick,Death is ill.Death is quiet,Death is silent.                                    Raghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The golden rule with regard to egoistical doctors is to stay away from such people in as much as it is in your power to do so. I understand that it is not always in our power  since several times in your career as a doctor- as an Intern or a Resident or as a Fellow you are not totally in control of under whom you get to be under. I have suffered under some bosses and I may have some pointers- It may not be all be brilliant advice but that's how I've dealt with it.1. Be good at your job and maintain your integrityWe should do our job the best way it can be done and everybody else play their part. Often times others don’t play their parts but that should never lower our ideals and integrity. Our moral compass should never be affected by the bad things other people do! If you keep your integrity(and whatever you stand for) despite all temptations and rewards to lose it, you have something to be proud of about your life! 2. Never indulge in flattery and sycophancy to get the short term rewardsSome people might even tell you there is no other way to be successful in today’s world other than to feed your boss's ego. That is the worst way to get ahead. If your boss has ego issues, he will never let you get ahead and you forever will be under his shadow. A real mentor believes that people under him can be much better than him and he actually makes it come true.3. Make friendsHelp your colleagues and develop friendships in your workplace- your fellow doctors, the nurse or even the security guard. Be nice to all people and treat them with respect. It is nice to turn up to work and have people actually be happy to see you even if you have a grumpy boss waiting to hammer you. Someone will look out for you in a way they can.4. Remember that ""this too shall pass""Nothing in our life is permanent and things will get better if you have the courage to take the new opportunities that come along. I suffered but eventually I did get better opportunities and wonderful mentors.5. Make peace with the fact that some people are just evilThey just are!!! A lot of egoistical doctors have a ""god complex"" and think whatever they say or do is gospel. If someone disagrees, they then go on to attack them-even personally sometimes. When I see such kind of people on Quora I realize that doctors are not the only people affected by this affliction. You don't have to agree with them. You can just move on and do your job, which is more important than arguing with an idiot!6. Don't ape the Ape!The biggest lesson you need to take from your egoistic senior is not to turn into him when you come to his position. If you repeat the same things your boss did then it turns into a vicious cycle. Try to become a boss that people would want to work with. Observe your egoistic boss and learn not to be like him.Good luck.Thanks for the A2A",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The question asked for a ""photo"" and not ""photos"". I see a lot of the highest upvoted ones are blanket bombing the question with many photos. All of them are good and intriguing none the less.I prefer to answer the question:The most powerful photo I have ever seen is this:The Afghan GirlThis June 1985 cover photo of the National Geographic taken by Steven McCurry in 1984 in the Afghan- Pakistan border. This is the complete photo without the NG logo:This cover photo took the world by storm and the photographer earned critical acclaim for it.

This resulted in a 2002 National Geographic cover:Why my vote goes to the Afghan girl photograph?This photograph enchanted me when I first came across it as a teenager while going through my uncle's NG collection.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"My mother tongue is Tulu but in the same breath my mother tongue is Kannada.  Let me explain.My parents are natives of Dakshina Kannada district. I have been born and brought up in Bangalore till junior college. After travelling all around the country and abroad, I'm back in Bangalore now. Kannada was my second language in school.Why Karnataka is inseparable from Tulu Nadu?It is a erroneous to assume that Tulu, Konkani, Beary are the only languages spoken in that region. Kannada forms an integral part of Dakshina Kannada culture. My father's family hails from Bhramhavara region which includes the Kundapur city which is around 15 kms from Udupi (a predominantly tulu speaking city). The predominant language spoken in Bhramhavara and Kundapur is Kundapura Kannada (also known as Kundagannada). This is a dialect quite distinct from the Mangalore or Bangalore Kannada. My mother is Tulu speaking but her mother is from Shirur-Mandarthi region (26kms from Udupi) which again has Kundagannada as the predominant language. At home, my wife who is from Mumbai predominantly speaks Tulu. So in our house we effortlessly switch between Tulu and Kundapura Kannada. The use would be divided about 50-50. My wife tells me that her parents and grandparents (Tuluvas in ancestry) in Mumbai watch Kannada TV serials and movies even now.This song in Kundagannada from the heartland of Tulunadu just exemplifies why Kannada is still such an integral part of Tulu Culture.This is how intricately woven Kannada is to our Tulu culture. Just like this, Kannada is very much part of Konkani and Beary culture too. Just the two districts- Uttara (North) and Dakshina (South) Kannada districts have so many pockets of distinct languages and dialects that it is impossible to divide it linguistically.Being a Tuluva I believe I am as much a Kannadiga as anyone else living in Karnataka calling it their home. The language I speak at home doesn't define my belonging to Karnataka.Kannada and Tulu- Art and LiteratureAs Rakshith S Ponnathpur writes excellently in his answer about Tulu writers and artists contributing immensely to Kannada literature and movies. I won't repeat the points he mentioned. Yakshagana which has it's origins in ancient Tulu Nadu and Kerala is Kannada based when performed outside of Tulu regions. Tulu is a very old language and Malyalam is believed to have originated from the Tulu language. Tulu is so old that it doesn't have it's own script. Ancient Tulu was apparently written in script resembling present day Malyalam. But in modern times Tulu has always been written in Kannada script. Many Kannada writers, playrights, actors, musicians are from the Tulu Nadu region. I read Kuvempu, Gorur Ramaswamy Iyengar, Girish Karnad, U R Anathamurthy while in school and my life is richer due to their writings. This wouldn't be possible if there was a separate Tulu NaduFun Trivia: Arvind Adiga, winner of Booker's Prize in 2008 for his novel The White Tiger is a Mangalorean and writes in Kannada too in local newspapers.Diversity of Kannada  Kannada itself is very diverse in how it is spoken and written across Karnataka. There are 20 recognized dialects in Kannada but the total number is apparently close to 40 if you include some very remote regional dialects. They all sound very different from each other to the point that something casually spoken in North Karnataka can be considered offensive in South Karnataka. Do we then start making silos of dialects inside the Kannada language?https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Why do we divide ourselves with lines that do not exist?India was divided into different states on linguistic lines after independence. This aided in giving identity to the different states and for local people to develop a sense of territorial loyalty. The states were further divided into districts, and then to municipalities. This was done for purposes of administration and to have inclusive growth so that communities without proportional representation in state and central politics get to have their voice in a democracy. But these divisions have limits.If you have too many voices you only have a cacophony of noise and progress of the collective cannot happen. For example some may say East Bangalore has a dominant Telugu population (hypothetical assumption) so they want to be a separate state. How will that help either East Bangalore or Bangalore mainland or it's people? India's greatest strength is the unity in diversity. We all must learn and keep learning to appreciate the sheer beauty of it. If we all started to see India through myopic lenses of religion, language, caste, political affiliations, etc our biggest strength will transform into absolute chaos. I'm concluding by borrowing a line from the Karnataka Tourism advertisement which seems very apt regarding Karnataka:""One state. Many worlds""",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Of course medical students enjoy their lives. Studying does take up a lot of our time outside of classroom lectures and clinical postings but we do find time to do the things that we love. At least I did. :-)We didn't have a lot of money to go around but we did have fun in way I can't do now. We ate street food, traveled in motorbikes and second class non AC trains, saw movies in single theater movie halls (they existed then) and ate terrible  hostel food to save up money for a new pair of football studs or travel.But the most important is find the right set of friends. Do any of these guys in this photo look like they had anything but fun?​​​College and clinical postings in hospitals gave us a lot fun moments, classroom gossip and pranks sometimes at the expense of others.​​​We played football everyday after class and we played football all over the country at various State and national level tournaments in Pondicherry, Mangalore , Delhi etc representing the college team.​​​Mysore, where I did my MBBS is one of the most beautiful cities in India. How lucky can you get?​​​And we friends loved to travel and we did once every 6 months or so between our terms.

These trips were so frequent we never even took our cameras and those were days of VGA camera phones if we were lucky.I spent a fortnight during my rural postings of my internship in a quaint little beautiful village in Coorg.  There was no TV, no mobile signal and no newspaper also.The only people we saw other than the hospital staff were the tribal patients. The nearest town was 20 kms away. It was almost like a mini-vacation in the wilderness among the coffee estates. I have fond memories of Tithimathi postings. :-)​​​Despite all this FUN in medical college, we still managed to graduate​​​And we aren't doing too badly compared to those who didn't! :-)Thanks for the A2A Akhilesh Gupta",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"In one line:To Kill a Mockingbird (TKM) is a highly stimulating book for a high school student.I'll outline my experience with the book to explain why.This book was first introduced to me by my high school english teacher. It was not part of school curriculum but my teacher insisted that we should read it for our own selves. She had 10 copies of the book- all dog eared to eternity as I remember it- and it was offered to those who volunteered to read it. She had other books which other students could take as well. She told us to read a chapter of the book each week and she kept one class a week spare to answer questions about the book.The book had a radically different language (American South English) than what we were used to but after some initial difficulty it was really engaging. I remember it was the first time I had hear the term ""nigger"". I remember I read about Hitler and the Jews in that book. On asking about it, my teacher encouraged me to read The diary of Anne Frank- which I did. To understand the context of the story I wanted to read about American history- the civil war, Abraham Lincoln, racism, slavery, World wars, segregation and Martin Luther King. You have to remember that for a kid in the 90s in India, access to American history was incredibly difficult to obtain. Remember also that internet wasn't as ubiquitous as it is today. Here too my teacher helped me by giving her British Council Library card to get all the books I wanted to read from. My school curriculum was Indian independence movement but I was more intrigued by the story in TKM that I wanted to know what happened there. I scoured the British library for every book on the subject, every weekend. I wasn't disappointed. If a single book can stimulate the mind of a teenager to read so much more than just his school curriculum, I think the book has achieved it's purpose.The climax of TKM was a little tough for me to interpret from the way it was written. But my brilliant teacher explained it so beautifully. She also discussed some other issues in the book Humanity and morality that is inherent in that book.How percievably good men are sometimes racists too?What rape actually means?How prejudice colours judgement?Why it is important to do the right thing even when everyone else doesn't support you and many other lessons. I kind of identified with Jem- a character in the book and saw a lot of corollaries in what was going on in my own life. All this is as good an education as any for a school going kid.I recently re-read the book and saw many flaws in the writing. The writing isn't magical prose, the story telling is staggered and jumps scenes almost on a line to line basis. As a school kid I was oblivious to all of that. But it does tell a story and a brilliant one at that.When I read the famous quote from TKM:Shoot all the blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin to kill a mockingbird.I rembered how my English teacher explained it to us so many years ago.I said a silent thank you to my English teacher for introducing that book into my life.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"They went from clinic to clinic, hospital to hospital and offered free listing to all doctors. They made multiple calls to get  many details on the doctor.Why would any doctor refuse listing? But in my frank opinion, their website has not made much difference. Their search engine places more importance on a doctor's experience as a doctor than his competence in a specific speciality. So it is is not really a good platform of good specialized doctors. Edit1:Even for general practitioners, when you type in family physician in their search box, my computer shows up an ENT specialist as the first result. I'm assuming that is because the doctor/hospital is paying them. How is that helping the patient? How is that ""finding the right doctor"" as they claim themselves to be?Type in Laproscopic surgery and you won't find a single Laproscopic surgeon in their listing.In Ophthalmology, If you are looking for a Retina Specialist, the search option gives you results for general ophthalmologists in your area who have more than 35 years of experience in General Practice and you won't get a single Ophthalmologist in the first page. 35 years back, there would only be  general ophthalmologists and the oldest Retina surgeon today would have less than 20 years of experience.  So you really cannot find the right doctor for your problem from their website.I haven't got a single patient from Practo.com and neither have any of my colleagues. I'm really surprised why there has been so much investment from so many venture capitalists on this business model. I guess doctors data is more valuable than their services.As pointed out by Praveen Chand Ravipalli I'm not really sure how Practo makes their money.Nevertheless neither patients nor doctors are benefiting from the website.""Confirmed doctor appointments"" quoted by their annual reports is misleading. I come from a family of doctors and I have many friends in the medical profession. Most of them quote the same story. The appointments don't turn up and that could be down to poor user interface. The patients would have better luck turning up in a hospital than wade through the pool of unintuitive data not relevant to them. They have a patient management software which I haven't used nor heard anything great about either. Apparently as mentioned by Praveen again, they have sponsored listings (or paid visibility) and that again spoils their position as a website. Trusting a website which takes payments  to show you in good light becomes a problem. The people who have problems with Pharma companies giving favours to doctors should have the same reservations on this too.They aspire to be something like a Google (or Zomato as they would prefer perhaps) in the health field. They apparently do not intend to make any money on user experience. Why invest anything on it right?Edit 2: I just went through the reviews for their app. It turns out I'm not the only one having these issues​​​",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Do you recognize this guy?​Arthur Ashe (1943-1993) - Tennis Champion and Civil Rights Activist - 千山万水This is Arthur Ashe, an American world No 1 tennis player who won 3 grand slams and is considered one of the best players to have ever played for the United States. The above picture was taken after he won the Wimbledon in 1975.He suffered a Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack) in 1979 at the age of 35. He underwent a Heart Bypass Surgery for which blood transfusion was given. This was before AIDS was discovered as a disease. It is believed that he contracted AIDS from the infected blood he was transfused during that surgery. He was diagnosed in the early 80s but he went public only in 1992 about the disease. When he announced it to the world, letters came pouring in from all over the world.One asked him:""Why does God have to select you for such a bad disease?"".To this Arthur Ashe replied: The world over--50,000,000 children start playing tennis, 5,000,000 learn to play tennis, 500,000 learn professional tennis, 50,000 come to the circuit, 5000 reach the grand slam, 50 reach the Wimbledon, 4 to semi finals, 2 to finals. When I was the one holding the cup, I never asked god ""Why me?"".And today in pain, I should not be asking GOD ""why me?"".The Best Quotes of Arthur AsheI'm Agnostic/Atheist but this response to the letter is so touching, heartfelt and true that I always hold this example to myself whenever I ask myself something like ""why me?'No matter how bad a position I am in I always remember that millions of others have it worse. The world does not owe you anything- success or failure. Shit happens at random. Things get better or worse but it's not the world's fault or responsibility. It is surprising that we don't realize how minuscule our control is on our own lives.I would like to conclude with a Kevin Spacey quote. Playing Frank Underwood he says in the TV series House of Cards:We’ve been crippled by Social Security. By Medicare. Medicaid. Welfare. And entitlements. And that is the root of the problem. Entitlements. Let me be clear: You are entitled to nothing!",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"About 70% of the surgeries I perform are under local anaesthesia and the rest require either sedation or a full general anesthesia. So in my field it is very rare that any loose talk is spoken during surgery because we know and most people around the patient know that the patient can hear us. But during my surgery rotations during my Internship there was always jokes going around the operating table. Even then the jokes based on patients were very rare and usually around the weight of the patient. A surgeon operating on the abdomen has trouble operating on obese people as fat gets in the way of surgery and it bleeds badly too, so to offset the irritation he or the others in the team do crack jokes on the patient's weight or eating habits. That said you really can't prevent everyone from speaking all sorts of crap like in real life. You cannot control the mouths of 30 odd people in an OT from ever speaking a wrong word.My mentor had a brilliant way to prevent loose comments by other doctors, nurses and other OT staff. He used to ask the patient about his/her choice of music and play that on You Tube during surgery and keep asking questions on their choice of music and whether they like the song that is playing. He sometimes asks inane questions to keep the patient occupied. This makes everyone in the OT remember that the patient can hear anything they say. I have inculcated this into my practice as well. I think it works well.What happened with Dr. Tiffany was part stupidity from the doctors and part bad luck that it got recorded. I doubt the patient who recorded the conversation had any noble intentions with it. I had one patient about 2 years back whose husband was recording the conversation that I was having with her. I saw it and told him politely that I don't appreciate it. He feigned innocence and said he was recording so that they don't miss any instructions I may give. I later found out that this guy was a lawyer and his only purpose from recording was to nail me if something goes wrong. I don't think it's cool and it places pressure on the doctor-patient relationship. If you treat a consultation/surgery as a way to corner the doctor to your advantage you'll often end up getting the wrong treatment with the right words! This actually happens more often than you think...Thanks for the A2A Quora User",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I pursued my residency in Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Kolkata. I lived in Kolkata and travelled regularly to different places around West Bengal for about 3 years. I learnt their language, watched their movies, listened to their music, even went to see their plays and interacted with many Bengalis in Bengali. I did all the above on a regular basis, so I think I have a fair idea about who they are. I often identify myself as a half-Bengali. Culture and LanguageThe educated culturally rich folk - the quintessential 'badralok' have very refined taste in food, literature and movies. These aren't seen in the rest of India as much. What is unmistakable is their immense love for their language and culture. That is seen in every expression of it- Music, literature, poems, movies, art, sculptures and even their politics. Everything stems from that and Kolkata is the epicentre of Bengali culture.The incredible talentAnother thing I think is quite exclusive to Bengalis is that every Bengali has one special talent apart from what they do for a living. Some do take advantage of it by cashing in on that, many don't. Many Bengalis are singers, artists, musicians, poets, dancers, cooks, sculptors and other forms of talent. This hobby or talent that we see in adults has actually been encouraged since their childhood by their parents. This is where they differ culturally from the rest of India where school scores and cricket prowess has more value than cultural achievements. You just have to visit Kolkata during durga puja to appreciate the true talent of Bengalis.​​​​The emotional dripBengalis are highly emotional beings and their life is centred around their family. Many households especially in Kolkata often have just one kid for the whole family to dote over. One kid per family is somewhat of a trend there. They often obscess incessantly over their kids, their education and their accomplishments. They are the equivalents of the Tiger Moms of China but in this case both parents are sort of tiger moms. All this emotional turmoil gets transferred generation after generation- again a cultural thing. This also makes them emotionally labile as well as romantic disproportionate to actual situations. Not their best trait according to me.The tourist attractions and weekend getawaysKolkata is full of things to see- the Victoria memorial, the Belur Math and if you like the sea, the nearest beach is only 4 hours out of Kolkata- Digha & Mandormani.​​​​And one of my favourite places in Kolkata is Princep's Ghat​​​​The free thinkers and yet the misersBengali culture is not obscessed about money and hoarding of wealth. For them personal relationships and their culture is more important. This kind of environment gives rise to the kind of stereotypes they form with people of other cultures. This also makes them very careful about money matters. You don't see them flaunt their wealth like in a lot of other cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore etc. The middle class too often come across as a miserly lot and you see them haggle for the smallest stuff in the market.FoodOnly two Bengalis can speak with each other for more than an hour on the topic of edible fish and sweets. Another of their pet peeves. Every conversation begins and ends in food. Even I developed an aquired taste for their famed  but difficult to consume Illish (full of small little bones) and their soft little rosagullas. I do miss the rolls and chelo kababs of Park Street, cakes of Flurrys, chowmein of Dalhousie, momos of Rabindra Sadan, Jhalmuri and chop from College street, Sherbat from Paramount- Mostly small streetside shops and extremely affordable. One thing I absolutely don't miss is passive smoking in coffee house. (I think Kolkata should qualify as the smoking capital of India) Some great people, some not so great ones.During my time in Kolkata, I met some of the best and sweetest people in the world. I found some great teachers, mentors and close friends who I shall cherish all my life. I have been personally rich from my experience of living with Bengalis. At the same time there are some others who I would positively call mad and crazy. The only reason they are not on medication or an asylum is because they are Bengalis in Bengal. Their society is extremely tolerant towards eccentricity and craziness.Amazing urban public transportIn Kolkata you are more safe travelling in one of the multiple modes of public transport- trams, Metro, buses, yellow cabs- than to travel in your own car/two wheeler. It is very economical too. The metro fare has not changed since 1998. And for 5-8 bucks you can travel great distances and in one piece. A tram ride can cost you less than two rupees though you'll reach your destination two days later.​​​​​Bad business and ugly politicsThe typical Bengali is extremely difficult to do business with as he mixes personal life with his professional life. They are inseparable for him. No logic can convince them of industrialization being the mantra for development. Debate gets narrowed down to farmers and capitalists capturing farmers lands. How else can one explain Mamata Banerjee (Trinamool) becoming CM who turned out to be more communist than the communist party who where ruling for 37years previously? She has throttled every kind of industry from setting foot in Bengal. Each and every government entity is drowned in red tape and political control. Even student elections are highly polarized by political parties. Every Bengali has some political affiliation and one would be best advised to avoid politics in conversations with Bengalis or you could land in trouble.In summaryI have fond memories of Kolkata and still cherish the time I spent there. Of course I don't want to generalize all Bengalis into one specific entity but some of it would ring true to many Bengalis too.NB: All images in this answer are from my personal collection.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"You can. There is no official barrier to that. I hope you know already that at the end of medical school in US they are already MDs. I'm assuming you mean Residency.Like Dr. Mitul says FMGs are assessed via USMLE scores and each application for residency is scrutinised for individual merit. The ball is in your court to show that you are valuable to them. Residency is more of a job rather than a degree.So you need 1. Exceptional USMLE scores2. Valuable  and substantial research experience3. Excellent letters of recommendations from people who matter. You should have collaborated with these people for that letter to have any value. 4. All the above and also match up to the competition that is already there. The top residency slots are highly competitive in US not unlike India.Not to discourage you but all the US top Ivy schools' hospitals are not known to be FMG -friendly regarding residency matches unless you have some legacy or monetary benefit to offer them.Would AIIMS offer a residency slot to an American medical student without due diligence? Your main value to them will be if you can serve in areas where US medical students don't usually apply for residency slots. Not so well known hospitals, less competitive specialties, primary healthcare, sub-urban environment and the works. That's hard to digest for FMGs but I see no wrong in that. Every country watches out for themselves first before offering anything for other countrymen. It is fortunate that US is offering such opportunities and making it worth your while to do it. If you choose to go to another country for career opportunities be prepared to have plan A thru Z and to make the compromises when required.Again nothing to discourage you.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"It is important to distinguish between under eye dark circles and under eye bags. It can often be confused. To be sure under eye dark circles are relatively increased pigmentation compared to surrounding facial skin.Causes can be varied including stress, lack of adequate sleep, ageing, genetics, sun damage, pollution, dehydration, allergies, anaemia, vitamin deficiency. It is also important to remember that eyelid skin is the thinnest skin in the body and hence there increased chances of capillary breakdown causing increased pigmentation.There are various ways to tackle such dark circles and it is important to first diagnose the cause of the dark circles. Once the cause is determined (which is usually multi-factorial) then the appropriate treatment can be initiated.The television ads are filled with treatments for dark circles with loads of creams and bleaching agents. The benefits of such treatments is minimal at best. The only usefulness if any of such creams is in moisturizing the skin. Also Ayurvedic and Homeopathic practitioners promise a lot of things (even the moon) but in my experience it almost never works.If one is embarrassed about their dark circles the cheapest way to tackle it is make lifestyle modifications, reduce stress, sleep well, eat healthy and have regular exercise. This may not completely take it away. That's where good make up comes in handy.  Hiding blemishes with make up is an art and some women (and men) are truly talented at this.Medical and non-invasive treatments include Chemical peels, laser resurfacing, Radiofrequency ablation etc.Some topical drugs also offer some improvement but long lasting medical cures are not realistic.Surgery like blepharoplasty can take care of eye bags but may not take care of dark circles completely sometimes especially if they are very pigmented.Surgery for under eye circles are minimally invasive like fat transfer/repositioning, Platelet rich protein injections, Fat or filler injections, etcIf you need advice regarding your particular case I would suggest that you consult a cosmetologist or aesthetic surgeon.Thanks for A2A Quora User",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"What makes a surgeon truly great?I often hear descriptions of famous surgeons as “great”, “amazing”, “brilliant”, etc. and wonder how those adjectives get decided. The corollary used in describing a surgeon is somewhat akin to a performing artist or an athlete. The problem with such an approach is unlike an athlete who can be assessed by statistics or artists who is assessed by cultural expertise of common people, a surgeon does not lend himself to such assessment. A surgeon does not have a publicly available success rate statistic nor do common people have any expert knowledge of surgical procedures to know if a surgeon is great or not. Is surgery so hard? Yes and No. YES because one needs to put in years and years of study to even have the opportunity to hold a scalpel and from then on has to practice relentlessly for many more years to actually master the surgeries in his/her specialty. For that relentless pursuit the surgeons usually have to sacrifice the prime years of their lives to this task, having no time of their own, decreased social and personal life and often living under debt or their parents’ financial benevolence for a little less than half their lives.  NO because its not magic. Most surgical procedures have certain established techniques which if practiced over many years become second nature to the surgeon. So if you know the rules you are set. Of course it goes without saying that you would need a certain level of aptitude and intelligence to learn the complex machinations of the human body, decent memorization ability and a whole load of patience but essentially surgeons are human beings like the rest of us. Only that we surgeons are the lucky ones among humanity who get to wield the scalpel to help humanity as a reward for all those years of hard work.Skill can vary of course like in any profession, they can be excellent, good, average, poor and miserable. Skill, we surgeons are often told is what separates the great from the rest and yet there are many average skilled surgeons doing incredible service to mankind which many highly skilled surgeons could not.So does mere skill of a surgeon decide his greatness? Here its a big no. From what I see from the inside of a surgeon’s world, having started my surgical career 6 yrs back, the greatness of a surgeon has to be measured beyond just skill. Like my Professor in college used to say, “ Anybody can operate,even that cobbler on the street or that OT technician, maybe even skillfully but what should separate you from those people is that you should be able to judge what surgery the patient needs or if he needs surgery at all?” (he had more colourful words to say, this is the watered down version of it, LOL). I recently heard an amazing perspective from a very famous surgeon (he’s a brilliant surgeon by the way): “The reason older experienced surgeons do lesser types of  surgical procedures than younger newer surgeons is not because they are any less fearless or capable than the younger ones its because they are tempered with the wisdom of what works and how well. The ability to cut down on trying too many things and to bring more efficiency and longevity to surgery is what experience brings”  These are two different perspectives with a converging opinion on the importance of clinical judgement of a surgeon being paramount!Doing too much or doing too little? Where do surgeons draw the line? For that the “art of judgement” is the crucial quality of a surgeon. I sometimes feel we as surgeons are often guilty of “surgical over-aggressiveness.” There are times when doctors operate when in hindsight just waiting would have done the trick. Sometimes when a medical treatment would be far more beneficial than a surgical one. Other instances when after surgery the patient is worse off than before. It’s not to say these doctors have any vested interests to operate. They mostly always want to help the patient and often in their zeal probably do too much. Sometimes its more harder for the doctor than the patient to accept that nothing more can be done. But again in trying to solve the “doing too much” problem, surgeons should not fall into the “doing too less” trap which so often happens in many hospitals these days where patients aren't demanding or in the know. There are several instances when doctors just chooses to delay instead of taking that acceptable risk to operate since they don't want to be responsible for somebody’s poor surgical outcome. Some don't even refer to a specialist who is capable of doing the surgery with lesser risk. In the end such a patient’s surgery is not done at the correct time resulting in handicap or he/she succumbs to the disease. This attitude is worse than the “doing too much” phenomenon. As an example i distinctly remember one little girl of 5yrs who came with multiple metastatic cancer to my hospital when the original small eye tumour which was detected a year earlier was not operated by the doctor assuming it to be benign. A clear case of doing too less and the experience is so heartbreaking for everybody concerned.There are no definite answers to most surgical decisions because medicine is a field where results cannot be predicted with pinpoint accuracy like a mathematical model. But surgeons have to take these calls everyday and no one else can do it for them.The surgeon’s judgement sometimes lies between life and death of a patient so its not as simple as people believe it is. I am happy to say with full confidence though that for the most part more good than bad gets done in the full balance of things. The ability to do as much as possible to help the patient yet never letting one go overboard is a balance every surgeon should aspire to attain and this balanced judgement is what makes a surgeon truly GREAT.“From inability to let well alone; from too much zeal for the new and contempt for what is old; from putting knowledge before wisdom, science before art and cleverness before common sense; from treating patients as cases; and from making the cure of the disease more grievous than the endurance of the same, Good Lord, deliver us.”Sir Robert Hutchison, 20th century physician, British Medical Journal, 1953From my blog:The Dream-monger http://raghurajhegde.blogspot.com/",high,high,high,low,low

Tough up for the battle, the actual battles starts after you graduate from medical school.If it is any solace I still feel sometimes that I know nothing and that is why Medicine is an art not rather than pure science.Thanks for the A2A Akhilesh Gupta",high,high,high,low,low

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"With this answer I am probably getting into controversial territory. But I'll take the bait. I think Yakub Memon along with the 10 others who planted the bombs deserved death penalty. There is still a place for death penalty in our country as the ultimate form of punishment. I don't argue with the belief that death penalty does not act as a deterent for the others. My argument is that we don't need such individuals in our society. There is no way these people will in any way assimilate into our society in the future. The Tax payers have to fund keeping these dastardly people alive.As a doctor, it is a tad tough to support capital punishment since doctors are supposed to uphold saving lives and not ending it. But today I am unambiguously clear that we need capital punishment in our laws to govern our country.This decision was helped in no small measure when I accompanied my boss- during my residency in Kolkata- to Alipore Central jail- to examine Aftab Ansari since he was complaining of decreased vision. For those who don't know who he is, he was sentenced to death for https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/... I won't reveal what the problem was as it is bound by patient confidentiality. At that time I couldn't help wonder how much money was being spent to keep him alive. His medical issues were borne by the state. One prison official said security of this one person alone costs about Rs. 10,000/ day. Whenever they have to transport him outside the cost increases to about Rs. 50,000. All these expenditures are coming out of the hard earned money of the tax payers and it is being funded to keep this unremorseful killer alive.Yakub Memon was guilty as charged. The very fact that it has taken 22yrs to execute him and that the final judgement was confirmed by a bench of supreme court judges shows that all due course was followed in this case. The death penalty is given only in the rarest of rare cases and the Mumbai Bomb blasts perpetrators qualify for it without a doubt. Death sentences have very rarely been executed. Only 4 convicts have been executed since the year 2000. There is this section of our country which is trying to paint the picture of Yakub Memon being framed for the crime. They even say he came back to India and surrendered to Indian authorities. These are plain lies when he was in fact caught in Kathmandu trying to flee back to Karachi. A person who was financing this whole plot and in close contact with all those involved, it doesn't take a genius to figure out he was thick into the plot of the Mumbai blasts. I find it really troubling that some Indians want to make him a saint. Bhuvi Jain I'm with you on this point.What I also find disturbing is that there was a 15,000-strong crowd giving this terrorist's dead body a Martyr's farewell in Mumbai no less. I agree that his dead body needed the dignity of a decent burial by his family members. But when you actually have such unrelated crowds paying respects to his body I often wonder how it is possible in India that a terrorist is being openly celebrated. How poorly it reflects on our country. Then we have a political leader recommending Yakub Memon's wife for a Rajya Sabha berth and it starts to make absolutely no sense as to who are we defending here? Indians?Being a terrorist wife is enough reason to become an MP? Appalling to say the least.Then comes the appropriateness of the death penalty as a punishment.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The normal protocol in sperm donation is that the sperm donors are screened twice for HIV including a second test after the window period of 6 months before using for assisted reproduction. During this period of 6 months, the sperm is not released for IVF or artificial insemination.The sperm is collected from donors who are screened thoroughly for infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis B. A blood test is taken prior to acceptance as a donor and is repeated every six months. Since HIV has a window period of 6 months, the sample is not released till the latter test (6 month) is negative for HIV.In sero-discordant couples- where only the husband is HIV positive- who wish to have a biological child with each other, the process known as sperm washing is employed before going ahead with assisted reproduction.Sperm washingThe application of semen washing to reproduction assumes that spermatozoa are not a major reservoir for HIV. The method involves three-steps:filtering the liquefied semen through a density gradient;washing the recovered spermatozoa, to eliminate seminal plasma or non-spermatozoal cells; andrecovering the highly motile spermatozoa by using a swim-up method.These steps can be combined or used separately. In either case, the resulting sperm sample is divided into two parts: one for HIV testing and, if the test proves negative, the other for assisted reproduction techniques, such as intrauterine insemination, conventional in vitro fertilization and intracytoplasmic sperm injection.How good is sperm washing?Efficacy in reducing or eliminating HIV from semen samplesThe range of results of the studies showed that between 0% and 20% of the semen samples tested positive for HIV after semen washing (70 positive cases in a total of 1279 samples). Various semen-washing methods and HIV-detection tests were used. Depending on the method of testing, the lowest limit of detection was 10 copies/ml. Since HIV can, theoretically, remain undetected, semen washing can greatly reduce the risk of infection, but cannot completely exclude it. Real world data : How many people are infected by sperm donation and assisted reproduction from HIV positive individuals?Efficacy and safety in preventing transmission to women and childrenIn 914 serodiscordant couples treated with semen washing, 1680 cycles of ART were performed (72.7% by assisted insemination and the remainder by in vitro fertilization). The studies did not report any HIV infections in the women using ART or in the resulting children.So the answer is ZERO transmission of HIV during assisted reproduction even when he sperm donor was sero-positive.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"A2AWell I'm not sure what perspective the OP wants about a medical student. I can only speak for myself who once was a medical student in India. It is almost 13+ years since I started medical school.It has been quite a ride.I can't really say if it was tougher or easier than other fields but I would say it is quite a tough task for me.StudiesAcademically it was quite hard for me to fit into a medical school. It took me about a year to actually get into the groove. I spent a lot of my first year wondering whether I even belonged there.Till your Plus 2 you have a set syllabus and you know how to plan how to study but in medical college the knowledge is indescribably large and there is no easy way to learn and retain everything. It is also difficult to grasp the new subjects that you have to study now- Anatomy, Physiology and Biochemistry. Anatomy was the hardest for me. After I cleared my first year it was more easier going for me. The biggest change for me was that while I was among the toppers in school medical school was baptism by fire. I struggled to be even in the middle of the class right through my MBBS. I was an average medical student if one were to go by my scores in MBBS. That said I don't want to say that my MBBS was only studies and nothing else. I was involved in a lot of activities during my medical school. SportsI played Football for my college team. I represented my college in Zonals, regionals and National leagues for medicos. We won a few tournaments too. It was not as competitive as other student leagues but was quite competitive at our level. Similarly I was part of the Athletics team- I was into long distance running. Won some medals there too. On top of that we had inter class tournaments in Football, Volleyball, Basketball, Cricket and Athletics.Co-curricular activitiesI was also part of the college quiz team and other teams, attended many college cultural fests winning many prizes while at it.  We had our college cultural fest and college day functions too and spent many days practicing and participating in that.It was pure fun and I wouldn't change anything even if I had the chance.VacationsOur course was divided into terms of 6 months each. After every term we got a few days off before our next term started. Starting with our second year every term my friends and I used to go on vacations. During my MBBS we went to Delhi , Himachal, Goa (twice), Kerala. These vacations are fondly remembered even now despite the last vacation our friend group took was in 2007.Movies and foodEvery Saturday our mess was closed. That was an excuse to escape our horrible mess food and eat outside. Mysore was a really affordable city to eat out. My group of friends were all foodies like me and together we tried every kind of food available in Mysore. A short list is here on my blog: Mysore, the foodie paradiseWe watched every Hindi and English movie released in Mysore every weekend. Guilty as charged :-)Newspapers and BooksBy books I mean non-academic books. I have a reading bug and I compulsively read the newspaper cover to cover and I had to read some book for half an hour before I went to sleep. Well this might not apply to everyone. It was more of a pet peeve than part of our medical curriculum.In summary medical school was a good mix of all the above and the friends I made in medical school were friends I would gladly give an arm and a leg for and I'm sure they would do the same for me. I agree studies occupied a huge amount of our time but we did find time for the things we loved to do. It was filled with many highs and many lows and in the mix of things I don't think I would change much in my life in medical school.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"This was one of the things that intrigued me when I was in high school (late 1990s). I had gone for my first Ophthalmic examination. I had mild Myopia and was made to read from the mirror instead of directly from the eye chart. I asked my Ophthalmologist why this is so and he was kind enough to explain it to me. It boils down to size of the Ophthalmologist's or the optometrist's examination room and some basic high school level mirror optics. The eye chart should ideally be placed at 6 metres from the person's eye to assess the vision accurately. The letters in factory made Snellen's eye chart is a fixed size. Along with other equipments in an eye clinic a 6m (20ft) length of the room is a luxury in most mid level clinics. So to make do with smaller examination rooms the mirror was used creatively to artificially increase the size of the room. The picture below gives a good representation of what I am speaking about.​​Image source: http://lightandmatter.com/html_b...When I joined my Ophthalmology Residency I appreciated this process even more. But I also saw during my residency, these mirror based Snellen's charts being replaced by digital snellens charts in my institution. Digital snellen's chart looks something like that​Image source: http://www.digitaleyechart.com/o...The advantage of the digital snellen's chart is that the size of the letters can be calibrated according to the distance from the patient's chair. So the physical constraints of an office is not a limit anymore. At present as a practicing Ophthalmologist I hardly see the classic mirror based Snellen's eye charts any more. Most modern eye clinics have changed over to the digital version. But both work just as well as the other.To read more about snellen's chart:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm not a huge fan of rote learning and never have been. I understand that medical students have been stereotyped into the biggest muggers of trivial facts. I struggled initially with a lot of memory issues as I was trying to emulate some of my gifted classmates who could mug up whole textbooks and even tell me the page numbers of specific topics. It was a loosing battle and I think somewhere in second year I gave up on it. That's not how it works in the real world. Memory is important for a medical student but after so many years in this profession, I don't find it so much of an issue if your memory is exceptional or not. My memory is maybe above average at best. The premise of your question is based on this image:But this is so not true. Information that does not have any engagement has no value in our lives so we tend to forget things which we do not engage in.Of course to score well in the professional exams, we need to memorize a lot of stuff and go vomit it in the exam next day and then forget about it.You would need to know the Kreb's cycle by heart to pass your biochemistry exam or the brain stem connections all memorized if you want to pass your physiology or Internal medicine exam. But today when I see a patient, to make a diagnosis I only need a working knowledge of the Kreb's cycle and certain specific brain stem lesions and pathways that are associated with Ophthalmology. Because I see such patients day in and day out, the memory of these pathways are imprinted in my brain. I don't need to check textbooks to know if I'm right. But if you ask me suddenly about Kluver Bucy syndrome I wouldn't know what lesion causes it and I don't need to. That's how it works in the real world of medicine. You only need to know the bits you engage in on a day to day basis. I'm too small to know everything and I have made peace with that.I'm certainly not an ideal medical student nor have I got ""distinction"" in any professional exam but what has worked for me over the years is choosing to associate textbook knowledge to real life examples. for example: if there is a Pathology topic I need to learn about, I usually put that lesion in a hypothetical person- I would mentally adjust the age, sex, co-morbidities,etc according to the details mentioned and then such a patient actually walks into my clinic and I'm a surgeon who has to treat. How would I go about it? So this places a direct personal relationship with the pathology topic and things that I read about it suddenly start sticking. I still remember Fat, female, forty and fertile as a typical Gallbladder stone patient though I have not read about gall stones in maybe 7 years!Your dad remembers things from high school because the things taught in high school is basic stuff and the information is bound by the high school syllabus. Medical science is vast and new information is added everyday and no doctor can read everything and retain everything that he/she reads. We need to update ourselves regularly to stimulate our minds. I'm sure in a few years time you will remember enough mathematics from high school to teach your daughter. Maybe not calculus and differentiation but geometry or algebra wouldn't be beyond you.This infographic below and the article from which this has been taken gives a pictorial representation of what I have just written. I wish I knew about this in medical school. Real life problems are fixed with the combination of the learning funnel with the motivational pyramid.The essence of this is that motivation will increase when a learner can create his own (learning) path to the solution. Because the boundaries are given the manager/teacher can let go. The proof of the pudding is in the eating, so does the solution the learner came up with, solves the problem within the given requirements.http://kasperspiro.com/category/...Learn and enjoy what you learn.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I would be more concerned about dropping quality of medical education.It is important that we not compare medical education at present with what it was 40 years ago in India. Medical education today would definitely be better than the what it was in the 1970s. The comparison should be with modern standards of medical education in US/UK and other developed countries. India is severely lagging behind. Other than the institutes of excellence such has AIIMS, JIPMER, CMC- Vellore, some other top tier govt medical colleges and a few private medical colleges, the standards of medical education is appalling. The newer medical colleges in the last 10 years or so- both private and government- have reached new lows in medical education. The problem is two fold1. Government Medical Colleges They start medical colleges in very remote places in India catering to vote banks paying very low salaries to work there from group D worker to Professor. Infrastructure in most of the medical colleges is mediocre. Some don't even have a functioning casualty or ICU or even a pharmacy. Each of  people working in the medical college can make more working outside the hospital than in it or make better living working in a less remote city or town. This decreases the quality of faculty and services in the medical colleges. This again decreases patient load since there is not enough manpower to treat patients. Why would a patient waste a day's labour and time to finally not getting treated. They might as well get treated in a private hospital/doctor or go to the city. When they have poor infrastructure, poor quality faculty and low patient load the quality of medical education suffers2. Private Medical CollegesIt takes a private entity or Individual about Rs. 300-400 crores to set up a new medical college including paying the bribes to central and state ministers, officials in MCI and UGC and other minor players. After they have spent significant capital on establishing the medical college the focus then becomes on recovering capital, increasing profits and reducing running costs. Infrastructure is kept at a bare minimum since MCI inspectors can be easily bought off. Many of the senior faculty are in name only and they actually have fledgling private practices. They only need to turn up to sign every week and collect their paycheck. Of course they need to show their face during the MCI inspection. Most of them do not teach and teaching is left to lower paid lecturers and tutors. They do not want to spend too much on free patient care hence they make no efforts to attract any patients. They even learn that planting patients during inspections is far cheaper. All this while they can sell the MBBS seats for Rs.50 lakhs a piece.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Should medical colleges have management seats?The problems have started to become very apparent already. I know of a medical college next to a remote forest area in Karnataka, India where students pass  their final year without seeing a single patient. The first real patient they see are the ones brought (for a price) from nearby hospitals on the day of the clinical exam. I wonder how the doctors passing out of such factories are going to fare in the real world.So NO.Recklessly increasing the number of medical school slots without proportionate improvement in infrastructure, faculty and patient care is not the right way to go about it. This is a lazy way to increase the number of doctors passing out. It also reflects the governments' and public's penchant for 'quick lazy solutions' for complex deep seated problems.High number of medical graduates and low future potentialIndia already produces around 56,000 new MBBS graduates every year and there are only 14,000 residency slots (private and govt included) available at any given year. What happens to the rest? They get back to the competition pool, increasing the competition every year.On any given year about 1,50,000 MBBS graduates are attempting the various entrance exams for the 14,000 slots (only 5,000 of these are Govt slots, rest are private)Those who want to get into primary care are dissuaded by very low salaries and poor career trajectory in the future. When new doctors do not get into residencies, at that point of time have a few options:1. Study for PG entrance for a few more years with or without working simultaneouslyRaghuraj S. Hegde's answer to How do doctors in India go for post graduation? Do they sit at home and prepare or do they prepare along with working?2. Accept low pay/no pay and work in government run primary health centers.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Medicine and Healthcare: Why do Indian doctors refuse to work in villages?3. Accept a little higher pay and work in private hospitals as duty doctors for the rest of their lives.4. Start a private practice which is getting more difficult in tier 1, 2, 3 cities.5. Pay exorbitant amount of money (Rs. 1-3 crores) to get into a residency which they will never be able to recover in their lifetime.6. Quit a medical career and go for an alternate career options in medical transcription, marketing, administration or research assistants, management, etcSo you can see why it is such a complex problem.Some solutions:There can be many creative ways to get over this problem but I have a few suggestions1. Increase healthcare funding (present 0.8% to 5% of GDP)2. Improve infrastructure, faculty, facilities of existing medical colleges before setting up new toothless medical colleges or increasing residency slots.3. MCI needs to be made corruption free and any kind of corruption among the officials should invite a life ban and heavy fines. This punishment process should be completed within a specific period of 3 months and should be permanent. Not like the present system where the corrupt return to assume office of the MCI once the heat has blown over.4. Medical colleges found providing low standard medical education should be banned from applying for recognition from MCI ever again.5. Improve salaries for people choosing to teach. There needs to an incentive for the present generation of doctors to teach the next generation. Just lip service and poor regard for existing teachers will not improve anything. I'm afraid the next generation of doctors will be deprived of the wisdom of the masters.6. Give improved career opportunities for people graduating MBBS so that they can get into primary care in a more rewarding way than as a compromise presently.7. Increase residency slots in a phased manner only after increasing infrastructure. The good thing about India is there there is no dearth  of patients needing free or subsidized healthcare.I foresee no shortage of clinical experience for any doctors in the near future, only the government has to pull up their socks and make a real contribution in terms of policy.Thanks for the A2A Devarsh Ruparelia",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I don't know what you mean by ""natural"" but you cannot change your refractive error without surgery.I have already written about it several times. Read the answer below.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to How can I reduce the power of the prescription for my eyes?Edit: Here is a comment by a Quora user to this answer.​​​​Here is my answer to that comment. I think people should be smart enough to figure it out themselves:Reply to the above comment:First of all Eye surgeries encompass a whole gamut of surgeries I'm not sure what surgeries you are talking about and how you arrived at the figure of 50%. Ophthalmology has different subspecialties and has many many surgeries.Assuming you are speaking about refractive error I shall attempt to answer. But before I do that I have to let you know that what I say is backed by years of unbiased scientific research.1. Long term results of LASIK are very good and there are very few cases of return of refractive power or Post-Lasik ectasia. The return of refractive power you may be talking about is due to a phenomenon called ""Regression"". Explanation of Regression is beyond the scope of this answer. In short the cornea has an inherent tendency to come back to its original shape. Also 50% is way too much. the realistic figure is less than 1-2%.Here is one long term study on LASIK. There are hundreds more if you search pubmed.​​​2. I can't explain why some guy was able to ""self- correct"" his refractive error without me examining the patient and knowing the details. Also it is impossible for me to know if he ever had refractive error in the first place. If it has such dramatic results you should design a study and publish the results in a reputed journal. Today we only believe in evidence based Medicine.3. There are many eye surgery studies especially in the field of Refractive surgery. You only have to know where to look at.Also as a word of caution. I do not promote widespread refractive surgery. Every surgery has risks. Refractive surgery is a type of cosmetic surgery. There is no shame in having refractive error or wearing glasses.http://www.quora.com/Can-negative-power-eyesight-with-cylindrical-power-be-cured-back-to-normal-by-natural-ways/answer/Raghuraj-S-Hegde/comment/10106889?srid=zkj8&share=1",high,high,high,low,low

Imperfection is an unfortunate word to describe a human body since I don't know the definition of the perfect human. Would removing under eye circles make you live longer? Well I'm digressing. That is a debate for a later date.Let's get to the core of your problem- Under eye circles. Let us suppose it is a major problem for you. You are a movie star/celebrity and your livelihood  depends on conforming to standards of beauty set by the glamour industry. The biggest quandary that your aesthetic surgeon will face is that he is managing a problem in a human body which is dynamic, living thing. He is bound by it and will have to work within those limits. Just because you do not like something in your body it is not necessary to have a solution to it. Just because you have a certain disease there need not be a cure for it just because we live in the space age. There are literally thousands of conditions and diseases that we still don't have good answers too. We are still trying to understand the human body and it will go on till humankind exists. We keep having question and we keep seeking answers.Under-eye circles, though a lucrative incentive for the pharma and beauty industry is not the most pressing medical problems facing our medical researchers or doctors today to solve. Aesthetic surgeons have a lot more tools today than what we had maybe even 10 years ago. We can now get some fantastic results from treatments, procedures and surgeries which were not possible before. What I want to highlight here is that it is an ongoing process and aesthetic surgeons and cosmetologists will get better results as time goes on. Wait for it or seek treatment for it from the correct experts (not snake-oil peddlers) But remember that the things cannot be ""perfect.""However if you seek to know more about under eye circles and treatments available for it this might be a useful resource:Raghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Nature encourages genetic diversity in all living forms because it gives it the best chance of survival. It even occurs with plants. The only purpose of pollination is that genetic material is distributed far and wide from the original plant. Over time this ensures getting positive traits passing on and the negative traits get suppressed. This is the same principle at play when it comes to humans. Humans who are beneficiaries of a wide range of genetic diversity live longer and healthier lives. Many genetic related diseases run in families because of customs, religion and socio-economic circumstances force them to intermarry among family members. Any relative at one degree of separation is strict no-no in the genetic game. Some of the deadliest diseases including some cancers (eg: Retinoblastoma) and blood disorders  (eg: Thalassemia) are a result of consanguinous marriages. These diseases are more prevalent understandably in regions/cultures where such marriages and relationships are common such as most of Asia, Africa and the Middle East. These are less prevalent in western populations/cultures where such relationships are socially frowned upon.

Some among them got into a PG course in Service Quota.Some spent many years (only studying) and still nowhere near getting into PG.Some have got in and out of studying, working in between, trying to get back into studying, trying to plot a scheme into getting into PG, then giving up and finally went off to do research abroad.Some did the same things as the above point and finally ended up taking something they didn't want to do but were forced to since they didn't want to  spend any more time worrying about PG.A lot of people went abroad to US and UK. Few got what they wanted, most of them didn't get what they wanted- some settled for a lesser residency, some moved to other countries to do primary healthcare and some returned back dejected.Some didn't have to study at all. Their parents bought them their PG seats for costs ranging between Rs. 50 Lakhs to 2 Crores (The upper limit has become 4 crore now apparently)Some said ""Screw it. Not my cup of tea"" and joined primary health centers straight out of internship-some among them have got into PG through Service Quota and some are happy continuing in Primary healthcare for a variety of reasons without pursuing PGThe competition is enormous:As of today in India every year, there are (rough figures)4000 Govt college Residency slots6,000 Private college Residency slots2,000 Diploma slots (private and govt)and 150,000 Post-MBBS candidates writing PG entrance examinations.I don't want to rant about reservation here, But it is fair to mention that 49.5% of the government PG slots go to OBC/SC/ST. It does play a big role in how early you get a residency slot. For a general candidate the competition is manifold more. At least half of those Private College Residency slots are prohibitively expensive and some of the rest are obviously sold under the garb of entrance exams.So there...there is more variety to us than you would have thought when you asked this question. In the end what matters is what your priorities are. A lot of us like me were lucky to have a family backing us while we were studying without any income. We had a single minded determination to get into PG and we were also lucky to succeed at our first real try.Some others were not so lucky. They had family problems, financial problems, attitude problems, stress problems, girl/boy problems etc. So priorities change due to those reasons.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I've answered my own questions maybe a few times. I've done it for 3 reasonsMaster question: This was done because I was getting many badly worded and personalized A2As which essentially had the same answer. So I asked a master question and answered it in detail. So whenever I get another similar A2A I either redirect to that answer or merge the questions. Something like thisHow can I reduce the power of the prescription for my eyes?I still get 2-3 A2As like this every week.Information PlacementAnother reason could be information placement.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Thanks for the A2A Quora UserIf you've read any of my previous answers on medical school you would find out that I'm a very average medical student. Not the star student of the class who knows every book like the back of my hand. My first year MBBS professional exams were the hardest exam I had taken till then.....It only got worse from there :-)Well there is a difference between studying for an exam and learning something. This is especially true in medical school.The exams in medical school are so designed that you have to know a specific set of information quoted right off textbooks and you get marks for it. The objective of such an exam is to gain maximum marks and not maximum knowledge to the student. It is true that brilliant students do get to be among the toppers but high or low marks in the exam does not really represent the ability of the medical student to be a good doctor. Very low marks in these exams indicate that the student has made no effort to study so that is not a sign of a good medical student. The exams are not perfect but we don't have a better way to get people off to the next level.Medical science is vast and it does not really have a bound syllabus.​​​​This mountain of knowledge is insurmountable. Make peace with that So let me break it down for youAim: First to pass exams--> once that is achieved try to excelWhat you need?1. Plan2. High yield studies3. What to do days before the exam.4. During exam period1. PlanNever embark on studying for the exam without a plan with set deadlines for everything. Study, food, other daily ablutions. Everything WILL have a deadline. You may have to improvise on it while you study as some topics may take more time than others and there maybe several unsolicited distractions during your study period. Suppose you have 1 month to go for exams, chalk out your study schedule for the next one month to the hour. Key in at least 6 hours of sleep everyday (don't make the mistake I did) and do not ever compromise on sleep. Plan for 10-12 hours of study/day with an hour of break in a day during lunch and half an hour during dinner. Depending on whether you are a morning person or night person plan accordingly. DO NOT TRY to be something you are not or follow your friend's schedule, Your plan has to be customized only for you.2. High yield studies. When you are studying for an exam never make the mistake of studying every little thing because too many non-engaging trivia does not stick in your head for long. Look at the previous year's questions and read those topics first and foremost. Those are the lowest common denominator for any exam that you will take hereafter. PG entrances included. This does not mean things cannot come out of that but if you read those recurring topics at least you have clearing the exams covered. When you read- highlight, make short points summarizing the topics and make detailed notes on the topics if you can (I was too lazy for it in medical school). Keep a healthy mix of subjects. study at least from 2 subjects everyday. Do not waste your time obsessing over what all your classmates are studying. Identify the good students of your class and have a general overview of how they are going about it. You don't have to ape them but they would  have somewhat of a good idea what are the things to be concentrated on. Also remember this: Medical students lie about how much they study. Learn to see through that and understand that they study about three times more than what they are willing to admit.3. What to do days before the exams?Stop studying anything new 10 days before the exams. Have a selective blindness for any topic that is new and has not appeared in the previous years' papers. Revise from your notes or only the topics you have previously read. the last two days reserve for the first paper of the examination. do not make the mistake of studying for the first paper for 1 week before the exam. It'll be difficult to switch to another subject after the paper is over.4. During ExamsAgain sleep well before every exam. At least 6 hours. Trust me it helps immensely. Don't study anything that you have never read previously, the day before a particular paper. Skim through your textbooks and read only the key words (which you have highlighted previously) to reinforce what you have read. Skimming through your text and notes will take you the whole time before exams. Eat a good meal before your exams. Your brain needs all the glucose to function optimally. Answer every question, even those that you know very little about. Golden rule: DON'T LEAVE ANY QUESTION UNANSWEREDNobody has time to read all your detailed writing and explanation. You have to convey to the person evaluating your paper that you understand the concept and have reasonable knowledge about the topic. Flowcharts and  diagrams for every question saves you valuable time  in an exam  paper. Tell your answers in points and not garbled text.Do not spend more than 20 mins for an essay question & 10 mins for a short note. It doesn't have to be your top handwriting but write legibly so that they can read what you have written. Once you have finished one paper, do not discuss it with your classmates as that will not increase your marks.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I once got upgraded to Business class!Wait! That's not what is interesting about it. People get upgraded all the time. It is the how?I was travelling from New Delhi to Singapore after a conference.I had a Malaysian Airlines ticket from Delhi to Singapore with a layover in Kuala Lampur​So it was going to be a 10 hr boring flight.I reached early and stood in the queue at the Malaysian airlines counter.The steward manning the line asked me:""Sir, are you travelling alone?""I said "" Yes""""Would you like a direct flight?""I said ""Of course, yes"" They immediately rushed me to the Singapore Airlines(SQ) counter and the boarding pass was made for me. The flight was already boarding and I literally had to run to the boarding counter at full speed to catch the SQ flight. I entered the economy section of the aircraft and presented the pass to the air hostess. She told me ""Sir, you are in the wrong section. You have a business class ticket""I made my way to the business class cabin still in shock and sat down in my seat. In all the hurry to board the plane, I hadn't noticed the Business class boarding pass!The business class in SQ is excellent. Awesome food and great selection of beverages. I was so excited that I hardly got any sleep. I probably slept less than 2 hrs of the 6hr flight to make complete use of this jackpot! I reached Singapore earlier than scheduled - stuffed, sleep deprived and with a mild hangover. ;-) It was indeed a memorable and interesting experience while travelling and incredible luck too. That was the first and last time I ever traveled in business class. This answer was a result of me being reminded of this episode by Xu Beixi's answer to What airlines have the best business class product? when I commented on that answer.Thanks Xu Beixi for suggesting this experience should be an answer. If I knew I was going to write about this experience on Quora I would have taken a few photos. Hell! I should have kept that SQ boarding pass as memorabilia! Alas!",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The question probably means to say how to improve hand-eye coordination and improve surgical prowess. Some surgeons suggest playing video games to help in the hand eye co-ordination and many surgeons swear by their PlayStations and XBoxes. I however am not a huge fan of video games and I rarely play any video games. Well in my experience, there's very little exercises will do to improve one's surgery. Posture exercises like Yoga and Pilates will help prevent backaches. Also exercises to strengthen the back and leg muscles may help since surgeons operate for long hours, sometimes standing for 12 hrs at a stretch. My residency OT sessions involved operating for hours under a microscope. Your movements then cannot be rough that way. Once one starts practicing under the microscope, your hand-eye coordination grows manifold. Some of the sutures in Ophthalmology are thinner than your hair and we have to practice tying those sutures using microscopes and instruments. You can't even hold the suture with your fingers.In reality though, nothing works quite like practice and independence in surgery. A surgeon often finds his niche while doing the same surgeries repeatedly and in high numbers as a first surgeon. Just the act of doing many surgeries many times gives one opportunities to observe several types of anatomy, several variations of pathology, unexpected complications and how one manages it and of course several variations of surgical technique. Your surgical style would be heavily influenced by your mentor's in your initial years. Over time your technique will change to be more in line with your improved surgical outcomes. A good analogy would be that Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar can play the same cricket shot with success but both will play them in their own style.Once he's found his mojo, his movements becomes more decisive, decisions are made faster, and the most important part is he sees complications even before it happens and makes the appropriate adjustments in surgery. The surgery happens at a ""spinal level"".If you've read Malcolm Gladwell's 'Outliers'​​He talks about success being related to 10,000 hours of practice. I feel this is more than appropriate in a surgical field. If one achieve's 10,000 hrs of surgical time just like a pilot achieves 10,000 hrs of flying time, the surgeon becomes an expert in that field of surgery. Counting my own hours, if I put in an average of 16 hrs of personal surgical time per week, for the six years I've been a surgeon, that would put me around 5,000 hours of surgical time. I'm half way there and maybe in 3 years time I'll reach my surgical nirvana!  :-)Thanks for the A2A Aditi Saini and sorry if the answer was a tad philosophical.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I would like to narrate an incident that happened to my father a few years ago.My father is a family physician in Bangalore practicing since the last 34 years. A respectable citizen who has been doing yeoman service to the community.The particular incident- it was 9:30pm and my father was just about to close his clinic. A 70 yr old man (patient) and his son came in an auto. The patient was a known asthmatic and was having a severe asthmatic episode at that point. My father opened his clinic and got him to a bed so he could give him emergency care before shifting to a hospital. His episode was quite severe and even before my father could start any treatment the patient died. The total time since his arrival to the clinic was 3-5mins. After my father declared the death the son requested for the death certificate which my father agreed to issue. In the meantime the son called his family and within 15-20mins there was a mob of about 100people outside the small clinic.If you know how a mob is...the people at the back don't know what's going on at the front. Someone near the front of the mob had an altercation with a shop keeper next to my father's clinic and broke a bottle from that store. The people at the back having no idea what the cause of the death was stormed into the clinic, destroyed everything inside including free vaccines in the refrigerator, expensive instruments, desk and furniture. They roughed up my father and took his mobile, his watch and about Rs. 10,000 cash from the cabinet. Fortunately my father was not badly hurt and he managed to make his way out of the clinic and took an auto to the nearest police station. The police arrived and cleared the clinic and arrested the few hooligans who were still there destroying things and searching for things to steal.This incident clearly shows a few things:1. A doctor does not have to be wrong always when mob violence occurs.2. The community whom he has served for 34 years did not come to help my father in the time of need. Not one person thought of calling the police. (my father's clinic is in a busy street)3. My father's reputation of so many years was destroyed in a few minutes. Who would think well of a doctor whose clinic was in such a mess?4. My father could have easily refused to take in the patient but he chose to help the patient in need. This is how he was paid back.5. There is no protection for doctors in clinics or even big hospitals.My father was still lucky. He wasn't badly hurt and all loss was monetary. But nowadays every few days there is some incident when mobs resort to violence against doctors. For example this happened a few days ago:12/04/2015 Dr Rohit Gupta(A renowned gastro enterologist of Allahabad) was assaulted by the pts relatives.Pt was 80 yrs old, alcoholic cirrhosis with renal failure & cardiac arrest in late night, revived, but died early in morning at 4 AM.He went to see the patient but relatives thrashed Dr Rohit inside the ICU , snatched his mobile, gold chain and damaged the ICU infrastructure. Dr Rohit suffered fracture face and multiple soft injuries. The CCTV captured this incident. The video is below.Allahabad doctor Dr. Rohit Gupta assaulted: This inability of the society to acknowledge altruism of the doctors will be the reason to discourage the next generation of brilliant students from taking up this unforgiving profession. Doctors are no more demigods or authorities in their field. Their medical decisions will be altered by arm twisting untrusting patients, fear of malpractice suits, defensive medicine, target hounding corporate hospitals, a populist government and an inefficient law system.People blame doctors without thinking why anything happens.One blames poor education of patient's relatives and goon culture for this. This incident may find place in a corner of some newspaper for a day.But what happens after that? What is the law of the land doing to prevent these Kangaroo courts from passing judgment on doctors?Who will take care of the damage to life, property and reputation that a doctor has to suffer? When will the media , politicians and the community wake up? Who will highlight this ugly barbaric side of healthcare in India?Who will rescue the doctor? Anyone listening?Edit1: An online petition has been launched asking the Prime Minister to have more stringent laws for violence against doctors.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I answered a similar question sometime backWhy do the medical specialists need to go to medical school first?Why not just specialize to begin with? For example to train a dermatologist, why not have them do several years of dermatology training + residency from the get-go? We would have more doctors and wouldn't need to pay them as much as we do now (less student debt).I'm not merging the question because this question is worded differently and seeks an answer keeping India in the background. But the answer is quite similar.So quoting my own answer hereRaghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Why do the medical specialists need to go to medical school first?Because some things just take time. The assumption you are making is that a dermatologist learns nothing useful in medical school which he/she would use to treat patients. This assumption is wrongWithout basic knowledge about Medicine, specialized knowledge makes no sense. Your assumption is based in the premise that a dermatologist only studies and treats skin diseases. But no Dermatologist can treat your skin disease without basic knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Public Health, General Medicine, Surgery, Paediatrics, Obstretics and Gynaecology (Phew!!!) And getting this basic knowledge is what medical school is for. The amount of basic knowledge is immense and that is the reason for the years one spends in Medical School.Also not everyone starts as wanting to be dermatologist or a neurosurgeon. The medical students study all the basics and decide to pursue specialization in their area of interest and capability. Residency is a Job where you learn as you work in a specialty.  This too takes anywhere between 3-8 years depending on your country and specialization. There is 8-10 years of solid work to be done before one is qualified to prescribe the cream and tablet that cures your skin ulcers. Don't you think you rather have that than what you are suggesting?In addition to the above quoted answer, I would also like to say that the role of specialization is sometimes incongruously exaggerated. In most patient surveys around India and the world 80% of the sickness can be treated at the primary healthcare point or GPs as they are known. It reduces cost of education for the doctor and healthcare spending for the government if more doctors chose primary healthcare as a viable choice rather than a forced on them due to not getting into PG or government sending them to rural areas. This answer addresses why that is a bad idea.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Medicine and Healthcare: Why do Indian doctors refuse to work in villages?These days everyone wants to be treated by the specialist. To a lay person it might seem like the most correct thing to do and may feel that a super specialist is very accomplished hence also the most capable to treat his disease. The consequences of making the cardiologist treat a common cold is that the patient is wasting a cardiologist’s expertise and overpaying his consultation as well. People don’t realize the importance of a general practitioner or general physician in their healthcare. This discourages newly minted medical professionals from taking up general practice. It is just not viable for them. What is the government doing about this problem. They are completely ignoring the issue and like they have treated primary education, they are treating primary healthcare with the same disdain. They aren’t hiring permanent staff for their rural areas and those hired are paid salaries once in 6 months. They are forcibly making new residents serve in rural areas. This again is a huge waste of valuable resources. Orthopedic surgeons are doubling up as midwives and delivering babies in rural areas since there are no other doctors. How will this change our primary healthcare in anyway? GPs are not average doctors as people would like to think. They have a different set of skills than a super specialist. While a super specialist is restricted to a very narrow field of medicine the GP is trained to look at the patient as a whole.Of course we need specialists. We are falling short in many specializations. But as a super-specialist myself, I feel the impact I can have on healthcare is far less than what my father who is a GP has achieved in 35 years of practice. We need to save our country's GPs or we'll soon have to put them in the same list as the one the tigers are in.Save the Doctor!Thanks for the A2A Saket Daokar",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"""The mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting."" —Plutarch (50-120AD)The only way to learn is to enjoy what you do. Whether it is reading, to cook, a new job, riding a bicycle, a musical instrument or anything new that you want to learn. The process of learning is more than processing visual information from books through the eyes to the brain and stocking it is some corner of your brain. Your mind has to play around what you have read in your head, create new possibilities, scrutinize whether the information provided is accurate and wonder whether it can be done differently.The best way to retain information, however vast is to engage with it in every possible way. You would take that much trouble only if you enjoyed what that engagement does to you. My visual engagement with the stuff I read helps a lot in retaining what I read. Sometimes the things that happen in my head while reading are so enjoyable I'm oblivious to the stupid poker face that I make. My brother calls it the ""reading face"". He jokes around that even if someone stabs me when I'm reading, I wouldn't notice. He's probably right! :-)I'll give you a personal example- During my residency no matter how many books I read about a particular surgery I would never learn anything until I'd practice that surgery on animals, and then on real humans under supervision of my seniors and then later all by myself. Once I had learnt a surgery well, I would then try to come up with a better way to do that surgery. If I succeed- I'll change, if I don't- I'll get back to how it was done by the masters. This is learning according to me. The engagement with what one learns is an education that is difficult to explain to the world obscessed with IQs , child prodigies, tutorials, school scores, rankings and entrance examinations.I'm no expert at learning and I have had my own days at cramming for exams in medical school. I tend to separate learning apart from exams and its scores. Learning- I am selfish enough to do it only for myself. Studying for exams is for others find reason to send me to the next level.If you think of it this way it changes everything. It's shows the flaws of our school system and how we wrongly attribute learning with exam scores. How parents pressurize young kids into getting scores but are not bothered about what they learn..... Ah there are several of those...maybe a grouse for another dayIn summary I'll get back to what I said when I started writing this answer-It ain't learning if its no fun!",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The first time I saw Abdul Kalam in person was when he inaugurated the free school built by JSS Mahavidyapeeth- A Hindu religious institution which owns my Alma Mater- JSS Medical College, Mysore- in 2002.That in itself speak volumes of the kind of unsurpassed respect he commands across all of India without any barriers of politics, religion or politics of religion.Before this visit I had only heard and read about the ""Missile man of India"" from the TV and newspapers. I was was in 1st year of my medical school. We were all supposed to attend the the inauguration but all of us went there happily to hear the great man talk. He spoke to all present there- school children to college professors- in his usual child like demeanor. He asked about 10-12 school children to ask him some question. He was very impressed by some deep questions. One child asked him ""What is the most dangerous weapon in the world"" He thought about it for a few seconds and replied,""Ignorance""I remember this like yesterday even though it happened nearly 13 years ago. He absolutely nailed it with just one word. This is the kind of impact he has on our consciousness.  An unapologetic dreamer, inspiring grandfatheresque figure and an optimist who breathed positivism with every word that he spoke.Why was he so universally loved and celebrated? He removed all the useless fluff from the presidential office. He made the President more approachable. He actually lived the life of the first citizen in it's true essence. At the same time he elevated the office of the President from the ceremonial rubber stamp it was perceived to be before he took over. He gave the office purpose and a stand. In a country bereft of visionary leaders he truly proved to be a leader. Among all the chaff we had a gem. From leading our missile program to leading our country's aspirations he was all in it with his whole self. In his book India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium he shows us that he was always a man thinking of how we can change rather than complain that we haven't. He put his point across with such an innocent charm that we were taken by him. A scientist- Statesman- Patriot that India badly needed at the time.""A developed India by 2020, or even earlier, is not a dream. It need not be a mere vision in the minds of many Indians. It is a mission we can all take up - and succeed."" -APJ Abdul KalamI've read his other books Ignited minds and his autobiography- Wings of fire. Very simple in the prose that it almost seems like a high school kid has written the books. But the ideas in the books were so powerful that it can shake the whole nation. He writes about his early struggles as a scientist in ADE, DRDO and finally in ISRO. How he overcame failures to finally make India a nuclear power to reckon with. “Thinking is the capital, Enterprise is the way, Hard Work is the solution” ― A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power Within India“Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself. They come through you but not from you. You may give them your love but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts.” ― A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Wings of FireHe taught us to dream despite our limited resources and assured us that only our dreams can take us forward and make us do more than we are now. I wrote a poem after reading his book- Wings of fire about dreams.I do not want to list out his scientific contributions which are so well known already but would like to mention that he had a significant role to play to get the India-US nuclear deal pass the parliamentary test. Like a true patriot he managed to convince a populist leader like Mulayam Singh Yadav to support the deal, which finally went through.He supported something very close to my heart: education. A boy, distributing newspapers in Rameshwaram eventually reaching the highest office in the country was only possible due to education and he understood that all too well. His love and dedication for children was fueled in no small measure by this basic understanding of his.""Black' Colour is Sentimentaly Bad"". But ""Every Black Board Makes The Students life Bright - A.P.J. Abdul KalamA lot of people become heroes after they die but here we had one while still alive and yet we couldn't have enough of him.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,No. However your relative can get a restraining order for you to be as far as possible when his/her operation is going on.You have to keep in mind that the operating theater belongs to the hospital and not the patient. The Doctors/nurses are in charge of the people who should be around the operating table. They have the final say as to who should/shouldn't be in the OT.It is important for everybody concerned that the least number of people be near the operating table as possible. People who are of no use to the operation being done are just a burden and inconvenience to the people actually working. OT environment is a high stress environment. One should do as much as possible to reduce the stress levels.Patients' relatives in OT are not a good idea for the following reasons They are not aware of OT protocol and how one has to behave in the OT and the things that they are not supposed to be touching.People who are not medically trained would not even understand what surgery is being done let alone catch something untoward being done.(which I suspect is the reason why the relatives want to come to OT)They would not be allowed to be close to the operating table since they are not scrubbed up. So they can't see much anyway.A lot of people are queasy around blood and gore. Most don't know until they see stuff for the first time. If they faint it is such an inconvenience for the OT personnel and decreases the level of care for the patient.They may also contribute to increased sources of infection.You don't want the surgeon/anesthetists/nurses to be conscious of the relatives' presence rather than the surgery. They can act as barriers to free movement of OT personnel since they do not contribute to the surgery.Thus I see very little reason for a patient's relative to be inside the OT. They might as well let qualified people do their job. The relatives may ask the operating surgeon/ Anesthetists all the questions they want before the surgery (with the patient's permission of course). Holding the patient's hand when they wake up from surgery is a much more important job than standing idle staring at the wall in the OT. The loved one should stick to that.PS: OT is not as dramatic as shown in TV shows like Grey's Anatomy or House or ER. OT is not Universal studios.,high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I think this concept of expecting other people to be honest, altruistic and patriotic is a useless construct. So expecting a politician or a government official to be any of the above is useless too.In fact, corruption starts with common people like you and me. When you vote for politicians who give out dole out policies/laws like Free electricity, water, and free anything. Remember nothing is free.1 rupee/kg rice, wheat and what notMore and more Reservations but less and less good schools to use that reservation.Prevent industrialization by scaring people of capitalists and foreign investments.Create hatred by banning edible things and encouraging people to even kill if it is eaten by other equal citizens of the country.Allow illegal practices during tenure and still get easily elected next election.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I don't know the context to this question. Rahil Ranka asked me to answer this question and reading his answer to the same he has quoted an article on an incident in 2012. Truly sad what happened to the lady in question and pretty shameful response by the hospital concerned.http://www.thealternative.in/soc...Disclaimer: I do not own a hospital or have any business interests in any hospital's running.Before I go on I would like to get this important issue across that most people are not aware ofHealthcare expenditure by our government. India spends only 4% of it's GDP on healthcare out of which only 0.8% is the government's share. With such low levels of investment on the government's part which by the way also includes training doctors, staff salaries and hospital supplies it is a miracle that Indian government hospitals are able to treat patients.Compare that to UK- 7.8% of the total of 9.1% of it's GDP of the healthcare expenditure is government funded. NHS of UK is a model for the world for socialized health care.So you see 80-90% of our healthcare expenditure is in the private sector and through the pocket of the common man. Every year the budget for healthcare gets cut. We have enough money funding junkets for politicians and their stall tactics in Parliament but we have no money to spend on healthcare.Karnataka MLAs' right to Junkets ActStalling Parliament costs us Rs 20,000 a minutePrivate hospitals' motivesPrivate Hospitals are built to make money. If they don't make money, would they build any? With the likes of  Ambanis, Reddys and Singhs owning such huge hospital enterprises (all smart businessmen in their own right), you think they would invest money in endeavors which do not make money? If you think so, you are being naive. Regarding the benefits afforded by the government in lieu of land, tax breaks, rule waivers, etc.. The local politician or official's palms can always be greased to just look the other way. This works out cheaper for the hospital than to treat 10-20% of the patients for free. Unless you can stop corruption, there is no point in making rules like 80-20 bed distribution. Who will guard the guards?The state of our government hospitals and the hypocrisyThe more important question to ask is why our government hospitals are in such bad shape.If you read more about the Reena Kutekar story you will understand what I am speaking aboutRam Kutekar's desperate hunt for a doctor and hospital that would save his wife's life, and his frantic 16-hour journey from Nanavati to Cooper to KEM to JJ Hospital across Mumbai puts the spotlight on everything that is wrong with emergency medical services in the city. And why its poor can never bank on them.• First, Nanavati Hospital refused Reena the operation she so urgently needed because her husband, a daily wage worker, couldn't put together a deposit of Rs 25,000 (He was falling Rs 10,000 short, which he promised to raise as soon as he could).• At Cooper Hospital, the next stop, there was no CT scan facility which meant Reena had to be taken to a private clinic close by leading to precious loss of time. The results showed Reena had suffered serious head injuries and needed urgent surgery.• But Cooper had no neurosurgeons on call at the time, so Ram was asked to take his wife, battling for her life, to KEM Hospital in Parel.• At KEM, there were no beds available in the ICU. Ram was told to head to JJ Hospital.• By the time Reena was put on a ventilator at JJ, it was 11 pm. The neurosurgeon that operated on her told Mumbai Mirror she was in critical condition when she was brought in - “her brain was swollen, her blood pressure had dropped alarmingly”.everywhere : I ran with my dying wife from Nanavati to Cooper to KEM to JJ---One-sided deal: Hospitals get but don’t give back-No lessons learnt, Nanavati hospitalIf you read the above story you see that 3 out of the 4 were public hospitals (Cooper, JJ and KEM), two of which either did not have an ICU or trauma surgeon or in the case of the famed KEM (a premier govt hospital)- ""no beds"". This is the poor state of emergency services in one of our country's most premier government institutes. I have worked in government hospitals myself. There is no consumable supplies, no proper instruments or facilities. All government hospitals get are loads of patients for which doctors can't do anything for.At this point I see a lot of people, even in those news articles about this Reena's incident, blame the doctors. If there are no supplies to sometimes even give first aid  in a governmenyt hospital, how would any doctor be able to do anything?If you want to get the idea of how hard it is to serve as a doctor in a government hospital in India, please read the following article:Doctor’s 35-hr shift on 8 bananas, a toilet in nearby cafe​Up against these kinds of numbers it is a miracle that we are able to even treat the sick in our country. Our healthcare is a total mess. We have politicians and common people clamor for Re. 1 rice, Free electricity, free water, free everything but is anyone bothered about who is going to pay the bill? All these free doles offered by politicians are eating away at things that this money should actually be going for. Why don't we have a single payer insurance based healthcare. Why can't the government pay insurance premiums for medical care of the severely poor people of the country? There are many many issues and I cannot possibly talk about everything in this answer.The moot question is:Why don't we see a single politician clamor for Right to Health Bill?Thanks for the A2A Rahil Ranka",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"If you don't go to clinics, you are losing out on the best experience of medical school: Interaction with patients.Medicine is not learnt from textbooks alone. Most of medicine is more art than pure hard sciences. If you don't learn medicine the way it should be- that is to see real patients with real diseases and how to to diagnose them- I'm afraid you are not going to be a half decent doctor. In fact you are going to struggle to clear your clinical exams.If you are from a medical school worth it's salt they wouldn't allow you to graduate without attending clinics.Medicine is not guitar lessons that you can learn off the internet so if you really want to become a doctor you would attend clinics to learn it for your own self. If you don't want to become a doctor and that's perfectly reasonable too, you should think of another career than medicine. The medical field is ruthless and if you are not driven enough to do it, you've lost it before you have even started.I have the following quote pasted on my desk even to this day:""He who studies medicine without books sails an uncharted sea, but he who studies medicine without patients does not go to sea at all"" - William OslerI always remember that my patients will be my best teachers. I'm humbled and inspired by this fact.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I've had this question pop up in my feed for sometime now. I've finally decided to answer it. I have probably covered this in some of the questions I have answered in the last few months. But here goes:Some of the reasons I can think of. This certainly is not an exhaustive listInfrastructureThe government hospitals in big cities like Bangalore, Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, etc themselves are not the among the best in infrastructure. Even the basic infrastructure already present is poorly maintained. Most days in a month the CT & MRI scanners are not working. This is more like a rule than the exception.  So too the instruments, microscopes, endoscopes, cautery machines and expensive diagnostic equipments suffer from the same fate. If for some reason something stops working, then it wont be fixed till the end of the year or sometimes never at all. This is the story in big cities. So expecting any kind of infrastructure in a rural set up in India is like day dreaming. There are hardly any drugs that are supplied to the Primary Health Centers (PHCs). At the most you would get one huge carton of Paracetamol and a 5 cartons of Diclofenac injections (painkiller) and 10 cartons of Sterile water injections (yes water!) and many more cartons of syringes to inject these. These are highly inadequate to run any kind of village health program. When antibiotics are required, even when the patient can afford (rarely) to buy there is not a medical shop for the next 20-30kms (the nearest town). How would a doctor who has put in so many years getting a medical degree feel in this situation when he can't even treat the people around him. When people do not get better how will they trust him/her? Some people would say why not refer? I worked in some villages 20kms from Mysore during my rural postings during internship. When we want to refer, the patient doesn't even have money to take a bus to the city. We would sometimes have to pay from our own pocket or even take them ourselves to ensure they go. If a patient with a simple throat infection has to be referred to the city for treatment it shows the dismal state of our rural healthcare. Imagine the plight of that helpless doctor in these circumstances.PersonnelThe recruitment for the PHCs is from the state public service commission (PSC). In Karnataka, one of the more prosperous states in India more than 50% of the slots remain vacant. Why do you think? The corrupt officials running the KPSC always recruit less even when enough applicants are present since keeping the demand high is very good business for them. The going rate of bribe in Karnataka for a PHC doctor's job right now is around 1.5-2 lakhs. The job has a listed salary of Rs. 30,000 - 42,000 pm! Many of the applicants are recruited on an ad-hoc basis streching from 6 months to 2 years and then the whole process starts again. Giving permanent jobs reduces the officials' black revenue.Now we have one politician who wants to win the next election. Who can he target? Oh the new medical students graduating out of medical colleges!!! Give some speeches of doctors only making money in cities and not serving the poor, put in some fines, threaten their PG seats and the job is done. If not the media does the rest. After a year of this forced labour where the doctor is given no agenda nor help to set up anything in a village,  he's just kicked out in the open. If that student really wants to serve the villages for a few more years he has to put in all the efforts I mentioned in the previous paragraph. Will any sane man do this? I fail to understand who is benefiting from this futile exercise?Then comes the specialists and superspecialists who are posted in the peripheral community health centers without even basic infrastructure or even a semblance of an OT. You won't get gloves, linen, sterile instruments or even clean bed in these hospitals. My oncologist friend served his 3 year govt bond after his post graduation in a remote village in Tamil Nadu. He spent everyday of those 3 years referring patients to the city, most of whom never reached there. Forget chemotherapy and radiation the medical college he served in did not even have pharmacy to buy drugs. My Orthopaedic (bone) surgeon friend served a year in a community health center doing everything from delivering babies to making house to house visits of every panchayat leader in the villages around. There were no mid-wives even. He hardly fixed a bone the whole year because there was not even material for the cast. He could not even buy it himself because his salary never came and he quit after a year. How is this stupidity helping improve rural health? Is this the best use of the specialist's expertise?AdministrationI have many of my friends working in PHCs. There is a huge hierarchy in the government medical service where too many people in the middle are hardly working. The doctor assigned responsibility of a PHC is not given autonomous control over the running of the same. 50% of his/her time is spent in CYA* in the administration rigmarole set up by their superiors to escape blame for anything wrong that happens. Rest of it is spent in seeing patients, managing lower level staff, putting up with all kinds of nonsense from the villagers, inspecting the whole village for any risks of Dengue, malaria, gastroenteritis etc. and of course getting frustrated at the system. Even the staff under him is not under his control. He cannot even fire the group D staff of the PHC he is supposed to be heading. There is so much administrative burden on this one single man and he's not even trained to do that. He just has to jump into this dirty puddle and learn to swim by himself. All he really wanted to do was help treat people in the rural areas.*CYA- cover your assNo scope of progressThere is no clear career trajectory for a doctor working in a rural area. They may get some reservation in the PG entrance exams but if you continue to do primary health care in the villages you don't go up the ladder at no time during your job. You will keep doing the same job at 60 what you were doing at 25. There is no mentor, forget that- not even someone bothered whether you are progressing. How would you feel to be an intern throughout your life?SecurityForget it. I won't even speak about it. We can't seem to protect the doctors in the cities how will we even think of those poor village doctors?PayI put this in last, lest people would comment how inconsiderate thinking about paying a doctor. I don't have an issue with the salaries posted but I am bothered by how they pay. Let me give you an example to explain. Four friends of mine are serving in PHCs in very remote villages where no doctor wants to go. They are working there because it is closer to their home. They haven't received their salaries since 6 months!!! They have a protest about this for one day and the media vultures eat them up. I know people expect doctors to be so altruistic that they should work for free but which job in the world gets done if you don't pay people for 6 months at a stretch? You demand why this happens and they say this minister has to release the funds and that official has to sign the papers, so it takes time. So how do govt employees like Bus conductors, Bus drivers, bank officials, group D and other govt officials like IAS, IPS, IFS get their salaries on the 25th of every month without this ""inevitable delay"" ? Because if you don't pay these people on time they won't turn up to work next day. Simple as that.I'm sure there will be people disagreeing with everything that I've said above and then go on to complain about the rampant corruption among doctors, commissions they receive and sub-standard care of someone they knew. There are many people in India who are like an ostrich with it's head in the sand and thinking everything is all right. They expect solutions to fall from the sky. If they can blame it on someone else their job is done. But I would like someone to suggest how anyone would be able to improve the situation in rural areas without putting the onus on unpaid, ill-treated and frustrated doctors. Can someone suggest a good enough solution? ""OMG!!! How can they ask that?""",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Though I never let things like colour matter in my life I see the daily subtle reinforcement of ""Fair skin better than dark skin"" belief everyday in society, media, schools,colleges and sadly among many of my relatives. Maybe being a guy helped me in the sense that being a dark skinned girl would have made me a subject of even more ridicule. I wrote this poem many years ago (I was probably 20 at the time). I was bothered about how people around you will judge you based on your colour and not on the person you are.                            Blackie  'Blackie!' calls out a voice so clear.Black is my colour, Black is the day.This colour anoints my colourless life.But why am I still called a black today? I hear governments call for equal rights,I hear men chanting 'Blacks equal Whites',I hear promises of equality well within sights,I hear of times when will be bereft of fights. Life is kinder to the fair skinned,Not so much for the darker onesNature will carry this legacy on,Extend it to my daughters and sons. Times change, people change.But I am still a victim of prejudice.And I cannot ask any better,For they have a white law and a black justice. How long will I stand this tyranny?How long before I decide to fight back?Against man's wrath unto man himself,Against a superiority of white over black. Alas! A prism every society is,Divides colours for it's own need,And proclaims with shameless candour,'Every colour is part of a white indeed!' Whatever I may do,A fault, they will surely find.Wherever I may live,The world is still not colour blind.                                               Raghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"A couple of my female classmates in medical school used to do something quite similar to what you are describing. They spoke in high pitched falsetto voices when speaking to guys in a way small kids talk. Let me elaborate the small kids thing. If you see little kids they speak with their whole body, moving or rocking their body as they speak as a kind of distraction for people who are listening. This is something kids learn very fast to get what they need.The girl classmates spoke in a very similar way to guys especially when they wanted something from them. They spoke in a normal tone/correct body language with other girls. What was surprising was the susceptibility of the guys to this kind of mind manipulation. I think some of the guys enjoyed this kind of behavior from them. It worked every single time with those guys. They ended up doing some pretty foolish things and the girls got their work done at zero cost. Whether it is their assignments or study materials or personal agendas these guys bent over backwards to help them.Just like such kind of girls exist, their prey-the susceptible guys also exist and these kind of girls know exactly who they are. I assume they must have a way to test the susceptible people. Of course there is no age barrier for this phenomenon. If worked pretty well on some male professors too. :-)I've encountered many such girls at various times at various places since my medical school. This kind of behavior in front of me always got a shocked confused look from me and probably discouraging them from trying it again on me.It annoys the hell out of me.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I feel it varies widely and depends on the personal preferences of each person and what works for them.It also depends on the purpose of the reading. For pleasure or for study. I'll speak from personal experience.If it is for pleasure it really doesn't matter. I don't usually need to do more than read silently and everything usually sticks without effort. I sometimes may check up with facts from other sources for my personal interestIf it is for study, I read silently and may make small points as notes. This is something like a personal index which helps me in recollecting things I have studied. They don't make much sense to anyone else but me. I find it highly distracting to read things out loud while studying. If I'm reading silently it gives my brain the opportunity to process information.Some people may differ with my view. Some people feel the double feedback from reading with your eyes and reading out loud helps in retaining information. Of course many times the difference between pleasure or study is blurred. Which is better is personal preference. I prefer reading silently and it helps not to irritate people around me especially in libraries.Writing definitely helps but I don't have time to write out everything I read. Short points do the trick for me. In any case my reading speed is much faster than my writing or typing speed. Its futile in my opinion because I believe knowledge comes from engagement with information and not rote learning.Thanks  for the A2A Ashwini Channagoudar",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"First of all whether a doctor should marry another doctor or not, is dependent on a lot of factors. First factor is love of course and is whether you see your spouse as a long term commitment. Those who say it is the only one is lying. Other factors include your personalities, ambitions, professional goals, spouse's personality, spouse's professional goals and expectations from both sides.I cannot speak for all doctors I'll speak about myself with my story.My marriageI'm married to a Chartered Accountant. We'll be celebrating our 2 year anniversary this December. None of her immediate family members are anywhere connected to the medical field while I come from a family of doctors. To be honest, I'm literally sick of doctors and their medicine related stories. Ha ha. Having a non-medico wife adds awesome sauce to my life.Why ""I think"" doctors end up marrying doctors.People would be surprised that doctor's marriage has little to do with their spouses' profession. Most doctors end up marrying doctors since they spend an excessive amount of time with other doctors during medical school, residency and fellowships. Fertile places for romances to happen. I'm the only one among my close friends' circle to have married a non-doctor. Indian society also places social pressure for doctors to marry doctors. My mom tried a fair bit. :-)My philosophyI don't believe in defining myself only as a doctor. In fact I believe that being a doctor is only one of the things that I can be and have always believed that I will not let my profession define who I am as a human being. Hence when it came to a life partner I kept an open mind and slightly preferring to have a non-doctor wife.The advantages of marrying a non-medical spouse.1.Independent Professional livesThe biggest advantage is we don't get our work home and each of us can live independent professional lives. I'm as oblivious of taxation and audits as she is about medicine and surgery. 2. It expands our life experiences. Being only with doctors all the time restricts our life to personalities in the medical field. Our friend circle are very different from each other and it is surely fun when we interact with each other's friends. My friend circle is a mix but with many doctors while her friend circle has people from other different professions. 3. There is healthy respect for each other's work. We can't really compare both our professions (Auditing and Medicine) as to which is more important. Except maybe money ( she makes more :-)). This spares us the ego clashes that is so prevalent in doctor-doctor marriages.4. Holidays. She has more relaxed work schedule than mine. I work 5-6 days a week and have unpredictable schedules. My wife has a 5 day 9-5 job. She plans our weekend engagements and also travel when we do. I cannot imagine many doctor spouses do that with an 80 hour week.5. FinanceMedicine does not guarantee financial success like many other professions. At least the first 10 years of a doctor's career in India is financially unstable and it can be a struggle go pay the bills sometimes. It makes little sense to have two doctors struggling in a marriage. I'm lucky I'm the only one in mine.Disadvantages with a non medical spouse1.TimeI don't get as much time as I would like to spend with my wife. Maybe I would if I wasn't a doctor. I may not be as busy as some of my other colleagues in more emergency care specialties, but even in my free time I'm not truly free. I have to read the latest research publications in my field to be on top of my game, do bench research, make presentations for conferences that I'm invited to present my research papers, be part of various doctor forums sometimes as moderator, social work in the form of mission trips offering free service. All this apart from seeing patients, performing surgery, teaching residents and commuting to and fro to hospitals. This restricts my time at home but I think we are doing a good job with what we have. We have the occasional differences when she finds it tough to see how those things are important to me. But she always understands in the end and makes peace with it.2. Not-Sharing the stress loadNot knowing about each other's profession can be a good thing and sometimes a bad thing. For example, I cannot readily share the intricate problems in my profession and office without giving detailed background of it to my wife. The detailed background wouldn't be required for an doctor spouse. The detailing is waste of useful time we have together, hence I avoid all of it. So many of the work related stress cannot be shared but I feel it is a good thing at least in my case. I don't have many things that bother me much so it is not much of an issue.3. Not understanding the significance of accomplishments/failuresNot being in the medical field, a non-medico spouse wouldn't be able to fully appreciate a doctor partner's accomplishments in Academics, Clinical and surgical feats. This is the same for failures. The full magnitude of the significance may sometimes be missing.In conclusionIrrespective of professions both partners have to discuss their long term professional goals, expectations and the sacrifices they are willing to make. It can't be a zero sum game. The future plans have to be complementary and not contradictory. Modern marriages are a two way street. If your partner is important to you, you would make the compromises without being asked to do so.The following blog post is an excellent view from the other side of the Doctor-non medico marriage.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"This is an interesting question but it doesn't have a very simple answer. It needs some understanding of advanced optics. I'll try to explain it in as simple language as possible.The computerized eye- checking machine is called the Auto-refractometer. It looks something like this:​​​​The actual technology in each machine varies widely but basically all Auto-refractometers have the following three things:An Infrared lightA fixation targetA Badal lensThe schematic diagram demonstrating the basic principle of the auto-refractometer is in the figure below:​​​Infrared light is used in these machines because it has the least scatter potential so it can travel long distances without scattering (for context- your laser pointer). This is ideal in a machine like this (which measures difference in polarization) and I'll explain why later.A fixation target is used to relax the accommodation of the eye (the focusing power of the eye). It uses the fogging method to accomplish this action. It blurs the image of the target before it takes objective measurements.The Badal lens is one which does the measurements. The relative distance between the Badal lens and the eye has a linear relationship with the refractive power of the eye. (See the scale below the lens in the diagram)The ""very""simplified version of the workingThe actual process of measurement involves sending a fine ray of infrared light into the eye to be reflected back from the retina. The light sensor in the machine detects the polarisation of the reflected light and compares it against the incident light. The badal lens now moves to equalize the polarization. The analog movement of the badal lens is captured by the computer and converted to digital reading.Of course modern machines employ much more complex designs and principles to be more accurate and the explanation of that is beyond the scope of this answer.Also one needs to understand that the Auto-refractometer gives an objective measurement of refractive error but Glasses and contact lenses are given after subjective refraction- that is the power that the patient is comfortable with that the optometrist/ophthalmologist checks with lenses. So human involvement is also required to prescribe you glasses. The Automated refraction just speeds up the process.Image sources:1. Page on optometry.co.uk2.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm not really very qualified to answer this question and I may not be able to tell you all details. From the limited knowledge that I have Australia and NZ have limited residency slots so it is usual even for Aus and NZ graduates to work as medical officer equivalent for many years before landing a residency. These are particularly true of residencies of high demand such as Surgery, Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology etc.However that said there are certain areas where they have an acute need for doctors. Low demand residencies like Psychiatry, internal medicine and General practice (I'm not too sure whether GPs are low demand in Australia. I keep hearing that they make more than some specialists there)Also in Australia they have something called areas of need where local doctors do not want to practice but those areas need primary care. So the Australian government has encouraged foreign medical graduates to immigrate to Australia to serve in those areas of need. Many of my seniors and friends from India have taken this route to make a living in Australia.To be eligible to practice in Australia you need to clear their AUS/NZ board exams which I'm guessing you would know quite well. Some of these exams are quite difficult to clear especially in very competitive and surgical fields. (They keep the bar too high).

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"You have to first understand what Colour blindness is.What is colour blindness?Colour Blindness is a x linked recessive gene inherited condition. It is seen in about 5% of the population. It is seen mostly in males and rarely in females. It is maternally inherited and usually seen in the male line of the family.Colour Blindness does not mean actual blindness but impairment of colour vision. The impairment is usually part of a spectrum from high to low. It is very rare that someone would see the world in black and white so as to speak.It was first described by John Dalton, an English chemist and physicist in 1798. He basically discovered his own colour blindness hence it was known as Daltonism for sometime but today it is only referred to one kind of colour blindness- Deuternopia.The basic pathophysiology is that the genes that code for retinal cones that percieve colour are at fault. The types retinal cones usually correspond to the three primary colours Red, Blue and Green. Deficiency of any of these types can give rise to one of three forms of colour blindness-ProtanomalyDeuteranomalyTritanomalyAchromatopsia - extremely rare. (Never seen one in my lifetime)What should you do if you have colour blindness? Nothing much since you are born with it. Usually the colour blindness is partial and restricted to not being able to differentiate between a few colours. This is not going to affect your quality of life unless you let it. You never miss what you never have!There are some glasses/contact lens available which act as filters which block some part of the light so that people can differentiate between colours they previously could not.http://enchroma.com/The effects may not be as dramatic as this person's These glasses can be very expensive and it may not be suitable for some people. You can certainly give it a try if you want to.But even without treatment people who are colour impaired usually over time start to use some other visual cues like contrast sensitivity and luminance to differentiate between colours. Some get quite good at it. The important thing to remember is what looks orange to a colour blind person is a different shade than what is seen by a person without colour impairment. But both call it orange. Some jobs need to be avoided and I have talked about that in this answer. Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to What jobs are available for colour blind people?So my advice to you is this-1. Don't believe tall claims by fake doctors, quacks and websites which claim to mind train you out of colour blindness.2. Don't obscess about your colour blindness. It is no great barrier for success at anything you do. John Dalton who discovered colour blindness was colour blind himself. That didn't stop him from being a world renouned Physicist, meteorologist and Chemist doing ground breaking work in atomic theory and colour blindness.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm an Allopathic doctor and my views may be interpreted as coloured by hate for Ayurveda. Actually it is not.I do not have an issue per se with  marketing of Ayurveda products to the general public as long as it conforms to standards of food safety as other food stuffs in the market. I mean there are so many harmful things we put into our bodies everyday, if some ayurvedic drug (free of toxins) is marketed there will be no issues with it. At best it can act as a placebo for people who believe in them or ""cure them from inside"" as the proponents may claim. Right?The truth is not so simple to digest, literally and figurately. As I have highlighted in my answer to another question on Ayurveda(Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Do you trust Ayurveda products?) These herbal drugs have heavy metals in such high quantities that it would embarrass the Government which is trying to prosecute Nestle over Maggi's Lead content. I also have an issue with advertisements like these​​​​The advertisement is so successful that this (quack)-doctor has not even bothered to correct the spellings of the medical conditions he claims to cure. He even has You Tube videos like these:Apparently this quack has been honoured as ""Jewels of UP"" by the UP government.I have a huge issue with these kind of people cheating the gullible uneducated public into thinking that they can cure cancers like Retinoblastoma with his ""bhasma"" powders.This is plain wrong. He sure has blood on his hands, preventing small kids from getting correct treatment by misguiding the public. (Retinoblastoma has >95% patient survival rate when given appropriate treatment).He has also advertises his eye drop​​​​During my residency many patients came to my institute after years of using these drops to cure themselves of Cataract, Retinal diseases, Glaucoma and others. If they had reached an Ophthalmologist earlier their vision potentially could have been saved. Surprisingly these patients consisted of both Uneducated and poor as well as Rich and educated. The charm of miracle cures affects our population at such a basic level that no amount of education can change their perceptions. Everyone loves to see this.​​​​How wonderful that looks right?Well you might think I'm only talking about this one person's fraud. I am an Ophthalmologist so I focused first on quackery in my speciality.A random search on the net will give you these kind of advertisements.(just to mention a few)​​​​Ayurvedic Angioplasty- Of course proven by God I suppose.​​​​Baba Ramdev's Male-child producing medicine.​​​​Ayurveda promises to control blood sugar with regular intake. What proof you ask? Who needs proof when you can sell your drugs for millions?​​​​Multi-purpose medicine- lose weight and improve joints and probably become Superman. Just ""Guggul"" your disease and it will cure you.The issue I want to highlight is why are ayurvedic drugs which claim to cure so many things not subjected to more scrutiny by the government and authorities. The same institutions which are bothered about harmful toxins in Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Maggi are not the least bothered about regulating these traditional drugs. As long as it is meant for human consumption it should conform to permissible limits of toxic substances. Why are there different rules for these factories which produce herbal traditional remedies and another set of rules for Allopathic medicine producing pharma companies?I often hear of people's distrust in big pharma companies because they profit from thrusting medicine down their throats. But why do people think that Ayurveda companies are not making similar profits by the very same methods.Baba Ramdev (Annual revenues >$1.5 billion), Dabur (Anuual Revenue $1 billion)Himalaya (Annual revenue >$2.3billion) Source: Their Auditors reports which are online.I don't wish to belittle basic science research being done which have found anti-cancer properties of some plants, fruits,seeds and herbs. If these translate into real drugs curing real diseases after rigourous scientific testing, no one would be more happier than me. I do not hate Ayurveda, I only have an issue with how it is being used to con people.Edit 1: It is surprising how all pervading this scam is.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I had written about my day in another question.The questions are a little different so I won't merge it. I also assume you may not be interested in the nitty gritty of what surgeries I do so I'll stick to layman terms.So here goes my account.A surgeon's schedule-at least a younger surgeon's- is never set in stone. Every day is quite unpredictable. Broadly I would say my day depends on whether I have a full clinic session or a surgical session or a mixture of both. Also on some days I have to attend academic sessions.My morning schedule:I get up quite early at around 5:30-6am. Go for a jog. I read the newspaper quite religiously for half an hour, then take a shower and get ready. Depending on the day and when I have to be at work I either take breakfast at home or at work. If I have an academic session I have to be at the hospital by 7:30- 8am depending on the session otherwise I land up in my clinic at 8:30-9:00amHospital Schedule:I'm a consultant at 4 different eye hospitals and one Cancer care Hospital. My level of engagement with different hospitals varies on a day to day basis as each hospital have their own schedules.Academic sessions: Presentations, Tumour boards and Discussions with Colleagues and Residents.Clinic Sessions: where we see patients with fresh complaints/on follow up/ post-operative visits.Surgical sessions: Where we list all the surgeries that we do.My usual working day is a combination of the above three. It varies a lot depending on the combination. I have a working lunch somewhere in between at work (sometimes packed from home). My working day starts at 7:30 am and ends at 6-8 pm depending on the list. Then there are some emergencies I attend to sometimes. I also have to put the obnoxious Bangalore traffic to the mix. (I wish I owned a helicopter)Night Schedule:A perfect night schedule would be the following. (though for reasons I mentioned above it is quite flexible sometimes as unpredictable as my work)Home at 8 pm. Have Dinner. Say a cheerful ""Hi"" to my wife back from work. (not really in that order if you know what I mean!). Read any newspaper I had left out in the morning.(yeah I realize that this is a crazy obsession), Browse/answer emails, browse the net checking random things (yes even I do it,don't judge me), Check Quora and spend about an hour (or two) reading and answering (this is a new found addiction which don't get me brownie points with my wife :-( ), watch an episode of some good TV series (not a regular habit, only sometimes). Read a book for an hour (medical or others)and finally force myself to sleep by 12am.Thanks for the A2A Gowtham Kumar",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm elated. The full impact of the news is still sinking in. The implications of being QOTW should become apparent in the next week or so. My patients today morning got an extra dose of my smile (or thought their doc is crazy!).To put it in a single sentence:It is the best Diwali gift I have ever received.When Mohan messaged me last week that I was selected as QOTW, I had just come back home after an eight hour surgical session. I was quite bummed out and tired. This news instantly changed my mood and I couldn't believe that someone found my answers worthy enough to nominate me. That someone was Koyel. I think we have interacted on Quora in the past few months and our bong connection has resulted in a sort of a Quora kinship (or possibly I'm the evil twin brother, I can't say!). I saw Archie's message next day and then the questions when I was ready to leave for work. I promised to revert to him soon. It was a busy week for me and I composed in my head all my answers to his questions while driving through Bangalore's long horrendous traffic. Once I came back home I wrote everything I had thought about all day and maybe threw too much at him not realizing it wasn't my biography. He somehow condensed my huge thesis into a readable and concise post. In the process he made my boring little life sound like something cool and interesting. Thanks for that Archie.True to form, when the QOTW post went live, I was busy composing an answer on Quora about the etymology of Plastic Surgery. When I read the post, several people had already commented and I was surprised by the love of so many fellow quorans and it felt really good that so many people I respected actually liked my content.The response was overwhelming with lots of congratulatory messages. Till yesterday I hadn't shared my involvement in Quora on Facebook. I decided to share this special post on my FB wall. Many of my friends and family didn't know what Quora was and wondered where I got the time to write so much. In reality, Quora provided me with an opportunity to voice my perspectives in a non-intrusive and yet rewarding way.The response on Quora since, has been something unprecedented. I got a record number of followers in a single day, way too many upvotes, quite a few A2As which has been put to the answer later list- and also the honour of answering this question. :-)When I first started writing on Quora, I hadn't imagined my engagement would result in me being considered a valuable asset on the site. It was only November last year that I started writing here and I only noticed a month back that I had written 500+ answers within a year. I haven't had such a productive year in all my years of writing. I have been blogging since 2008-09 but I haven't attracted traffic towards my writing like how I did on Quora. QOTW is a validation that I belong here. I would certainly be encouraged to continue contributing to this wonderful website which I've grown to love.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"My favourite has been The No. 5 at Emerald Hill. Just for the novelty factor. It is probably one of the oldest bars in Singapore. It is right off Orchard road.What greets you is this perrankan style two storied building which is so old school.​​​​​Image source: http://www.singapore-guide.com/n...It has oak pannelled interiors giving the early 1900s vibe.​​​​​Image source:  http://sg.asia-city.com/nightlif...​​​​Image source: http://www.maksinwee.com/2014/09...Their walls are full of black and white photographs of old movie stars.​​​​Image source: http://yummyyummyyummy.blogspot....Their signature martinis are a hugely popular. Many of their vodka and gin based cocktails too are quite appealing. My favourite drink is their house speciality No. 5 Original Chilli Vodka.The best part of the experience at No. 5 is the roasted groundnuts with shells they provide on the house. You are expected to remove the shells yourself and traditionally throw it right on the floor unlike many places in Singapore where literring is literally a crime.The drinks start at about $15 and you have one on one offer during happy hours. It is open till 2 am.  Here are some photos I pulled up from my personal collection.​​​​​​But if you would rather go to regular modern pubs, lounges and bars your choices are many- Robertson Quay, Clarke Quay and Boat Quay provide many choices. Not a bad night out though.​​Even the famed Altitude One is an excellent one time experince. I took this photograph right atop Altitude one. This is one of my favorite among the photos I took in Singapore.​The drinks though were very expensive and just about average.​If you are a wine connoisseur and in the mood for some great steaks, pork ribs and italian thin crust pizzas, The Wine Connection at Robertson Quay is a good place to hang out. You may sometimes get good rates for a wide variety of wines​​​If you want some beach side ambience the Sentosa Island beach lounges makes for some beautiful background scenery. Some of my personal photos.​​​​However if you are in the mood for some Japanese food and some rice Sake I would definitely recommend The Standing Sushi Bar at Marina Link Mall.​There are many many bars including ones in China Town and Marina area that I've not mentioned but the ones I have mentioned have been the highlights for me.Image disclaimer: The images where I have not mentioned the source below it are from my personal collection.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,I would say getting into medical school is the easy part of becoming a doctor at least in India. True meritocracy is not of much importance in India.Getting into medical school needs one or more of the following1. Money power2. Political influence3. Reservation4. Nepotism5. Merit - Surprisingly we have many meritorious students still opting for the medical stream in India despite the lack of the above four pointsWhat goes into actually getting through medical school is totally different but what helps the most among the points mentioned is Point 5. Of course the other factors never really cease to exist once admitted to medical school.To get an idea of what it means to be a medical student the following answers may give you an insight.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to How is life as a medical student?Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to What are some tips for a medical student about medical school?Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Do medical students enjoy their life?The process of becoming a doctor is a lot more tougher job than just putting your foot into the door.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Most of my seniors said study hard for your entrance exams since its so hard to crack them. I'm sure most interns would study anyway as a default. I wouldn't stress on that aspect.I would say use your internship to prioritize your career goals.What do you want to be?Sometimes this question is asked too late in a medical student's life.To prioritize your medical career you need to use your internship as career sampling. More than knowing what to take as a specialty you should know what not to take.Few things I think might help you in that1. Keep an open mind. Never get bogged down by other people's opinions about what you should do. What you do is your business not your uncle's or neighbor auntie's.2. No work is too small. Take up every role that you come across. Cleaning a colostomy tube is as important as putting in the colostomy tube through surgery.3. Respect the patient. Work towards making them better always and try your best not to hurt them.  Always remember that patients are your best teachers so give them as much respect as you would your teachers.4. Take ownership of your patient. You might be just an intern who follows your unit head's orders but the patient is still yours. Try to create a personal bond between you and your patient. It always helps you and the patient. Both sides get what they want.5. Medicine is art. Work hard in the wards. Your books will only take you so far but the warfield (wards) is where you learn the craft. Never belittle any ward procedures. IV lines, central lines, urinary catheterization ,repair of emergency lacerations..... You never know what you will come across in the wards. These skills you can never acquire or experience later. I did one central line during my internship and that experience was exhilarating. Being an ophthalmologist now I'll never do it again so I'm thankful I did it then. Wards and patients will give you all the inspiration you need to propel you towards a speciality.6. Make your peace with death and disease.Until you reach internship you never realize how much death and disease of your patients can affect you. This is because you will have a personal investment on the patient. You will sometimes feel helpless in the face of mortality and morbidity but that is necessary.7. Find your role models. It could be anybody you work with and even your own batchmate who has probably figured it out better than yourself. One is never short of people to look up to.8. Recognize the wrong people. You will come across people who are not good at their job, people who insult and look down on their colleagues and juniors, people who are unethical and so on. Identify those people and make note to yourself never to be like them. Do not let a bad doctor ruin a good speciality option for you. I didn't have good teachers for ophthalmology in my medical school but I didn't let it spoil my opinion of ophthalmology.9. Maintain your sense of wonderI feel we need to find wonder in what we do and work towards what we want to be. I would advise the same during one's internship. Never lose that wonder.Good luck. Always remember you will never get to be an intern ever again. Use it well",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"If you don't cloud your life choices with all the emotional baggage that some of the other answers are alluding to there is a simple way here. To look at it objectively. It is a matter of perspective. You should look at what your parents are spending for you as interest free loan. Instead of taking a student loan and be ridden with debt, let your parents spend on it. Ask your parents the figure that they would want to get paid back. Pay it back slowly when you have the means to. Your parents will not act like loan sharks nor will they penalise you if you default or delay.We can't really choose our parents so you have to make the best with what you have been given. In a way, this could be a blessing in disguise. You will be smart and careful about your expenditure because now it is your own money you will be spending. Interest free loanYou get better educated and more in a position to pay the money back.It is almost like you educated yourselfI doubt your parents would claim back each and every penny they've spent on you. You should consider yourself lucky that your parents have money to educate you. Paying back money is better than not having any money at all.Any other alternative is not going to make your position any better. Good luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"It's not really about being content with oneself. It is about being on the cutting edge. I am assuming by the question's terminology that the context is India.Numbers Numbers NumbersThere are scores of doctors who are content with just their undergraduate degree. Some don't have a choice. 56,000 MBBS graduates pass out every year and there are around 14,000 Residency slots (MD/MS/DNB) (Govt+Pvt) combined in India. There are about 3000-4000 slots for post-doctoral Fellowships (Mch/DM/DNB/Fellowship). So not everyone can get into super-speciality even if they are ambitious about it.The competition is immense as you can see. AIPGMEE has 1,50,000 people writing their exams for about 4000 Govt. Residency slots. It is one of the toughest exams in the world to crack even though I say so.In India, we are always battling numbers. Even when you get out of a prestigious residency, you have to prove you have something more than the other 14,000 residents passing out. How valuable you are?To become more valuable you need to be in more niche a field and that goes for Indian doctors too. Because the slots truly worth getting are limited and many people vying for that same slot.Limited work potentialIn many countries, GPs make a lot more than many specialists. Being a generalist is more viable if you are willing to get out of big cities in those countries. But in India to practice out of big cities very difficult and many times it is not very feasible nor profitable. In most cases doctors are forced by circumstance and government rules to go to the villages rather than as a choice.Say you want to be a general surgeon in a big city in India. You would end up doing fissurectomies, hemorroidectomies, hydroceles and if you are lucky a hernia repair- if the patient is poor. All the scut work no one else wants to do will land up with you. All the cutting edge work will go to the super-specialists. People who have unlimited income are not unlimited, so a person who can afford it will go to the best possible person for a particular surgery. In Ophthalmology, which is my speciality if one doesn't do a fellowship, he will be lucky to do even cataract surgery regularly and that too if he's in government service.I've done two clinical fellowships after my residency and that's not because I'm not content with myself- It is because I want my work to stand above the mediocre.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm an ophthalmolgist so I guess I will be a little biased towards Ophthalmology.The ProsOphthalmology is a fascinating subject. When I first took up Ophthalmology I never realized the field was so vast for such a small organ. It is vast but fascinating all the same. It is nothing short of a miracle to know how such a complex organ like the eye works perfectly and in sync with the other eye.It has multiple subspecialties- Cornea, Cataract, Retina, Pediatric & Strabismus, Oculoplastics, Neuro-ophthalmology, Uveitis &Ocular Immunology. Each of them are as fascinating as any of the other. You will have a tough time in choosing a subspecialty. This may also be a reason a lot of people end up being general ophthalmologists where they get to see all kinds of diseases.No other speciality will dare try to treat an eye case. Even in a bridging speciality like mine-Oculoplastics, they leave the eyelid and orbit to my expertise.Diagnosis of eye conditions are extremely difficult without years of training. Being an expert in your sub-field is of enormous value and pretty cool when you can do stuff not many can.I would differ with Mitul Mehta with regard to saving lives. Saving vision is as important as saving lives. I look at it like this: Somebody's livelihood and independence is dependent on vision. So by saving vision I am actually saving their life. Also me being an eye cancer specialist I do get to save a lot people from death by eye cancer. A lot of patients are small little kids. The good news is most eye cancers except maybe stage 4 high grade lymphoma have very good prognosis.Not seeing death often. That for me is a great advantage in my speciality. Loss of life is very hard for a doctor to take in and I'm happy I don't need to see it as often as my ER colleagues.Ophthalmology is a wonderful mix of medicine and surgery. You can be a physician and a surgeon at the same time.Can settle for fixed hours if you opt out of eye trauma care and are only affiliated to one hospital, pretty much all of your surgical cases are elective.You can play with cool gadgets all the time. It was one of the reasons I took up Ophthalmology. Machines make it tremendously exciting branch. Microscopes, OCT machines, Laser machines, Navigational surgeries, etc....the list is just endless.It is an amazing feeling when you can do surgery under microscopes and using sutures which are thinner than hair and sometimes impossible to see with the naked eye.Some of my positive experiences in ophthalmology are in this answer Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Why do people say becoming a doctor is not a good way to make money?ConsIn a lot of eye diseases like Glaucoma, Retinal diseases, orbital diseases we cannot really correct the underlying pathology but we can only control the effects of the disease. We have got very good at it and are getting better at it every passing day. Unfortunately we are not close to eradicating any disease yet. Once the vision is lost due to neurological disease or destruction of the retina it is nearly impossible to reverse the damage.Good quality subspecialty fellowships are pretty hard to get and highly competitive. In India it is very difficult. For example in a large country like India there are only 3 oculoplastics fellowships and only one of them has quality training. I had to go to Singapore to train in oculoplastics. I'm not sure about the US but from what I hear from my US based cousins in US it is equally hard and competitive. Mitul Mehta can help with this info.Ophthalmologists are made fun of by our ER and other surgery colleagues and clubbed with dermats and GPs. I suspect the ribbing is a compensatory mechanism for the jealousy they have about us. :-)It is pretty hard to establish a subspecialty practice in India as the common public do not recognize the subtleties of this field and its various forms of expertise. People (including some doctors) think all that ophthalmologists do is prescribe glasses with some of them doing cataract surgery. Which is of course untrue but fighting the perception is not very easy. This may not apply in the US.On the balance of things I have never ever regretted choosing Ophthalmology and I have taken to it like a fish to water. I encourage many people to take up this speciality. Do ask any other questions you have about Ophthalmology. I'm happy to answer.Thanks for the A2A Mitul Mehta",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Surprising to many- not much! Our eyes are designed to self-service itself. Just the act of blinking has several functions:It lubricates the eye with tearsIt forms a layer of optically smooth surface for you to have clear vision.It contains antibacterial substances and enzymes which protects the eyeballs against infections and inflammation.It cleans the eye of dust particles and dirt just like a wiper of your car.​​​If your body is healthy, your eyes will be too.Everything that is required for a healthy lifestyle also applies to the eyes. A balanced antioxidant rich dietRegular exercise7-8hrs of uninterrupted sleepPositive attitude.Eyes are the windows to the bodyOne of the very less known facts about the eyes is that many of the effects of diseases in the body- Diabetes, Hypertention, auto-immune diseases, brain disorders,etc- can be observed by looking at the eye with a microscope.  Many diseases can be diagnosed by examining the eyes with certain instruments. This video by national geographic is a brilliant demonstration of what I'm saying.​http://video.nationalgeographic....However modern lifestyles can give rise to several occupational problems.Computer vision syndrome.With the advent of modern technology and our work involving spending long durations staring at screens, it does impact the eye. Staring at bright screens causes you to blink less causing your corneas to dry up. Eyes drying up causes corneal epithelial erosions which causes irritation. When you sleep the corneal epithelium heals and hence you feel better after that rest. The ways to counter this problem would be To use over the counter tear substitutes which are preservative free. (Genteal /Refresh Plus) for symptomatic relief.But mainly one has to make a lifestyle medication to improve one's dry eye condition. Do not work with screens for more than one hour at a stretch. Take a break every 45-60 mins for 5 mins and close your eyes for that period and then focus on some distant object and then resume working on your computer. Also whenever you stare at screens blink more often (and you have to do that consciously).Self Diagnosis over GoogleThis is also a hazard of modern living. I have at least two newly minted software engineers coming to my office every week thinking they are smarter than all doctors because they know how to google stuff on the internet. I'm bemused that they treat internet like some God having all the answers to life's problems. Sorry to burst the bubble- not everything on the internet is true just because it is there. The reliability of the source is important. There will be several websites claiming if you instill 'cow urine' into your eye that will cure you of 'eye disease'. That doesn't make it true!Protection against external traumaIt is a very important aspect and I would like to stress that protection to the eye and head is very important. Many eye and face injuries can be prevented by just using helmets while riding bicycles, motorbikes and other activities which involve a high risk of falling down. Using eye protection while playing contact sports or any sport where injury to the eye is a possibility is important. For reference read about how the cricketing careers of Saba Karim and Mark Boucher ended.Protective eye gear while working in hazardous occupations like welding, polishing and grinding cannot be overstated. It prevents unnecessary hospital visits.Finally I would like to conclude by saying that your eyes are delicate but robust organs. Despite that when you have an eye problem consult an Ophthalmologist and not the computer.Thanks for the A2A Surya Vasisht",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Sunken eyes are a result of laxity of skin around the eyes and atrophy of fat surrounding the eyeballs. These are age related changes and one cannot turn back the clock so as to speak by just taking some herbal treatment or other so called ""natural"" methods. The picture below gives the difference between a youthful and an ageing face.Another reason to have sunken eyes in the young is when a person loses a lot of weight in a short period of time. When people lose weight they lose weight all over their body including around the eyes. But the good news is it can be taken care of with new age methods. Non surgical treatments for sunken eyes include  Radio frequency skin tightening, Laser resurfacing and chemical peels. These give some benefit but it is not long lasting or 100% effective in all cases. Some of these treatments may not be effective in very severe cases.Mildly invasive procedures include fillers and fat transfer. These give short term benefit and then one might have to repeat the procedures regularly to keep the look.Surgery gives longer lasting and more effective results. Of course no surgery is without risks. One has to be mindful of those when considering surgery. Surgical options for sunken eyes include. Blepharoplasty-upper or/and lower eyelid, brow- lift, Mid-face lift and various other plastic surgery procedures depending on what needs to be fixed.Also be informed that most of these procedures maybe deemed cosmetic unless the doctor can show a medical reason for surgery. For example, an upper lid blepharoplasty may be deemed medical if the sagging eyelids obstructs the field of vision.An ophthalmic plastic surgeon may best advice you regarding what might be the best options for you.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Simple reason: There's nothing quite like home.If given a choice no one would want to move out of places that they live in unless the benefits are manifold more than their hometown or they are forced to move out of their hometown.Why NRIs settle down among other IndiansFamiliarity and routine is of paramount importance to many Indians. That is why everywhere they go around the world they settle down in pockets where many Indians are living. New Jersey, Chicago, London, Birmingham, Southhall... This ghettoization (for the lack of a better word) is inherent in our Indian culture. We want to carry a part of India to where ever we go and expect our children also to be as Indianized as possible. It is not necessarily a bad thing but explains why most Indians want to live in India.Outside India you are an alienIt is also nearly impossible for you to assimilate into the foreign culture as much as a native can. Maybe an immigrant's children will have better luck with assimilation.So no matter how accomplished you may become and maybe even a citizen in your adopted country, one is always viewed as a foreigner. Even you will feel like one even after 20 years of living in the adopted country.IsolationI visited my cousins in Chicago and New Jersey last year. They live in the suburbs which is about 50 miles from the city, travel to the city everyday for work and they spend their regular weekends watching TV because going to the city during weekends is such a chore. Their nearest relative was at least 1000 miles away whom they haven't seen in more than a year. At that time I wondered if I would be happy living 12,000kms away from home seeing my parents and other family members maybe once every 2 years and the only advantage I get would be better roads, vacations and internet connection?FYI- New York train stations stink like crazy, their sidewalks are plastered with chewing gum and I have not seen so many homeless people living in any Indian city!

I have liked nearly every one of the other places but I never felt quite like home. It has been a wonderful experience to know so many cultures. I especially look with fondness at the time I spent in Mysore and Kolkata. Singapore is an amazing city and a great place to live in. A city where everything works, you have a wonderful work-life balance, spendid infrastructure and if you make a decent living you generally have a more than decent life. I had a wonderful mentor and other colleagues at work. They all urged me to stay back in Singapore. Despite all this I never felt I was part of them- that unspoken line was always present between us. We (my wife and I) decided to return back to Bangalore to make a living here.Whenever I'm frustratingly stuck in a traffic jam in Bangalore these days, I sometimes wish I was still living in Singapore using it's excellent public transport system.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I have been following Shashi Tharoor from a long time. Even before his work for the UN got highlighted. I was reading his news columns and books for a long time. I am a huge fan of his writing. I will dwell on the positives first:1. An exemplary writer of the English language. His use of the language is unmatched by even the greatest of his generation. Pity he wrote mostly non-fiction. But if I were to name gifted writers I would place him among John Irving, PG Wodehouse, Mark Twain and Edgar Allan Poe for the delightful way one could use language.2. A great thinker and a visionary. His intelligence is unquestionable. He knew enough about India to actually plan a road map for progress. Before he decided to become a politician I had thought to myself we need people like these in politics. Educated, suave, accomplished, articulate and intelligent.3. Had a certain charisma not usually seen among Bureaucrats and Diplomats. He clearly stood out from a pack of invisible people. He seemed special4. He's witty. Whether its his writing or his tweets. I got a twitter account just to follow his tweets. I really appreciate his sense of humor.5. A brilliant ambassador and a model citizen. If ever one had to talk about India and Indians he would be the ideal person to promote India to the world. Even his worst detractors would agree that he is a pragmatic personality worthy of admiration.Negative aspects1. He is a poor politician. He was intelligent no doubt but Indian Politics works on a Mai-baap culture especially in the parochial Congress Party atmosphere. I get the feeling that he's stifled in the party. They had to accord him respect so gave him a ticket but they never intended to keep him part of the discourse. He would have made an excellent External Affairs Minister with cabinet rank but he was never made into one.2. For a man of his intelligence he was very short sighted. The IPL controversy and other business interests showed that he really wasn't above board than the other politicians when it comes to acquiring soft assets. He tried to use his new found position to maneuver the Kochi IPL deal to his benefit. The sweat stocks leave a bloody trail. He was just smart enough to escape repercussions but lost a lot of credibility.3. His love story with Sunada Pushkar was cute to start with but he messed it up with her in the end. Clearly things weren't hunky-dory on the love front when Sunada literally dropped dead. We don't know the exact circumstances that lead to her death and it is being investigated but Tharoor's position is not looking good.4. The articulate man that he was he did not sometimes know when to keep his mouth shut. A lot of criticism on his tweets are unjustified I agree. Even people within his party don't have his sense of humor. But when he chose to be in that party he should have kept ""his cattle"" to himself on some occasions.5. A very poor mass leader. His followers are the educated elite and upper middle class. That is why he is an MP from an educated Kerala. His charm has little appeal to the majority of the population who are uneducated or barely literate. His use of language is lost on them.On the balance of it I would say that Shashi Tharoor was a wasted politician and maybe a leader ahead of his time. He clearly did not fit into the political mix of our country. He would have been far more useful in an advisory role than a politician and of course I wish he wrote a little more than he has now. :-)",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"There are two parts of your question1. Should Management seats exist in medical colleges in India?2. Are the students who get in with capitation as capable as the ones who get in through merit?I have mixed feelings about management seats in Medical colleges. In an ideal world there would be a fair meritocracy in all aspects of education. But unfortunately we don't live in that ideal world and ground realities need to be factored inCost of Medical EducationMedical education doesn't come cheap. American medical students get out of medical school with a debt of $300-500,000 and their counterparts in Singapore have a  debt of about S$200,000.

As an example Manipal University which provides top-notch medical education and infrastructure charges fees of about Rs. 10,00,000/yr ( US$100,000 for a full course). Manipal University doesn't receive government subsidies like many other private medical colleges.How government subsidy is not enoughAs you can see medical education is very expensive even in India. The medical education in government medical colleges in India is heavily subsidized. To make sure that we have enough meritorious students among doctors the government provides subsidy and tax breaks to private medical colleges. This helps but is not enough to make medical education affordable to everyone. I did my MBBS in a private medical college on government subsidized merit seat under general merit.The fee structure in my college was like this (Year 2002)General Merit slots (15% of the seats)- Rs. 16,200 annuallyReservation slots (35%)- Rs. 16,200 annuallyMerit-cum-payment slots (35%)- Rs. 122,000 annuallyManagement slots (15%) - Rs. 20-30 Lakh upfront plus Rs. 122,000 annually.This fee structure has meant that people like me - a student from a middle class background with limited means was able to afford to become a doctor. If I was left to the very fair merit based but open market, people like me could never hope to become doctors. I would never have taken up medicine paying Rs. 50  Lakh as fees. I would have probably taken up Engineering in NIT, IIT etc. This subsidy in fees sponsored by the rich in my class has what has resulted in me becoming a doctorRaghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Which college should I join for an MBBS, KMC Mangalore or GMC Yavatamal? (Please read details)Are management medical students capable?Medical education in India is quite rigourous. This is because the field is ruthless and competitive. Getting into a medical college is the easiest part of becoming a doctor.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Which is more difficult, medical school or getting into medical school?Only 110 students out of the total 150 in my class cleared their 1st year exams. The 40 who failed comprised not only of Management students. Many students from each category of fee structure were present in this failure group including people from general merit. So just starting merit won't cut it. Many of my management slot classmates turned out to be very good medical students and later went on to be very accomplished doctors. Conversely many of the general merit classmates lost their way in between and didn't amount to much. The proof is in the pudding. Everything depends on how a student uses the opportunities. Money helps but only up to a point, after that it is all aptitude that carries that student forward. Fortunately, medicine doesn't encourage mediocrity. Doctors truly successful in medicine are passionate enough to be good at what they do. It is almost Darwinian ""survival of the fittest""The down sides of high cost of medical education in IndiaWhen a student in India is paying so much for medical education the financial compensation is disappointing. Students have to pay first world college fees and getting back third world salaries.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to What is the salary of a doctor in India?Median salary for each level of specialization in India is:Post MBBS- Rs. 10,000 to 40,000/month (5.5 years of training)Post MD/MS - Rs. 30,000 to 2,00,000/ month ( 9-12years of training)Post DM/Mch/Fellowship - Rs. 50,000 to 3,00,000/month. (12-15 years of training)With this reality being the case, to increase revenue, corruption will creep in through all directions. This doesn't happen in developed countries because the financial compensation is at least moderately compensated. Bottom lineUnless we can come up with a better system to train doctors at low individual cost while being proportionately compensated once training is over, we have to embrace this dichotomy of cost. It is not perfect but it is a compromise we have to accept.Thanks for the A2A Dipkanya Das",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"A surgeon's schedule-at least a younger surgeon's- is never set in stone. Every day is quite unpredictable. Broadly I would say my day depends on whether I have a full clinic session or a surgical session or a mixture of both. Also on some days I have to attend academic sessions.My morning schedule:I get up quite early at around 5:30-6am. Go for a jog. I read the newspaper quite religiously for half an hour, then take a shower and get ready. Depending on the day and when I have to be at work I either take breakfast at home or at work. If I have an academic session I have to be at the hospital by 7:30- 8am depending on the session otherwise I land up in my clinic at 8:30-9:00amHospital Schedule:Academic sessions: Presentations, Tumour boards and Discussions with Colleagues and Residents.Clinic Sessions: where we see patients with fresh complaints/on follow up/ post-operative visits.Surgical sessions: Where we list all the surgeries that we do. My usual working day is a combination of the above three. It varies a lot depending on the combination. I have a working lunch somewhere in between at work (sometimes packed from home). My working day starts at 7:30 am and ends at 6-8 pm depending on the list. Then there are some emergencies I attend to sometimes. I also have to put the obnoxious Bangalore traffic to the mix. (I wish I owned a helicopter)Night Schedule:A perfect night schedule would be the following. (though for reasons I mentioned above it is quite flexible sometimes as unpredictable as my work)Home at 8 pm. Have Dinner. Say a cheerful ""Hi"" to my wife back from work. (not really in that order if you know what I mean!). Read any newspaper I had left out in the morning.(yeah I realize that this is a crazy obsession), Browse/answer emails, browse the net checking random things (yes even I do it,don't judge me), Check Quora and spend about an hour (or two) reading and answering (this is a new addiction which don't get me brownie points with my wife :-( ), watch an episode of some good TV series (not a regular habit, only sometimes).

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"As a start I would recommend you read this book. ​​​This book written by a practicing Harvard surgeon, Dr. Atul Gawande is an eye opener in the field of end-of-life care. I would assume you are talking about a relative when you talk about the person in the death bed. Often a medical student's first challenge is to make peace with disease and death.Learn about Hospice care. The quality of life is more important than prolongation of life. These are the places which might help achieve that.I would suggest the following in your case:Have a frank conversation with him. Determine his goals as what he wants to achieve before he dies. This is hard but is the most important and most helpful thing you can do to him. Give him a timeline based on what the treating oncologist says about the prognosis. He needs to know how much time he has.Pain relief is more important than giving treatment in a patient with uncontrollable cancer. So if the chemo/radiation/surgery is not going to improve quality of life or save him from death then it is useless. Help him in seeing that.Your role in this case is not as a doctor but as a conduit between the vast number of his doctors and patient. You need to help him make his medical choices. Be his health advocateKeep him cheerful and happy. Do not let other family members say hurtful things. Often people do not realize that being negative and crying around people on their deathbed actually makes them guilty and hurt. Good luck.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"It is a very pertinent question and something I have mulled over from time to time. Being an Ocular Oncologist I deal with a lot of pediatric eye cancers. There this thought doesn't arise since healthcare decisions are taken by parents and diagnosis of cancer is the first starting point for discussion of further treatment.Things get difficult when the patient is older. But I believe in the idiom the ""we need to place the patient at the centre of every treatment decision"". Cancer treatment is not black and white. It has several shades of grey.The pros and cons of treatment- Surgery, Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy or a combination thereof is never simple decisions and it is always individualized to suit each patient. Here it is not only important to know whether the patient is fit for the treatment considered appropriate but also patient goals are very important. The patient cannot take objective decisions if the patient is not given full information about his/her cancer diagnosis and it's prognosis. We doctors always aim to keep the patient alive. But this sometimes unfortunately comes at a cost. The only person who can decide whether the cost is worth it- is the patient.The problem of lots of informationThe patient usually is not really as interested nor understand what the cancer is all about and it's treatment. They need your diagnosis, it's progonosis and whether they can be treated. The pros and cons of treatment and whether they can accept the cons. I'm usually forthright with all the information including diagnosis with the patient (if above 18 years) or parents (if pediatric) or both (if somewhere in between). I state my professional opinion and what I think is the best possible option but I believe in giving my patients more than one option. I place a lot of importance on the patients making the decisions and not me serving as proxy.Problems unique to many Asian countries especially IndiaPatients in the US, UK, Australia etc. take many decisions themselves. It is not unusual for a 90yr old american gentleman taking all decisions regarding his prostate cancer without even consulting his family. But in India and other Asian countries family takes all decisions collectively. That may not always be a good thing but something doctors in this region cannot escape from. Lot of old patients in my practice often need the younger family members- siblings, children, grandchildren- to decide on treatment decisions. It is sometimes difficult to explain and for them to understand all the pros and cons of the treatment.Myth Vs RealityIt is not really true that all people break down when informed that they have cancer or that they might be dying if not treated. I believe the stress of not knowing what's happening is far worse because then the patient is losing control over one's own selves. They would be far less emotional when they know what is wrong and if there are ways to fix it. My PracticeI always try to tell the patient what they have- Cancer/Not Cancer. Family members many times request me not to reveal more than necessary for treatment. I do respect it sometimes for very old patients because their knowing/not knowing may not impact their treatment much. But if I have to take a decision on something dicey and need to discuss it, the patient knowing his diagnosis, Prognosis and Treatment options in view of the previous  two is important. His/her life goals are very important. Needless to say the patient has to be in a position to take an informed decision of course. The patient's family comes in only when there is a question of cost- in terms of money of the said treatment and how the family will support the patient before and after treatment.We have tumour boards which discuss these kinds of dicey cases where there is a team of specialists- Medical/ Radiation Oncologists, Surgical Oncologists (preferably including a sub-specialist in that particular cancer) and other allied specialists in different fields including Onco-Psychology. This gives a holistic approach to treatment and Patient gets the most appropriate care. Here of course it is important that the patient has only one primary doctor and all information goes through a single doctor.Some extra readingI was very enlightened by a book I read- Being Mortal by Atul Gawande- An american surgeon who writes about the perils of ""doing everything"" during end of life care. When to and when not to proceed with all guns blazing. Some really brilliant perspective to one of the least discussed aspects of Medicine.​​​Of course many of those things he discusses cannot be applied in India where cost/ education/ social status are huge factors influencing decisions.The important rule of thumb for a doctor:In the end your patient is the person who has the cancer and not his/her relatives. You have to serve as your patient's health-care advocate and not the family members'.I like Dr.Vinay Kumaran's excellent answer to the same question. He hits all the right buttons. I'm not as gifted as him in being concise in my thoughts and writings so please read his answer as well to gain extra perspective.Vinay Kumaran's answer to Do you, as a doctor, tell a patient that he/she is suffering from cancer, if their family request you not to?",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm not an art expert but I think i can answer this question with two examples of artists who changed their styles due to visual impairment due to eye disease. The two artists are Claude Monet (cataracts) and Edgar Degas (retinal disease). Dr. Micheal Marmor of Stanford University has done considerable work in demystifying their artistic stylesCataract is the clouding of the eye's natural lens causing decrease in visual acuity. Retinal disease causes irreversible decline in visual acuity.Claude MonetHe reached the peak of his work in the later part of his life. He was known to suffer from cataracts since 1900 and he got operated later in 1923 at the age of 82. His famous blurry style is known to be the product of his cataracts.Claude Monet painted “Waterlily Pond,” in 1899. His vision problems with cataracts didn’t begin until 1912.A current photograph of the same bridge, blurred as it might appear to someone with a moderate cataract.Edgar DegasDegas’ vision started deteriorating starting at the age of 36 around late 1870s it was affecting his work quite a bit. He suffered from extreme glare, photophobia and suffered a lot due to vision problem and he had accepted his visual deterioration when he was around 40 years of age.Edgar Degas completed this pastel titled “Woman Combing Her Hair,” in 1886. During the mid-1880s, he first began to talk about his “infirmity of sight.”By the time Degas completed “Woman Drying Her Hair” in 1905, his eyesight had dropped to somewhere between 20/200 and 20/400. Marmor notes that after 1900, there was virtually no detailing of faces or clothing in Degas’ artwork.Marmor used computer software to blur the image in “Woman Drying Her Hair” to a visual acuity of 20/300 to replicate what Degas might have seen.Apparently even Rembrandt, Mary Cassatt and Georgia O'Keefe reached the peak of their profession while suffering from visual problems. References and image sources:Claude Monet and Ultraviolet Light.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I think it was early in my InternshipMy first posting was in OBGYN. I was one month in and internship seemed like medical school but with the added work of departmental Gopher!""go fetch the reports"""" check if the IV bottle is empty every 2 seconds""""The intern messed it up"" ""Hold this bloody retractor""and all suchThe second month was where the action was. I was put on Labour ward duties and man did it rain pregnant ladies.Two interns, Two residents and four nurses.16 ladies every night on the chairThe Consultant on call was permanently in scrubs in the OT and a resident and intern running up and down in turn alternating between Labour room and OT.This fateful night. It was raining heavily. My co-intern got sick and she called that she wasn't coming in. I was angry as hell. I'm watching over 4 ladies in different stages of labour and driving me nuts and my only hope of a wink during the night was taken away by my colleague.Bad news. Just then a lady in her last trimester but still 4 weeks from her due date landed at the hospital with systemic infection and probably going for multi organ dysfunction. She also had preecclampsia for which she was being treated in another hospital. She was referred to our hospital when things took a downturn. The resident said he'll take over the labour ward duties and told me to assist the other resident to admit the patient to the ICU and monitor. Many specialists from different departments came in and all of them barked several orders to me. I think the OBGYN resident and me were the only two people who knew what was going on. More bad news.Then lightening struck twice. The resident was called into OT for an emergency C-section on another patient. The resident repeated all the instructions to me twice before running off to OTI had to measure her BP and pulse rate every 15mins and monitor blood, antibiotics and IV fluids on a minute to minute basis. I was supposed to fill in forms and send blood work every hour. Requisition chest X ray and USG abdomen. All this while monitoring the fetus which was thankfully still alive despite all this.I somehow found the energy to do all the above and I surprised myself with how much work I could get done under pressure. It then struck me that if something unexpected happened I had no clue what to do. I tried to calm myself thinking the Anaesthesia resident is still in the room if something happened. But it wasn't looking good. Suddenly in the midst of it all, the patient woke up and looked at me. She couldn't speak so she looked downwards asking about her kid. I reassured her  that the kid is alright. Tears started rolling out of her eyes. I was totally unprepared for this. I didn't know what to do. I grabbed her hand and sat down next to her. If I believed in God I would have been praying all night to get the three of us-the mother, her kid and me- through the night. I didn't, but I kept doing whatever I was supposed to be doing and kept holding her hand whenever I could. I didn't sleep the whole night and never felt like it.Good news. We got through the night and I was still holding her hand in the morning. Her vitals and blood work was getting better. She improved exponentially over the next couple of days and her pre-eclampsia dictated that we go for an elective C-section. By this time I had got to know the patient and her family quite well. I was going off- duty when her C-section was scheduled. The patient requested me to come in with the team for the surgery and requested as much to the Consultant in charge. She had a near uneventful C-section. The consultant impressed at my work with this patient over the last few days (corroborated by the residents) gave me the opportunity to pull out the baby from the womb.My heart was beating hard when I pulled the baby girl out and it was converted to relief as I passed her onto the pediatric resident. I could feel life literally in my hands. I felt for the first time in my life that I was someone's doctor.Thanks for the A2A Sanmitra AiholliI enjoyed reliving that entire experience.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Life of a 21st century doctor!Edit:I shall tell my perspective of being a doctor in India. It may not apply to doctors in other countries but one always finds common threadsThe medical science has seen a sea change over the last century…..more than what has been achieved in the previous 5 centuries put together. The change has been for the better for patients as people are getting cured of diseases which previously had no cures. In this state of change to expect the medical profession not to change is simply naive. I would like to enumerate the good, the bad and the ugly of the medical profession in general and the joys and challenges of doctors in particular. This is in no way a negative or cynical post. It is more of a perspective of how things are and how it is going to be.Medical EducationOver the years the field has grown leaps and bounds and this being the era of super specialization…..now doctors are moving on to micro specialization. It has become harder for students to keep up to the whole gamut of information which keeps changing every few years so “specialization in minutiae is inevitable” is  the new world order for doctors. I agree with this in principle but the path to specialization especially in India is difficult, unrewarding and involves a lot of factors unrelated to your capability to be a good doctor. First on the list comes low pay right from the time a medical graduate passes out. This pay never reaches the amount appropriate to his/her level of expertize all through their career unless he/she indulges in any wrong practices or his/her family owns a hospital. Second is the high cost of medical education not only monetarily but in the quality of life a medical student has to endure throughout his student life. An equally capable professional in another field is pretty much well set by the time a doctor can come out to practice and by which time the doctor has a mountain of debt and an unforgiving society. There is very little incentive for a student in India to join the medical profession unless their family owns a hospital or have unending disposable income to spend. This puts the profession beyond the reach of the middle class since there are no returns for the incredible amount of mental and financial investment required from a doctor. So is it any surprise with the quality and character of the doctors of the new era. The brightest and smartest don’t want to become doctors since it’s simply not reasonable for a middle class family to sustain a medical student. This makes way for corruption and only the people with the insane amounts of money can become doctors in the new era. Are these the kind of doctors you want to trust your lives with? Those fortunate to be bright enough enough to secure a government medical/ residency seats which they can afford are treated so shabbily by the system. They are often put up in slum like living condition in hostels with bug infested rooms, mosquitoes and the works by government colleges. They are often made to work 80-100hrs a week resulting poor nutrition and low morale. A lot of them end up sick and in extreme cases even dead. On top of that, the added danger of flash mobs assaulting the emergency doctors on call. The general feeling is the residents are often disgusted with the system and with their seniors for perpetuating this unfair system. This is how the brightest in the field are treated by the society. Some links below which might give an idea of how big the problem is. https://in.news.yahoo.com/why-in...http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/r...The specialist doctor problemThese days everyone wants to be treated by the specialist. To a lay person it might seem like the most correct thing to do and may feel that a super specialist is very accomplished hence also the most capable to treat his disease. In practice however it is a huge waste of resources. In most patient surveys around India and the world 80% of the sickness can be treated at the primary healthcare point. The consequences of making the cardiologist treat a common cold is that the patient is wasting a cardiologist’s expertise and overpaying his consultation as well. People don’t realize the importance of a general practitioner or general physician in their healthcare. This discourages newly minted medical professionals from taking up general practice. It is just not viable for them. What is the government doing about this problem. They are completely ignoring the issue and like they have treated primary education, they are treating primary healthcare with the same disdain. They aren’t hiring permanent staff for their rural areas and those hired are paid salaries once in 6 months. They are forcibly making new residents serve in rural areas. This again is a huge waste of valuable resources. Orthopedic surgeons are doubling up as midwives and delivering babies in rural areas since there are no other doctors. How will this change our primary healthcare in anyway? GPs are not average doctors as people would like to think. They have a different set of skills than a super specialist. While a super specialist is restricted to a very narrow field of medicine the GP is trained to look at the patient as a whole. More amazing diagnoses is made in a GPs chamber than a neurosurgeon’s. But in the new era this important medical community is dwindling.Quality of life of a DoctorI’m not saying it is the toughest job on earth but a doctors life now harder than it has ever been. Very few vacations- no money during student life and no time once you are practicing. Family suffers. My father is a doctor and all through my childhood I resented the fact that we took so few family vacations and that my father was never there for the most important events in school or others. All the while he was working day and night to make ends meet and ensure that we, his children get the right education, amenities and taken care of. This made sure that I was a reluctant doctor for the most part of medical school. I eventually found my calling and was “reformed” but it was a painful journey nonetheless. It is going to get worse for the future generations. There is this underlying myth that doctors make a lot of money during their careers which is really not true. I had a conversation with a friend from the money making tech industries and he had this to say “Doctors can’t contribute enough financially to the nation to command higher salaries. A doctor ONLY saves lives but engineers,financial analysts and CEOs create wealth which they distribute among themselves.” This is how much value saving lives commands. I was angry at what he said at first but later realized this is how the money creating industries think of doctors: overpaid and untrustworthy. Life and death can’t be quantified in stocks and bonds and hence that is not enough. It made me sad as to how this came to pass and this perception is precisely what the next generation of doctors will have to work against. Governments post newly minted doctors into rural areas on compulsory postings but on temporary jobs. It is cheap labor for the exchequer, vote banks are taken care of and they don’t have to bother about a permanent solution for a complex problem like rural health. What these people don’t realize is that by having this attitude they will ultimately increase healthcare costs and then everybody suffers. This inability of the society to acknowledge their altruism will be the reason to discourage the next generation of brilliant students from taking up this unforgiving profession. Doctors are no more demigods or authorities in their field. Their medical decisions will be altered by arm twisting untrusting patients, fear of malpractice suits, defensive medicine, target hounding corporate hospitals, a populist government and an inefficient tlaw system. All this stress while their family still suffers from the lack of their time and money. What I wish I knew: Advice for spouses of doctors and residentsDoctor and patient relationshipTo a doctor who is just starting out I would say this: ‘ Your decisions will be questioned at every step. You cannot dismiss patients like you are doing a favor to them. You will have to get down to the level of the patient and sometimes lower’. It will be a big let down in a doctor’s life that they keep having their motives questioned every day of their professional lives. I think this is for the better as the doctor community has been too arrogant for far too long. They spend so little time with patients giving the excuse of long patient lists and surgeries. I think this is why people are so distrusting of what we do. Doctors of the new era have to respect the “new patient” who is educated, informed and has 1000 questions. There will be unreasonable patients just like other professionals have unreasonable clients. You have to approach it like how other professionals do. Any drug that you prescribe you should know all the side effects. Any surgery that you do you should know all possible complications. Ignorance is never an excuse anymore. Its your jib to know. Never be dogmatic and steadfast about your decisions or opinions. Learn humility, patients appreciate that. State your professional opinion clearly before educating your patient about his/her disease and give them more than one choice when possible. Let patients take ownership of the decisions that need to be taken. All this takes time and you would be well advised to give it to them in the first instance or you’ll be forced to give it in court. This sword of Damocles hanging over your head seems very unfair when all you wanted to do was do your job well. There is no point complaining about it and we have to make peace with our present day realities. If we want to be counted as professionals we have to be accountable. Period. Also you need to connect to every patient you meet. For you will have several patients but for a patient you are the only doctor at that point of time. Learn more about your patients and make them feel like you are their doctor rather than make them feel they are your patients. There is a world of a difference in that.http://mattandjennimurray.blogsp...http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewi...Doctors and the mediaDoctors in India are the vilified lot and not for small reason due to the unrelenting attitude of the media to slam doctors at every given opportunity. Media misuse their privilege to become just the loudest voice in the room. Most of the popular channels give out gross wrong health advice, unhealthy diet fads and advertisements of dubious cures. If that was not enough we have enough doctor slamming shows like Satyamev Jayate. Shows like these invite doctors and patients to discussion forums and post recording heavily edit the discussion in a very biased fashion to suit only their pre determined point of view and to create sensationalism to increase the TRPs of their shows. Doctors are the favorite punching bags since doctors in India have no voice. They don’t form vote banks since they are an educated community which can’t be swayed by politicians. They don’t have a lobby to fight these instances of injustice since doctors in general don’t make enough money impact the finance of any political entity. The Indian Medical Association and its state counterparts sometimes have token protests against these wrongs which not surprisingly never gets reported in the media. Doctors in hospital emergency rooms get beaten up every other day almost in all instances for no fault of theirs. This almost barbaric treatment of junior doctors in hospitals across the country are never reported in the media and if reported would highlight “some mistake” on the part of the treating doctors and never anything defending the doctors. This is because in most instances these assaults on doctors are perpetuated or encouraged by media persons. And strangely if there is any instance of a doctor strike  protesting archaic quota system of medical education, low pay or assault of doctors in hospitals, the same  media will come raining down on the doctor community of holding people’s life at ransom. What I’m sad to see is that people don’t realize that doctors are not anarchists.They would be more happy treating patients rather than be in protest rallies and fight lathi charges. If they are forced to do these things one has to realize how desperate and frustrated they are with the system. Nobody else is fighting for them and doctors have no choice but to protest in what little way they can. It is sometimes heart rending to see doctors who are on hunger strikes still running emergency clinics in these protest areas since they don’t want people to suffer.Doctors and DoctorsOver the years in the medical profession I have seen as a young doctor trying to make a mark that doctors work against doctors. There is too much professional jealousy and Godfather complex in the doctor community. There is a culture of disrespect which is passed on from the senior doctors to the junior ones. A senior doctor would not bat an eyelid before running down his junior colleague or rival in front of the patients. When you can’t respect your own profession how can you expect the patient to respect it. Doctors cannot treat their junior colleagues like slaves at their beck and call. If you don’t respect your colleagues the feeling will be mutual. So the first step in the new era will be respect for everyone from medical student to super specialist. While we are at it there should be respect for everyone concerned with your patients….every person in the health delivery system forms a vital cog in the machinery. The future of healthcare is in creating effective teams rather than hierarchy. Things have to change in the near future in India to prevent hierarchy from setting into a system. Only when you remove nepotism , favoritism and godfathers from the picture will we gain a meritorious medical community. Mentors are the need of the day. Only if the present stalwarts mentor the next generation of doctors will there be continued value of our art. But if these stalwarts are insistent on running their personal fiefdoms then its a bleak future ahead.Finally the joys of being a doctorBeing an optimist has helped me still enjoy my profession in a positive way despite the injustices that are being done to doctors in India. Its been a very long road from being a reluctant doctor to an empathetic doctor and this journey has taught me a lot of lessons. One of the joys of being a doctor is having the power to change a person’s life and livelihood with one accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A doctor may not move nations or even sometimes not even impress the patient he’s treating but power to positively impact another person’s life is incredible to say the least and I suspect is the reason why doctors still continue to perfect their art and science. Doctors may not make millions of dollars like lawyers, engineers, management consultants and businessmen but the value they give the society with their work is not measure able with any material affluence.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Kidneys cannot be sold or bought in India. Organ trade has been banned in India since the Human Transplantation Act 1994 has come into force. Kidney transplantation can only happen with donor kidneys. Usually it has to be a live donor who donates one of his kidneys. The latest amendment to the act and rules are available here:Transplantation of Human Organs Act 1994Page on mohfw.nic.inTissue matchingWhen you are waiting for a kidney transplantation , the key to a successful transplant is Tissue matching (HLA protein matching). Hence the best chance of a match is among close relatives. All tissue transplants are mandated to go through Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC) so that illegal trading and racketeering does not take place. Each state has it's own ZTCC with a tissue database.Donor Relative gives best chance of Transplant successFirst step is to find out if any one of your mothers family members are a tissue match and if they are, are they willing to donate one of their kidneys? A person is able to lead an absolutely normal life with one kidney. This is the simplest way to go about a kidney transplant.This first step is essential because if close relatives do not want to donate, then how can you expect a stranger to donate?Sometimes none of the close relatives are a tissue match. Then there two options:1. Swap TransplantIf a family member of your mother is a tissue match for another patient awaiting a kidney transplant and one that patient's relative is a tissue match for your mother, then basically you can swap the kidneys and both recipients will have a good chance of transplant success2. Waiting for organ donationYou will have to register in the ZTCC for your state. The registration has to be done through a registered Transplant center/Hospital in that state. The patient’s name is registered through hospital and the patients cannot get registered directly to the ZTCCExamples of ZTCCMaharastra ZTCC HomepageKarnataka ZCCK :: HomeThis is the form you are supposed to fill for registration in KarnatakaPage on www.zcck.inOnce registered you will be put on a waiting list and whenever a donor- Cadaver or brain dead or living donor whose tissue matches with your mother is available, you will be contacted regarding the same and immediate surgery will be recommended. This will be according to the waiting list and if your refuse when the tissue arrives, it will go to the next recipient on the waiting list. This way is the most difficult way to get a donor kidney.In Maharastra alone according to ZTCC HomepageAs on January 2015, 2776 patients waiting for kidney, 199 for liver [with repeated registration].Organ trade, Kidney Rackets and FraudI know it is desperate times for you but you cannot buy life by throwing money so I would suggest you not to go looking for illegal ways to procure the kidney.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"There are already many answers here asking about the ambiguity of smart being high IQ or high EQ. I enjoyed Steve Harris answer the most as I think He's hit the nail on the head. Robert Gluck comes in second in the way he describes the inability of not so smart people to keep it short-I'm no exception :-) I feel you need a good deal of both IQ and EQ but that might not be enough. One would be naive to believe person with low IQ and high EQ would succeed in this field (I had quite a few classmates/seniors/juniors in this category). I have sometimes seen people with very high IQ and low EQ ( I knew quite a few here as well) doing well but they make it easy on themselves and take up roles where they don't need have patient interaction. Radiology, pathology, anesthesia, etc.IQ makes you grasp things and EQ gets you to do the right things at the right time. Skills are necessary of course like in surgery. Some surgeons are gifted but some are not so much. Surgery is more about practice than actual intellect. Personally for my own surgery I would prefer a careful slow surgeon than a gifted fast one. In any case surgical skills are not the most important aspect about a doctor. There is more than this balance of smartness to make up a doctor. One needs motivation, humility, zeal, curiosity, leadership, enterprise and that ability to overcome disappointment in addition to being smart. One would argue this is not what smartness is about but I disagree. Judgment is key in the medical profession and taking a call is something we have to frequently do. We have to think on our feet, make the right diagnoses, judge whether certain interventions are necessary or whether to intervene at all, think about cost-benefit, counsel patients about different options, keep in mind the things that can go wrong, forewarn the patients about that and yet make peace with the fact that things can go wrong. All this in a short period of time (20 mins if you are lucky).High IQ and EQ will get you to do the right thing and in the right way but to succeed as a doctor you needHumility to understand that not everything is under your control and your approach may not always be best. That there is always something to learn. Humility to get to the same level as a patient and empathize. A god complex never helps. Humility to know one's own limitation and know when to stop.Zeal to try new innovation and technology. To be an early adopter rather than an also ran.Curiosity to follow something out of the ordinary and discover a new way to do things.Leadership to take ownership of your decisions and not blame others under you for the problems that happen.Enterprise to know how to present what you do in way that appeals to the patients you serve.Motivation to try again even after you failTo have judgment you need all of the above in addition to high IQ/EQ. I've known doctors with high IQ and EQ and yet fall short when it comes to the art of judgment.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"There are many many books which kept me awake all night but if I had to name just one book then it would be The Salamandra Glass by AW Mykel​​​​​http://www.goodreads.com/book/sh...I was 13 I think and it was summer holidays-1998-99I found his not so well known novel in the dusty corner of my circulating library. The three headed salamandra was what caught my eye. I borrowed it and started reading the moment I entered the house around mid afternoon. Many hours later when normal people go to bed (at 11 or so) I was still reading it. Now approaching midnight there came a crucial stage in that book when knowing how the protagonist travels across Europe was critical to the plot. So I opened up the Atlas and started studying the map in immense detail. I then opened up my Britannica encyclopedia and read about the world wars and medieval history. By the time I finished matching the details in the book to the real history and geography, it was 3 am. I continued to read and I finally finished the novel at 7am in the morning! (I remember the time because my mom was shocked to find me in the same position she saw me at night before she went to sleep and asked me ""what time is it?"". It is her favourite story of my reading habits)The novel was 600 odd pages long! The fastest I have ever read a single book.I still treasure that exhilarating experience which took me on a long journey from the 1600s to the world wars and then to the modern world and it was well rooted in facts and the geography was credible. I wouldn't mind taking this journey again.Sadly, I've have had a tough time finding that book since then. Apparently the publisher has stopped printing that book. It is a shame though that such a jewel of a book has not become immortal.I'll take a little liberty and also name some honourable mentions which also kept me awake many nights:The Godfather by Mario PuzoThe day of the Jackal by Fredrick ForsythKane and Abel by Jeffrey ArcherTo kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I can't say how anybody else should spend their holidays but I don't think the way a medical student spends his or her holidays should be very different from how a regular college student does. I can however give some suggestions based on what I did during my vacations between terms. We had about 2 weeks off every 6 months or so. I believe I spent my time very usefully.Read booksHere I do not mean academic books. Read something outside of textbooks. Read about politics, world affairs, biographies or even fiction. Anything that can hold your interest. If you want to be closer to medicine I would recommend you read books, articles and TED videos by some renouned Physicians and Surgeons like Atul Gawande, Siddarth Mukerjee, Abraham Varghese, etc.Some recommendations: 1. 5 rules of practicing medicine by Atul Gawande -Page on wordpress.com2. How do we heal medicine?3. A doctor's touch4. Better5. How Doctors Die6. What Should Medicine Do When It Can’t Save You?7. The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer  by Siddartha Mukerjee http://www.goodreads.com/book/sh...VolunteerThere are scores of jobs in the healthcare sector where there is adequate scope for volunteering. Blood Banks, Blood donation and health camps, hospitals, Hospices and Old age homes, etc. These short term jobs helps you understand the human side of medicine. I volunteered in my local blood bank to collect blood in the donation camps. I learnt how to put in an IV line though this way.TravelI was guilty of enjoying my medical school life a bit too much and almost every vacation we went to some different destination.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"My math teacher in high school once said:""Mathematics is an abstract form of of torture and those who enjoy that torture, enjoy mathematics.""I'm a weird kind of medical student who loved mathematics to bits in school. If someone said they hated mathematics in high school I would roll my eyes and think ""Are you serious? Why would you hate the one subject that makes sense?""I think it might have to do with my high school math teacher. She would challenge me enough and always know one more problem which I could not solve. She never followed syllabus and made us challenge ourselves with every lesson. Her tests were the hardest and less than half the class would manage to get pass grade. She was a strict disciplinarian and was not generous to a fault. That never intimidated me. At one point of time all I wanted to be was a mathematician.My parents, wrongly believing that I needed tutorials for mathematics sent me for extra classes to a local tutor. Within a few months I could solve more complex problems than that tutor could teach me. I became the defacto approachable tutor of that classroom. That scene still makes me smile.When my final exams came our examination paper only required us to solve 5 out of 8 sections in our paper but my preparation was so good I did all eight sections and still had half an hour to spare. Needless to to say I maxed the paper. My love for Mathematics may have spilled over for me to develop a liking for Physics in junior college. Physics scores eventually resulted in me getting through my medical entrance.I think I was lucky to have teachers such as the ones I had in school. I realize many are not as lucky. Mathematics needs a teacher who can show the beauty of torture that mathematics is.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I like pharmacists. They know their drugs and form an important cog in healthcare delivery. They may sometimes act as checks on medicine dispensation. Their roles are well defined and should be restricted to drug dispensation, research and development.That being said, making Pharmacists prescribe medicines is a bad idea. I sometimes get the impression that people like to trivialize doctor visits. They just think that a doctor sits in his clinic. He hears your ailments and writes certain drugs he has committed to his memory. There seems to be visible heartburn at this seemingly simple job and that the doctor gets paid for it. The truth is that people underestimate the value of a doctor-patient interaction. There is more to it than just listening to a given set of complaints and prescribing medicine. Diagnosis and treatment is an art that a doctor gets better at with more experience. That is what medical school and residency is for. The training is a lot different than what a pharmacy student undergoes. Just reading books is not going to make one a doctor.I mean no disrespect to pharmacists but diagnosing and taking responsibility for medicines prescribed is not in their job description and shouldn't be so. Everyone loves quick simple solutions to complex problems and things like these make amazing tea time conversations. It isn't so simple and in India it rarely is. When the boundaries become blurrier we are just one push away from dangerous territory.PS: A clarification: There is a difference between Pharmacist and a Phamacologist. A Pharmacist has an undergraduate degree in Pharmacy while a Pharmacologist has a medical undergraduate degree (MBBS) followed by a MD degree in Pharmacology. So the later are already licensed to prescribe medicines while the former are not. Thanks for the A2A",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I don't think neurosurgery has become more competitive than other specialties. It has remained the same or numerically speaking has become less competitive than the previous decades. I'm of course speaking of India where the number of residency slots itself is highly competitiveRaghuraj S. Hegde's answer to How do doctors in India go for post graduation? Do they sit at home and prepare or do they prepare along with working?The competition is enormous:As of today in India every year, there are (rough figures)4000 Govt college Residency slots6,000 Private college Residency slots2,000 Diploma slots (private and govt)and 150,000 Post-MBBS candidates writing PG entrance examinations.I don't want to rant about reservation here, But it is fair to mention that 49.5% of the government PG slots go to OBC/SC/ST. It does play a big role in how early you get a residency slot. For a general candidate the competition is manifold more. At least half of those Private College Residency slots are prohibitively expensive and some of the rest are obviously sold under the garb of entrance exams.So if you look at the above figures you can understand the ground realities in India. So a high demand residency like Neurosurgery is obviously in high demand.Another important factor is that the OP assumes that every doctor takes up a specialty based on how much much money he/she can make having the least stress. Some people love taking up more difficult endeavors because they are passionate about it. Some people revel in high stress scenarios.If Ben Carson had worried about lifestyle sacrifices and high stress in Neurosurgery we wouldn't be privileged to see him separate several Siamese Twins.Neurosurgery is a calling and many doctors take it up despite the sometimes inhuman working hours and stress involved. 2 of my classmates and several of my seniors and juniors are Neurosurgeons and I don't think they regret their choices. Some of them may in the future but then all people can't be the same.In India there are very few Integrated Neurosurgery Residency slots. Few that I am aware of  areNIMHANS - 5 year Mch Neurosurgery Residency (the most reputed in India)AIIMS- 6 year Integrated M Ch. Neurosurgery ResidencyDNB Neurosurgery Residency (6 year Integrated residency) in Top notch Private Insititutes  like Narayana Health City, Bangalore and Medanta Health City, Gurgaon etc.Why people would prefer an Integrated Neurorsurgery Residency instead of  a staggered Residency in General Surgery followed by Post Doctoral Residency in Neurosurgery is maybe because of the daunting numbers and effort required in gain a slot in highly competitive specialties like Neurosurgery. There are very few slots available for Mch Neurosurgery post MS General Surgery, so anyone getting a direct integrated residency would jump at the opportunity if he has decided that he will be a neurosurgeon.What it takes to be a Neurosurgeon?Many things including passion for the subject, aptitude, commitment, compassion, hand eye co-ordination,and the likes.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Thanks for the A2ARegarding your options.KMC Mangalore is an excellent medical college of International repute. There is no question of that. With regards to education your choice is a no brainer. I don't think even you have a doubt about it.The problem that you want answering is the financial aspect. Whether it is worth it?KMC MangaloreRs. 8 lakhs per year fees+ 1-2 lakhs/ yr for books/accomodation/food = Approximately 45 lakhs for MBBS alone.GMC YavatmalRs. 50,000/yr +1-2 lakhs/ yr for books/accomodation/food = Aproximately around 7 Lakhs for a 4 and 1/2 year course of MBBSThe unfortunate part is your MBBS is not going to be the end all. You would want to specialize. Residency is not a very simple affair.This is one of my answers that I would like you to readRaghuraj S. Hegde's answer to How do doctors in India go for post graduation? Do they sit at home and prepare or do they prepare along with working?The competition is enormous:As of today in India every year, there are (rough figures)4000 Govt college Residency slots6,000 Private college Residency slots2,000 Diploma slots (private and govt)and 150,000 Post-MBBS candidates writing PG entrance examinations.I'm not saying it is impossible to get a government PG seat of your choice when you finish MBBS. It is definitely possible. But do consider this if you cant land up with a government seat and get a merit seat at the same KMC, Manipal/Mangalore the present fees is 10Lakh/year for another 3 years excluding living expenses. Management seat 6 years down the line will be close to 2 crores.Suppose you want to do DM/M. ch, that again is another mountain and 3 more years.You haven't started earning yet.Hypothetically let us suppose you go to KMC Mangalore. Get an MD/MS in a government college or DNB, then get DM/DNB/Mch again a government funded seat, you still have the 45 Lakh deficit before you even start your career.You would never recover your financial investment by just working as a doctor with a monthly salary. Being a doctor in India is not that profitable unless you own a hospital or build one and make other doctors work for you. Even then its a 50/50 chance you would succeed. Building your practice takes time.Again some approximate figuresMost post MS/MD/DNB start at around Rs. 30-75k starting salary depending on the speciality and city of practice.(Exception to this is MD Radiology after which you can get an extremely high paying job- in the tune of 1.5- 2 Lakh/month straight out of residency)Post DM/Mch/ Fellowship/Super specialist DNB- Rs. 60,000- 2 lakhs starting salary again depending on speciality and place of practiceI want you to consider all these issues before deciding on what you want to do. If you don't consider it now 12 years later you might be worrying about where your next paycheck is coming from.So you say your mother is willing to  pay the fees. If it is a part of her savings that she is not looking for return in the long term and it doesn't matter if you can return this money she is investing on you then go for KMC, Mangalore without second thought. If she is taking a student loan to fund your studies which she expects you to pay back then it might be very difficult for you with just a doctor's job. If it is part of her savings which has been kept as an insurance for her old age and she has no other savings to back up on, choose wisely.The issues about GMC, Yavatmal that you mention are probably true. It is near the vidharbha region and is a really impoverished area of Maharashtra and not many doctors want to work there. That is reflected in the substandard teaching. The only advantage that you have here is that it is a government college with sufficient patient load. Staying motivated may be a problem in such an environment I agree. But it is not the end all of everything. Highly motivated people can overcome substandard teaching and infrastructure and become very capable doctors. Several of my friends who studied in  very substandard medical colleges are doing extremely well today because they never let their own standards drop despite the mediocrity around them. I don't see why you cannot do it. Choices in our lives are rarely easy but you have to take a call on it yourself. I understand your dilemma but I would prefer you would think this through before you embark on a lifetime of Medicine. Unfortunately it is not all about helping and saving people. Your own survival is important for you to serve and help other people.I'll give you my own break up of my MBBS (I started in 2002)I got into a private medical college in the free seat government categoryJSS Medical College, MysoreRs. 16,200/yr fees+ Rs. 1+ Lakh Living costs= around 6 Lakhs Plus another 2-3 lakhs living costs for 2 years for one year of internship then another year of PG preparation.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Disclaimer: I  had pursued MS Ophthalmology and had not written the DNB entrance exam during my pre-PG time.A few years back I would have told MS/MD is better than DNB for the simple reason that the selection process for DNB was highly suspect. You getting into a DNB program depended on the right kind of people you knew or on the mercy of the institute you were working as a medical officer. It wasn't at all fair. There was no credibility for the doctor getting in. Also pass percentage was extremely low...in ortho and radio it was less than 10% pass rate. the centers never bothered about results hence no academicsBut things have changed since 2010. There is an All India DNB entrance exam and a central counselling process for both primary and secondary DNB which now adds credibility to the course and now pass rates are approaching 100% in most centers as institutes realize only having slave labour won't cut it and they will have high attrition rates if they don't invest energy into academics and teaching.Also now with Supreme Court order removing that last strand of ambiguity saying DNB and MS/MD is equivalent I don't see why I should not recommend DNB. The biggest advantage of DNB is that they get to work in the best facilities, in the top institutes with large resources available and always on the cutting edge of medical care.So many of my friends and colleagues who have done DNB from big centres are doing extremely well sometimes much better than their MS/MD counterparts. With the dismal state of most medical colleges in India I see these top institutes having DNB leading the way forward in the near future. A lot of government and private medical colleges don't have good infrastructure and are staffed by retiring and retired professors. These people do not make good mentors as they are not interested in teaching the residents or making them competent surgically for the real world. Some colleges don't even give residents a chance to operate. The MCI teams which come to inspect the infrastructure are all corrupt and clear these colleges due to either political or financial clout. The MCI does not have a structured program for Residency (academic and surgical) so  the level of training is variable depending of the college and guide you land up with. As an example I did my Ophthalmology Residency from Regional Institute of Ophthalmology, Kolkata  in which I found excellent mentors and incredible surgical experience. I doubt any other medical college in India can come close to the number of surgeries a resident does in RIO- Kolkata. I was extremely lucky.  Contrast that to AMU, Aligarh or BHU, Varanasi. Supposedly both are central institutes with good funding and facilities but they both  have terrible residency programs with residents hardly performing 10 cataracts surgeries (if lucky) in 3 years of residency. Or contrast that to all private medical colleges in Karnataka where I hail from. Most of these residents would not have done a single cataract surgery by the end of their residency.I'm not saying it wont happen in DNB institutes but they have profits driving their infrastructure and having residents who won't leave them make economic sense to them. they will always try to keep the standards high.In conclusion I would say both are equivalent and of the same value when it comes to jobs. The center you do it is more important than the MD/MS/DNB label. Thanks for the A2A",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The witty patient!!Lot of our daily practice in our clinics would involve seeing patients,making quick diagnoses and discussing various treatment options. We do sometimes joke with our patients to make it a more comfortable environment but most of our work though intellectually stimulating is not so much humorous. One patient of mine impressed me with her quick wittedness.A lady came into my clinic with red eyes and red angry lower eyelids. It wasn't fitting into any particular diagnosis other than allergic dermatitis.So on repeated questioning she finally confessed that she arm twisted her dermatologist to prescribe her bimatoprost for getting long eyelashes.Bimatoprost is an anti glaucoma drug whose side effect is long eyelashes. So drug companies and cosmetologists have started using this side effect as a cosmetic tool.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"It is a very good idea and I have often thought about such a possibility.The problem with the healthcare sector in India is that it is highly disorganized and the doctor-patient experience is compromised. On many occasions the patients with a specific complaint do not land up at the right places or doctors. They are often treated sub-optimally and sometimes plain wrongly. The premium on expert physicians and surgeons are not appreciated by both patients and in some cases even hospitals. Another problem is the problem of trust. Whenever people from other Indian cities come to  metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, etc for treatment, they are misled by illegal, uneducated touts and directed to select hospitals thereby conning them into taking sub-standard treatment. Touts in Delhi prey on desperate patients to provide quick 'services'Touts rip off patients coming to hospitals for cheaper care | Bangalore NYOOOZI was made aware of this when I saw many Bangladeshi patients come to Singapore for treatment when I was working there. Medical and Surgical costs can be up to 10 times higher in Singapore compared to India. This intrigued me a lot because Kolkata is an overnight train ride away from Dhaka. All the medical services they come to Singapore are available in Kolkata.  I finally discussed this issue with a Bangladeshi Doctor working in Singapore. He said the biggest problems are trust and standards. When you land in India, you never know whether you are going to an excellent hospital or a terrible hospital. Looks can be deceiving even in big Indian hospitals. The difference in medical care and standards can vary from top-notch medical facilities and doctors to almost quackery-level care. It all depends on the ""agents"" they hire to wade through the quagmire of the disorganized healthcare. This is the same problem that exists for Indians trying to get the correct treatment in India.Contrast this to Singapore, they can walk into any hospital in Singapore and get almost the same level of care and expertise in every hospital. Despite the high costs, the costs are predictable and accounted for. So patients prefer excellent standards, competent doctors, consistency and transparency in medical care than just low cost of care.Some Indian websites have tried to overcome these challenges like practo.com  but  haven't really made a difference.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Ocular Onchocerciasis (River blindness; Robles Disease) is majorly (~90%) seen in sub-saharan African continent. It is also seen in the Mediterranean region and the Central Americas.According to WHO estimates it is the second leading cause of infectious blindness. Nearly 1 million infected people are visually impaired or blind. Ocular Oncoceriasis is also part of the WHO Vision 2020 priority program.Oncocerciasis is caused by Onchocerca volvulus - a nematode from the same family of the filarial parasite. ​ImageSource: http://web.stanford.edu/group/pa...It is transmitted from the bite of the vector Black fly (Simulium exiguum). ​Image Source: Black Flies (“Buffalo Gnats”)Clinically there are two types of Ocular blindness1. Direct eye entry- Here the sandfly bites near the eye and the micro-filariae enters eye directly from the surface of the eye - cornea, sclera, iris and produces severe inflammatory reaction causing Punctate keratitis, Sclerosing Keratitis, Iridocyclitis and anterior uvietis. This is the more severe type causing severe blinding illness2. Indirect eye entry- Microfilariae enter the eye through the blood supply to the eye. The micro-filariae enter the retina and cause Chorioretinitis, vascular compromise and late optic atrophy. Epidemiologically two types Ocular blindness are described1. Savannah Type- Severe form2. Rainforest Type- Less severe formRecent studies have found that that, like many other filarial parasites, O. volvulus shares an endosymbiotic relationship Bacterium Wolbachia. The severity of the inflammation is proposed to be related to the strength of colonization of the endosymbionts. Products of these endosymbionts which are released on the death of the parasite, have been theorized in the pathogenesis of ocular onchocerciasisThere appears to be cross-reactivity between the Onchocerca antigen Ov39 and the retinal antigen hr44, which can explain the chorioretinitis seen in few individuals even after  appropriate treatment and blood showing decreased microfilariae count.Some extra related reading:Short version of the life cycle of O. VovulusAdult worm gives birth to hundreds of micro-filariae (microscopic larvae) everyday in infected persons and released into blood --> These reach the black fly's gut from biting and consuming an infected person's blood-->It matures into 2nd stage of larva in the gut and in 7 days it reaches the saliva of the fly--> further transmitted to other persons by biting --> further maturation  into adult worms happen in subcutaneous tissue of the body--> cycle continues.Adult worms rarely cause symptoms because it forms a protective capsule around it in the subcutuaneous tissue. When it dies there is severe anaphyllactic allergic reaction. Adult worms are known to live at least a decade producing millions of micro-filariae each in it's lifetime.Some more interesting reading about Ivermectin - a wonder drug in the treatment of River blindness. Here is the drug discovery story:THE DRUG DISCOVERY STORYIn 1975, workers at Merck laboratories were screening compounds for therapeutic effects with the strategy of developing them for veterinary use. They received 54 samples from the Kitsato Institute in Japan including some soil samples obtained from a Japanese golf course, one of which contained a factor with significant antiparasitic effects, which they called Avermectin. The structure of the compound was of a macrocylclic lactone, which is naturally produced in soil by Streptomyces avermitilis. This structure was further modified by reducing a single double bond to decrease its toxicity in animal studies and this new compound was called Ivermectin and marketed under the name Mectizan. While studying the response of equine Onchocerca cervicalis to this compound, Dr. William Campbell, leader of the Merck team and the scientist responsible for the development of thiabendazole, recognized the properties ivermectin possessed suggested its utility against River Blindess caused by the human parasite Onchocerca volvulus. With the encouragement of P. Roy Vaeglos, M.D. president of the Merck Research Laboratories, the company began seriously to consider the potential use of ivermectin in humans.References:World Health Organization.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I think in your case there has been a miscommunication from doctor to patient. Avoiding rigourous exercise and lifting heavy weights is not a recommendation at all.Injury to the head or directly to the eye can in a few cases result in a retinal detachment, particularly in a highly myopic (nearsighted) person. High myopes have eyes that have grown  longer than usual. The tissues inside the eye, such as the retina, are stretched tighter and may have thin peripheral areas which are prone to tears or holes that can progress to a retinal detachment.  Well that's the theory.Lets see some actual numbers:The incidence of retinal detachment during one's lifetime for an otherwise non- high-myopic eye is approximately 1 in 20,000 people. The risk in a highly myopic person is elevated by approximately 10 times, (still the number is well below 0.5%). Being High myopic is a risk factor for retinal detachment. Exercise is important to have a healthy lifestyle. Myopia is no excuse to not exercise. Rigorous exercise and even weight training are alright from the eye point of view. Exercises or sports to be avoided for highly myopic individuals would be those involving high risk of direct head or eye trauma such as boxing, karate, kick boxing, Muay Thai. Rugby, etc. You get the drift. Some forms of Yoga such as ""Sirhasana"" are known to cause Glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure) in some people (not necessarily in Myopes)In summary almost any form of exercise could be considered safe from an eye point of view as long as proper eye protection is observed.Thanks for the A2A Keshav Samrat Modi",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"What is Retinoblastoma?Retinoblastoma is a cancer of the eye. The cancer starts in the retina — the light sensing part of the eyeball on the inside of your eye. ​​Retinoblastoma Labeled DiagramRetinoblastoma is usually a cancer of young children, but in rare cases even adults can suffer from this cancer. It is the most common eye cancer of childhood. Incidence may vary from 1/18,000 births in developed nations to 1/12,000 births in developing nations.It can be heritable as well as non-heritable. The non-heritable type is the most common type accounting to about 90-93% of all retinoblastomas.Reasons for high success rate are manyGenetic basis of the tumour being identifiedEarly diagnosis of the tumourMultiple treatment optionsCutting edge basic and clinical researchGenetic basisAt the beginning of the 20th century the survival rate of children with Retinoblastoma was less than 17%. After modest success for many decades the discovery of the Rb1 gene mutation (1986) was game changing.More than 70 years ago, it was recognized that retinoblastoma sometimes has a genetic basis and that the pattern (when genetic) is classic Mendelian autosomal dominant. It was not until Alfred Knudson proposed his two-hit hypothesis and the subsequent molecular confirmation of his calculation that it was recognized that this autosomal-dominant pattern is caused by the loss of a normally occurring gene that is now referred to as the RB1. Although it was originally thought to be of importance only in retinal cancers, it is now recognized that loss of the normal RB1 gene is an important step in cancer development in most adult nonocular cancers. Early DignosisEarly detection of Retinoblastoma is the key. Leukocoria- which translates to white pupil- in other words whitish appearance from the centre of the eye is the most important sign of Retinoblastoma, which brings it to the attention of the parents to seek help.​​Medscape: Medscape AccessThere are other signs too but Leucocoria  is the most common sign. This early sign and hence early diagnosis is also responsible for high cure rates seen in Retinoblastoma.Treatment optionsThe biggest advantage in the treatment of Retinoblastoma is that it is responsive to mutiple options of treatment unlike other tumours.The characteristics of the tumour isExtremely chemosensitive and hence it has high response to chemotherapyRadiosensitive, so Radiotherapy is an option even when the tumour has spread outside the eyeball.It is amenable various local therapy like Laser therapy, thermal therapy, cryotherapy and plaque brachytherapy. This is possible because we can visualize the tumour using an ophthalmoscope.When only one eye is involved, Surgery -Enucleation can sometimes give permanent cure from the cancer.Pioneering researchAs it stands today, in the best centers in the world for Retinoblastoma care, the success rates are staggering- 95% Life salvage90% Eye salvage85% Vision salvageThis is staggerring because just 50 years ago, the rates of survival in children with retinoblastoma was less than 30% even in the best centers.All this was possible due to the pioneering research of Ocular Pathologist, Dr. Lorenz Zimmerman and 3 generations of his family. His own son, Larry and grand-daughter, Perry suffered from Retinoblastoma and survived due to research done by his family members. His daughter Dr. Mary Louise Collins wrote an editorial in JAMA Ophthalmology journal in May 2014. There she writes:The Zimmerman family had a number of “firsts” in the field of retinoblastoma, including publications in the field, intracarotid chemotherapy and bilateral external beam radiotherapy to treat Larry’s retinoblastoma, Zimmerman’s nomenclature for trilateral retinoblastoma, Zimmerman grandchildren born following PGD to avoid the RB1 gene, and treatment of Perry’s pineal tumor with intrathecal chemotherapy. The many ironies include my father’s interest and work in the field of retinoblastoma with subsequent development of bilateral retinoblastoma in his son and granddaughter, the latter later developingthe extremely rare trilateral retinoblastoma following work by her uncle and grandfather to name this tumor. Through this journey of compiling our family’s contributions in the field of retinoblastoma, it has become clear to me that my father’s passion for his work was driven not only by his love of science, medicine, and pathology but also by his personal challenges in the field.Zimmerman Family StoryIt would be a mistake not to mention the contributions of stalwarts in the field of Retinoblastoma- Drs. Algernon Reese, Robert Ellsworth , Carl Kupfer (USA), Henry Stallard (UK), Gerd Meyer-Schwickerath (Germany)- whose decades worth of dedicated research has resulted in our present scenario.The impressive and consistent success we see today is due to the treatment protocols designed by some present day practicing doctors- Drs. David Abramson, Jerry and Carol Shields (USA), Francis Munier and Sheilds' fellows-Dr. Arun Singh (USA) and Dr. Santosh Honavar (India). Of course there are many, many other ocular oncologists who have contributed to the field in many small parts.Incidentally, a part of my fellowship training was under Dr. Santosh Honavar, so I consider myself to be part of the same pedigree of Ocular oncologists.Today Retinoblastoma is treated using a team based approach. The team consists of an Ocular Oncologist, Pediatric Oncologist, Radiation Oncologist, Pathologist, Interventional radiologist and an Ocularist. This approach too has resulted in better care for children with retinoblastoma.I've written about Retinoblastoma talking more about Dr. Zimmerman family story and my personal experience in my medical blogHope and Heartbreak: The two sides of Retinoblastoma.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Keratoconus is a condition if detected early can be treated well and patients can maintain normal vision with certain techniques. It is certainly not considered dangerous today. Keratoconus is gradual thinning of the cornea. Why it happens is still not clear and the present understanding is that it is due a combination of factors including hereditary, environment, allergy and even excessive eye rubbing.In your case since C3R was done in time you are at very low risk of progression. C3R is a revolutionary treatment that is available today which halts the progression of Keratoconus. Once stability is achieved one may have the option of using RGP contact lenses or Scleral contact lenses. With these lenses a keratoconic patient can see as well as a normal person.Sometimes by using ICL in a stable keratoconic patient complete freedom from glasses and contact lenses may be achieved.If thinning is severe there are surgeries like keratoplasties which have excellent prognosis. So do not lose hope.Get yourself checked regularly from a cornea specialist and having 6monthly corneal topography initially and yearly after 2 years.Good luck. Be glad that Keratoconus lends itself to good treatment. There are many eye conditions that do not even have treatment.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"It is pure Physics or rather pure Optics at play here. It is called the Pinhole effectWhen a ray of light passes through the center of any lens it is not refracted. So what you are essentially doing by the finger and thumb is create a pin-hole to make only the rays that come straight to reach the retina of your eye. ​Image source: Why Do I See Better When I Squint?As you can see in the figure by using the pin hole, only the straight light rays are allowed to enter and these straight rays pass through the center of the eye's crystalline lens. There is a smaller circle of blur in the retina, so you get a sharper image with less noiseA pinhole is in fact used by Ophthalmologists, Optometrists and Orthoptists to test if visual acuity can be improved with prescription glasses. The instrument used is called the Pinhole- occluder. Visual Acuity does not improve with pinhole if the decrease in vision is due to some other cause like retina or optic nerve disease.The Pupil also serves as a sort of a pinhole camera, dilating and contracting to allow more or less light into the eye to see better. You can actually compare this to the aperture of your point and shoot camera!​Image Source: Pupils Respond To More Than LightSome companies have used the pinhole effect to offer products such as these:​Image Source: JournalFor the life of me, it really beats me why someone would want to wear something like that other than to prove that one can. Personally, I would prefer the regular plain vanilla prescription glasses to this contraption which reduces your field of vision.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Edit1: Disclaimer:After I wrote this answer I got several hostile and some outright hate messages. I request you not to misunderstand my intentions. I'm neither a Palestinian sympathizer not a Jew-hater as these people might think. I hope the hate mail stops.Edit2: Some in the comments have pointed out some factual errors in my account. I do not wish to change my answer for one simple reason that it was a version of events I heard from an actual Palestinian. The Israeli versions can be seen from the majority of the answers/comments to this question. It is certainly not in short supply. I encourage you to read the comments and make up your own mind.My answer below:I wrote a blog a couple of years ago when I met a Palestinian doctor who was training in the same hospital I was in. This is not a first person account of life in Palestine but a second person account. The blog post is as follows:“When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in, he has no choice but to become an outlaw.” ― Nelson Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom: Autobiography of Nelson Mandela We often believe that the information that reaches us is always the right information. why wouldn't we? we are not living in China where information is censored by the government nor is there any dearth of information with the world wide web which has largely been free of any restrictions till now! But recently I understood the perils of listening only to one side of the story for too long. Over time that one side of the story is perceived as truth. Last month I was working in a hospital which has international fellows coming in from different countries to train in specific disciplines and then go back to their countries to use that training. I had the good fortune to meet one such fellow from Palestine who was working in the same department I was. We shared a common love for the subspecialty we were working in and over discussions of ophthalmology we also discussed a whole lot of international politics too. The information junkie that I am I was only too happy to know about stories I would probably never ever hear about. The stories the international media feeds us or even the Indian media feeds us is that Palestinians are a group of people governed by terrorists and that Israelis are always the victims of Palestinian intolerance. We’ve been fed these pro- Israeli stories so many times that we believe it as fact. But the true picture is not so straightforward. I do not want to go into the whole history of Israel- Palestinian conflict which is extensive and most of which is available on the internet. I want to talk about stereotypes and misconceptions created by international media. It’s interesting to note that Israel is a country that was formed only in 1948 on Palestinian land and now ironically it is the state of Palestine that is not recognized by the UN. The British who  ruled over the Palestine area could not handle local tensions between Arabs and Jews so after the world war II out of a sense of compensation for the Holocaust granted the formation of the state of Israel.This in turn resulted in the large immigration of Jews into the Palestine area hence making it a Jewish majority. The Israelis have been fighting the Arab countries ever since and the conflict with Palestinians have continued to this day while Israelis have peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan. As an impressionable teenager I read with tears in my eyes the story that Anne Frank was narrating so calmly in her autobiography. The Holocaust was a truly horrific episode in Jewish history. The 1972 massacre of the Olympic athletes was tragic as well (Steven Spielberg made the movie ‘Munich’ from this episode, who incidentally was the director of the Holocaust movie ‘Schindler’s List’). I had concluded after reading so extensively about Jews, about the tortures and concentration camps during the Nazi regime that Jews were the most oppressed race in the world and that anyone who are against Jews are inhuman by default. But i failed to realize until I met this Palestinian doctor, how instances of injustice to the Jews have been documented over the years in print, broadcasting and movies but the Palestinian stories are somehow elusive to all of us. I’m not belittling the Holocaust nor am I endorsing the terrorist attacks on Jews. I want to shed some light on the other side of this Israel-Palestine conflict. You would be surprised to know (I was too) that Palestinian territories are landlocked territories surrounded by Israel and people from these areas are not allowed to go towards the sea by Israeli authorities (though it is only 40km from their border) and all the Palestinian borders are controlled by Israel including its borders with Egypt and Jordan. There are no airports in Palestine and anybody wanting to leave the country will have to go through Israeli airports for which you would need loads of paperwork and permission. There are two Palestinian territories, the Gaza strip and the West bank but these are separated by Israel and hence have two different governments with no common governing mandate and ruled by different political outfits. A Palestinian from one territory is not allowed easy access to the other territory hence both these territories are mutually exclusive and independent of each other. Despite being highly educated there are limited employment opportunities in Palestine hence many Palestinians choose to live and work in Israel. Israel is a developed country while Palestine is barely there due to restriction of Palestinian border trade by Israel. Palestinians who chose to live in Israel are forbidden to marry, have a family or even ever visit Palestine again. Even this Palestinian doctor i met works in Israel in a Christian hospital. He lives near the border with his family and makes the daily to and fro journey from Palestine to Israel just to earn his livelihood. His wife too does the same to work in some telecom company in Israel. All these journeys and checks to have the right to have a family!!! But the most touching story I heard from him was this. His elder sister married and emigrated to Australia with her In-laws in 1987.Since 1987 she has never been able to visit Palestine again. So she decided to visit her country of origin with her two kids last year. After landing at the Israeli airport she was stopped at the border check point. She and her kids were Australian citizens with Aussie passports. The Israeli authorities told her that her sons had the right to pass the border but since she had been a Palestinian before 1987 she would have to produce a Palestinian ID to do the same. His sister and her kids had to return home without visiting anyone from their family. My Palestinian friend has not seen his own sister for the last 25 yrs!!! These stories are not exceptions but these are commonplace instances in that region. This is like a goldfish living in a fishbowl…. despite seeing everything the goldfish can never go out of the bowl nor can it hope any other goldfish to give it company. Its life is governed by the rules of whoever feeds the goldfish and not by what the goldfish wants. If you make them live like goldfish is it any surprise that they retaliate in a violent way? Humans were not meant to be in a fish bowl nor are they goldfishes. When he spoke about the whole situation there was no anger in his voice, only sadness.Sadness over all the Jewish friends he has lost over the years, over the misconceptions that dominate all over the world about Palestinians, about all the family members he can never see and how their freedom to live life the way they want it is not there but no one knows or cares about it outside their country. His words at the end were very profound, “No Palestinian ever killed a Jew in the Holocaust yet today it is we Palestinians who are paying the price for it.”",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The mind can play strange tricks on you. This phenomena is quite interesting and something I read extensively during my residency. So this answer is based on my notes on the same. Both phenomena is essentially due to faulty wiring- in this case, nerves- Inflammation of the nerves-Optic Neuritis. Both phenomena is usually but not exclusively seen in Optic neuritis due to Multiple Sclerosis.The Pulfrich effect first described by Carl Pulfrich in 1922 is a complex visual effect wherein the lateral motion of an object in the field of view is interpreted by the brain as having a depth component, due to a relative difference in signal timings between the two eyes.It can be artificially induced in normal eyes using a neutral filter in one eye. This has been used to produce cheap 3D vision. This 3D technique was very popular in the 1980s when TV and movie producers used this.. Unfortunately the technique was not perfect so went into disuse when people came up with a better idea.The Pulfrich phenomenon also occurs in certain eye pathology where one eye has a more dull view than the other. Most commonly seen in Optic neuritis. It can also been seen in cataract and some rod cone dystrophies.The Pulfrich experimental model consists of a pendulum swinging perpendicular the line of sight. A neutral density filter is placed in one eye (left eye in the picture below)​Image source: The Amateur ScientistThe the pendulum would appear to be revolving clockwise, appearing closer as it swings toward the left and farther as it swings toward the right. This is the effective 3D vision that is achieved. In some cases of optic neuritis this phenomenon happens without the need for a neutral density filter.Uhthoff's phenomenon was first observed by Wilhelm Uhthoff in 1890 as a temporary worsening of vision with exercise in patients with optic neuritis. Research done later showed that it is seen in optic neuritis (due to multiple sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating conditions) when the body gets overheated from exercise or anything that raises body temperature like fever, hot baths and even warm weather. With increase in body temperature nerve conduction is probably slowed or blocked down. This phenomenon may also be generalized to the whole body where in there is worsening of neurological symptoms on increase in body temperature and decrease of neurological symptoms on reduction to normal body temperature.References:1.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Let me state outright that big hospitals do have unethical ways of making money. I'll get back to how again.The main question from what I see in this question and its details is, whether it is possible for hospitals to admit a dead patient and make money out of it? (This is incidentally what my wife asked me after seeing the movie)For that I would say NO. The movie scene is a gross misrepresentation of actual facts. It is not as simple as how it is shown in the movie to prove a dead man as alive and hospitals wouldn't risk it. The risk of getting caught does not make business sense to them. All the hospitals worry about is how to maximize profits from already revenue generating sectors. An emergency is always a loss making entity in every hospital all over the world.Again as pointed out by another answer here it is the hospital and not necessarily the doctors who indulge in non-ethical means to increase revenue. It is very important for people to understand the difference.I'm not denying or defending any corrupt doctor or establishment. Corruption is an affliction of our society and it transcends all sectors and it follows the rule of ""path of least resistance"". Whenever there is a gap or loophole in the system there are always people ready to take advantage of it. What one fails to understand is that doctors and all people working in the health sector are essentially human and come from the same society that we all live in. Expecting medical professionals (note I did not just say doctors) to be unscrupulous is a bit naive while every other sector in India indulge in corrupt practices. Medical professionals are a reflection of the society they live in. We cannot improve the medical profession without removing corruption from our society.As for big corporate hospitals. The government has very few regulations regarding hospitals and hospitals will prefer it that way. Hospitals and labs now have something called accreditation. NABH for hospitals and NABL for labs. This a measure of standardization of health sector in India. Insurance companies insist on NABH and NABL certification to reimburse claims from hospitals and labs. So this has given rise to large scale corruption in the accreditation business. Now there are ""Consultants"" who will guarantee accreditation and charge hefty sums to the hospital while they bribe various officials. See how it works.  Read about who run these government agencies.http://www.nabh.co/Hospitals are run as corporate entities and it is for profit. They do not pretend to treat patients for charity. Their aim is to maximize profits anyway they can. It is often seen that they pressurize their doctors and other health professionals to increase billing or their jobs are in line. People do succumb to such pressures and propagate this unhealthy culture. They also have to pay their bills. The medical professionals may not directly benefit from the actions enforced by the hospitals.Also another reason is that people do not want to directly pay a good fee to a doctor instead they prefer to pay indirectly through scans and lab investigations. Again a deficiency of the society and there will be people who will take advantage of it. People think diagnosing and treating does not look like a big deal. In fact it is highly skilled work which needs years of study, knowledge and experience. Another reason why this might seem apparent is that people land up in big hospitals for even the smallest ailments which could be taken care of by the friendly neighborhood family physician. When hospitals don't do any investigations they are no good for the money you pay. If they do investigations they are looting you. Spot the hypocrisy here. Do not go to hospitals for a common cold, allergies and headache. Find a reliable Family physician and go to him first (this tribe is dwindling at an alarming pace in India).The bottom line is the holes in the system needs to be plugged instead of going after individuals. The kind of vigilante justice shown in the ""Gabbar"" movie sends the wrong message to the public- Trial by public shown to be condoned by the society. You really do not want to go that way. Please look at yourselves before pointing fingers and do watch your back. Somebody is pointing a finger at you.Edit 1:Probably this blog from an Indian doctor might give you a different perspective to this answer.http://www.dailyrounds.org/blog/...",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"This has been in the works for a long time. Though it may appear a novel concept, practicing Ophthalmologists know from their experience with other types of lasers used for Glaucoma Managament that Irises lose colour on application of laser.This iris colour changing laser involves using low energy laser beams over the iris which destroys the melanocytes (cells containing melanin) in the iris thereby changing the reflectivity of the iris body. It may appear blue, gray or violet in about 2 weeks after surgery. No surgery is 100% risk-free, however elegant the concept looks.What do I think? I'm not happy enough with the procedure to get it done on my eyes. If I'm not mistaken the company that is producing these machines are still running phase three clinical trials on humans. They would follow up for about a year at most till the USFDA gives them a go ahead to commercialize the machine. What happens after that? What I would be more interested in is in the long term effects of such a procedure. 5 year follow up and 10 year follow up, etc.These kind of procedures find early adopters in countries which do not have stringent rules for commercial use. The companies market it as a commercial product-even with phrases like ""100% safe"" and ""no adverse effects"".When a part of the iris tissue is destroyed-however small- there is always some form of risk- uveitis, pigmentary glaucoma, reactivation of viral infections, excessive destruction of iris causing iatrogenic colobomas. I wouldn't recommend it to my patients yet!Why do Ophthalmologists do it?Whenever a new technology comes in there are always some pioneer doctors who are willing to adopt it and bring about a change in patient care. That is how innovation in medical care is brought about. In the same breath there are patients who are willing to use new technology even when all safety questions have not been addressed. So we need the mavericks on both sides of the table to bring about innovation.Cost of new innovationAdoption of new technology is not without risks. The pioneer doctors run the risk of getting isolated from the physician community when things don't work or worse, patients have severe irreparable damage. Maverick patients run the risk of a damage they didn't sign up for. What is the right time to adopt new technology or innovation?Classical example of a pioneering procedure gone wrong is Radial Keratotomy (RK). (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...). It was developed in 1974, by Fyodorov, a Russian ophthalmologist. This procedure had very early adopters in India and was done by the thousands by some Indian Ophthalmologists on patients without both-patients and doctors- knowing the long term results of such procedures. Today when I see a patient who has got an RK in the 1980s, it is a Refractive nightmare not only for me but also for my Refractive surgery colleagues. The complications of RK are unacceptable by today's standards.On the other hand pioneers of LASIK got by just fine and have created a hugely successful Refractive surgery industry. Today even a conservative surgeon like me who waits for long term results before recommending procedures would tell you to go ahead with LASIK if you want to. The safety of Refractive surgery and selection of patients for such procedures have been well established.Priorities change if there are serious medical indications for trying out new innovations and technology without long term results. A great example of that would be direct intra-arterial (ophthalmic artery) chemotherapy for unilateral Retinoblastoma pioneered by the work of DH Abramson et. al (2006, USA) and replicated successfully in multiple patients by Shields et. al (2014, USA)Intra-arterial Chemotherapy for RetinoblastomaPage on eyecancer.comIntra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma in 70 eyes: outcomes based on the international classification of retinoblastoma.Are there huge risks in intra-arterial chemotherapy? Yes surely. Why do we do it?The alternatives are not very rosy either. So we have to take increased risks so that we are able to save more lives. Intra-arterial chemotherapy has been an incredible innovation in the treatment of Retinoblastoma.The bottom lineI wouldn't recommend taking extra risks for what is essentially a cosmetic procedure- the only benefit is that you can change the colour of your eyes, which you can with coloured contact lenses and have essentially the same effect.Thanks for the A2A James Pan",high,high,high,low,low

Celebrities are good at what they do viz acting, singing, making movies, playing cricket or sometimes their only talent is being famous (think KRK).

I'm hardly interested in what a convict thinks of another convict.Just how informed they are about the world around them is revealed in the following post. ​​​Seeing this kind of reaction from them, I would prefer they don't react at all.Dr. Kalam was a simple man with no intentions of being famous.He underwent his cataract surgery in Aravind Eye Hospital, Madurai as a free patient standing in a line with other poor patients when any top-notch hospital in the country would have done his surgery for free publicity.

He was not close pals with any of the celebrities you would have expected to react. Why would they specially have the responsibility to react on his demise?

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Well it is because of Public support. One has to understand that government spending is not dependent on scientific proof or evidence based science. Their spending is based on politicians' beliefs and what the common people want.Yedurappa, former Karnataka CM when he became CM spent crores on pujas when the state was suffering from drought.Faced with drought, Karnataka sets aside Rs 17 crore for prayers and yagnasSo how is that justified either? But people have no issues with this totally wrong behavior when clearly as a country we are short of funds.What Astrologers ForetellNo Homeopathic medicine has passed the double blind test and it is unlikely the homeopaths would want to subject it to that. The homeopathic community has rejected even the double blind randomized control trials as a way to find effectiveness of a drug. The simple reason being that they cannot prove that it works.Homeopathy is bunk, study saysNo evidence homeopathy is any better than a placebo, major Australian study saysIt is unlikely to convince the skeptics that it doesn't work because they will come back and say it worked for them. Everyone loves a miracle cure:​​​​​Even if that means day dreaming. I can't give you exact figures but a vast majority of the population believe that Homeopathy and Ayurveda work. Scientific evidence means zilch to these people. Anecdotal evidence is paramount to them and nothing else matters.Even in US, 4 million people take homeopathic medicine despite the fact that a lion's share of medical research comes from the US.Indian government supports Homeopathy and also Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani and Siddha- collectively known as AYUSH because it is a huge money spinner  and since they are short of medical doctors- to fool gullible people to believe that they are actually getting treatment. If the government bans any of the AYUSH systems-sparing Yoga of course the government will instantly become unpopular and lose the next election.The success of  Homeopathic clinics (there are plenty) which promise to cure people of asthma, diabetes, hypertention, heart disease, cancer etc is mostly due to the continued patronage of the government to this pesudo-science. Unless common people can change their mindsets this expenditure will never go. Thanks for the A2A Prashant Saxena",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"This is an answer modified from the answer I wrote for another question.I have an issue with the fact that a single exam is used to assess one's ability to become a doctor in India. One not only has to study but also has to battle finances, reservations and discouraging people throughout the study period. It is really unfair that one's career is stuck at a bottle neck called entrance exam. That said, not many things are fair in this world. I got through this bottleneck but I don't think I was any better than the rest of the people writing the exam. Maybe I was luckier and maybe I was hungrier than the rest I can never say. You can read my answer to the following question and gauge that I was really a plain Jane of the medical profession.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Can an average medical student get a clinical pg seat in government colleges?There is often the misconception that successful people never see failure. Often times we observe that some people have everything work out for them and everything falls in place. But most successful people are something like this duck below​I'm sure you went into your 2nd and 3rd attempts on your PG entrance already losing your battle in the mind. It becomes a downward spiral after that.Most successful people will never tell you this: ""How hard I work to get what I want""I know of a lot of people who work hard but don't do well in the exam. Outside the exam scenario you ask them any question and they have the answer. Its just that they go into the exam thinking they've already lost the game and that is what is the most important. I'm sure all the people who keep writing exam after exam year after year suffer from this syndrome. Again this is highly unfair but that is how it is.When you are pushed against the wall you get the most private moment in your life. You for the first time get to introspect on your life and mull on your priorities. I feel that one year I spent studying for my entrance absolutely changed the way I approached life. I realized that I would never let an exam define my worth and that lesson was to hold me good stead in all the exams I took.One has to understand that getting a PG seat is not the end all of everything. Once you get into residency, you just start on the next challenge before you. Hence just because you did not get a PG seat that does not mean the end of the road. There are so many career choices one has. It is important to prioritize what you want and how you will use your opportunities .If you are adamant that you cannot see yourself as anything but a doctor treating patients be willing to put in the hours and also never to go into any exam thinking there will be another exam after this. Every exam you write has to be written as the last entrance exam you will ever write.But then if you confront yourself and ask yourself ""Is that really what I want?"" you might get an answer you might be dreading but it maybe the answer you should be listening to.One doctor gave me this advice and I think it changed the way I used to think:""Don't wallow in self-pity because frankly no one except your parents cares about you. If you want to be a doctor who matters you can't be mediocre. The world belongs to  people who strive for excellence. If you are striving for anything less then you are wasting your time.""It sounds a little harsh now but it was something I needed to hear. Before this I used to crib that I'm stuck here after MBBS and blaming everyone from my parents to all of my friends for my condition. Once I changed my attitude everything changed. Positive attitude makes up for a lot of bad luck and misfortune.Last but not the least is that you should find wonder in the things that you study in medicine or you will never appreciate it enough to want it as badly",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"If your research paper is good most high impact journals won't charge you to publish. But of course for high impact journals like Nature, NEJM, Lancet- it is difficult to convince their peer review process to consider your paper worth publishing. It has to be a truly revolutionary paper.Even mid level respected journals won't charge you to publish except when you have colour illustrations/photographs and it is absolutely essential for it to be in colour. Usually some journals give a first author 1 colour page free of cost per year. Some offer you the option of making your article open access by paying a fee. This fee can range between US$100-$3000. In many universities in the developed world this fee may be paid by the university research fund. Research funding is almost non-existent in India so I don't think anyone will have luck with that. So if you don't pay the fee, your article will be published but with limited access online.However there is a new type of publishing research papers. PLOS journals and PLOS one in particular.https://www.plos.org/https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/...They believe in taking payment from the authors to make the research open access to everyone. It reaches more people than if it were not open access. This in turn makes the journals have high impact factor. Their publishing philosophy is drastically different from many of the older publishing groups. They have a very low threshold for acceptance and almost everything gets accepted if found genuine, in the correct formatting and if the authors are willing to pay. This ""publish everything"" philosophy may not always give rise to high quality papers and the peer review process is rather loosely applied. Personally I would take a paper in PLOSone less seriously than if it were published in NEJM. Some people think otherwise though. It gets their work recognized and they become a published author in the scientific world. I do however admit that it is a struggle with the complicated and sometimes biased peer review system in some reputed journals where emphasis is not on research quality but from who it comes from. A lot of good research from Indian scientists/clinician scientists get skeptical peer reviews and outright rejections. You then get to see a similar research paper in 6 months time published without hassles from a western author. To be fair, Indian wannabe authors are also masters in manipulating data and analysis so their skepticism is somewhat understandable. The bias though is disproportionate to the fake paper submissions. I also suspect that the Western authors get away with it much easier than an Indian or Chinese though I'm sure they would officially deny it.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I really wouldn't be able to answer this question until I was in residency. Yes it was pretty late in the road to realize why you do what you do.It was only during my residency in ophthalmology that I realized the reason why I took this arduous profession. To demonstrate why I say so I will share with you my experiences during my Ophthalmology residency. I call it the 3 miracles.3 miraclesThese 3 stories are what i call miracles not only for those patients but also how it changed my outlook towards myprofession and when I finally realized how much difference I alone could bring to the world.Miracle 1 : When i was ending the 1st yr of my residency, I had just started doing cataract surgeries independently and confidently. One day in the clinic a woman about 60 yrs of age entered who had mature cataracts in both eyes. In fact she was so blind that she had to be supported by 2 people into the clinic room. For all practical purposes she was totally handicapped. I examined her and did the workup and got her admitted. My boss gave me the opportunity to operate on her.i operated on both eyes just a week apart from each other. The day after i operated on the second eye i entered the wards early in the morning and observed the most beautiful sight in the world. That same patient who needed 2 people to support her everywhere was running around the wards excitedly laughing and talking to all the other patients. The patient and their relatives somehow knew i was the one who operated on her. Theywere so thankful to me that I was touched. That was the the most satisfying moment of my professional life until then.Miracle 2 : It was sometime during the second year of my residency. A 22yr old woman came to our hospital. She had a condition called Congenital Blepharoptosis of one eye, where one of the eyelidscannot be lifted like the other hence creating an asymetry in her facial features. Its not a life-threatening or a significant visual handicap but it made an unsightly appearance due to which she was notgetting married. Lot of hospitals had refused to operate on her saying its a cosmetic problem and was finally referred to my institute since its a govt institute and the patient was poor. I personally took up the case and worked it up and my boss as he has always done entrusted me with the operation. I operated on her and the operation was a huge success and it improved her appearance manifold. Shewas discharged and I had almost forgotten about it. Then one day about 5 months later when i was seeing patients in the clinic, that woman with her father had searched the whole hospital looking for me and finally found me in the clinic. They had come to invite me to her wedding which was fixed after the operation. This was such a humbling experience. That day I realised that no problem of the patient is small and that we have so much power to change their lives if we show empathy totheir woes.Miracle 3 : I was in my final year of residency and was working in a retina unit. A depressed young woman walked into our clinic. She had a painful blind eye which needed to be removed. She had anunsightly eye since childhood due to an accident and was very depressed with how it looked. I wanted to remove the eye and have an artificial prosthesis fitted so that it looked like a normal eye. My presentboss was not that enthusiastic since in government hospitals due to the high case loads, they often remove a painful eye and leave it like that without thinking of the social stigma it may cause. And being aretina surgeon he was not sure whether it would turn out well. But I persisted and finally convinced him to admit that patient. I operated on that eye and fitted an implant and prosthesis. It was a success. in 2 months time she had a prosthetic eye and nobody looking at her from far away would have realised she did not have an eye. Even my boss who was skeptical initially was very impressed. I was travelling in the metro train after work one evening and that woman and her husband approached me there. I almost didnt recognize them. Both of them were looking so happy and they were so grateful. I wish i could have captured their joy in my camera but couldnt. This was the best gift I could get for all the effort I took to get her operated ""properly"" : HER SMILE.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"This article in question has gone viral and has found resonance among thousands of doctors who see a lot of what was said in the article.I'm sure the OP is not a medical professional since the OP finds this article an overtly pessimistic view of the profession. It may surprise or even shock many people but all of what the author said is true. Non-medicos may call it whining but there seems to be no one listening to us.I don't want to whine or rant but I think I need to clarify certain issues. I love my job. Make no mistake, it is a wonderful profession. One of the joys of being a doctor is having the power to change a person's life and livelihood with one accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A doctor may not move nations or even sometimes not even impress the patient he's treating but power to positively impact another person's life is incredible to say the least and I suspect is the reason why doctors still continue to perfect their art and science. Money is not the reason.As a doctor I only wish they let me just do my job.There is this underlying myth that doctors make a lot of money during their careers which is really not true. I had a conversation with a friend from the money making tech industries and he had this to say""Doctors can't contribute enough financially to the nation to command higher salaries. A doctor ONLY saves lives but engineers,financial analysts and CEOs create wealth which they distribute among themselves.""Fair enough!This is how much value saving lives commands. I was angry at what he said at first but later realized this is how the money creating industries think of doctors: overpaid and untrustworthy. Life and death can't be quantified in stocks and bonds and hence that is not enough. It made me sad as to how this came to pass and this perception is precisely what the next generation of doctors will have to work against.Are there rich doctors? Of course there are! What one doesn't realize is the success stories of successful doctors are projected to represent the entire community of doctors while the stories of the suffering of younger doctors/medical students are not highlighted.As an example, I'm sure the people who believe that Dr. Roshan's article was an exaggeration would not have read this story:Who takes care of doctors in BMC-run hospitals? | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & AnalysisAre there rich actors? Yes. Are there poor actors. Again yes. The poor in fact outnumber the very rich by a large margin. It is the same with doctors.Violence against doctorsThe indifference of the public to this issue in India is so acute that a foreign author had to write about it. Link below:Why Indian doctors fear for their livesGovernments post newly minted post-graduate doctors into rural areas on compulsory postings but on temporary jobs. We have the media and governments shouting how this was necessary as doctors are reluctant to serve in rural areas. We don't see them asking:Why they are reluctant to go?Why is the pay so bad?  (Rs. 25,000 p.m. for 3 years, really???)Why is the infrastructure of the rural hospitals so bad? How will having doctors without infrastructure do any good for rural healthcare?Some orthopaedic surgeons are forced to deliver babies in these rural hospitals since there is not even a midwife in these places. My oncologist friend was posted in a rural based medical college in TN and all that he could do in that hospital was write referring letters to hospitals in the city for 3 years. It is just cheap labor for the exchequer, vote banks are taken care of and they don't have to bother about a permanent solution for a complex problem like rural health. This inability of the society to acknowledge their altruism will be the reason to discourage the next generation of brilliant students from taking up this unforgiving profession. Doctors are no more demigods or authorities in their field. Their medical decisions will be altered by arm twisting untrusting patients, fear of malpractice suits, defensive medicine, target hounding corporate hospitals, a populist government and an inefficient law system. All this stress while their family still suffers from the lack of their time and money.One last aspect I would like to highlight is the public non-understanding of risk of any procedure or surgery. Their unwillingness to listen to the risks and complications is appalling. Only when something untoward happens do they go to nail the doctor/hospital. People do not understand that everytime they undergo an invasive test, procedure or surgery they are putting their life at risk. This is inevitable part of medicine that this risk needs to be taken or nothing can be done about morbidity and disease.A couple of days ago in Bangalore a lady lost her life while undergoing a ""regular"" hystero-salpingography. She had adverse reaction to Buscopan- an anti-spasmodic agent to relax her bladder muscles. The injection is a regular practice in this procedure. The link is below:Mystery shrouds death in a diagnostic centre - Bangalore Mirror?Now the family of the diseased is baying for the blood of the doctors and the diagnostic center. Who is really at fault here?Let me give you some facts. 1. How many reports of Buscopan causing sudden death?Is SUDDEN DEATH a side effect of BUSCOPAN (SCOPOLAMINE BUTYLBROMIDE) ? ( FactMed.com )​​​​Check the hollow arrow- Yes you read it right, it is one death.2. Average percentage for all medicated patients where SUDDEN DEATH is reported as a complication- check the circled figure- 0.0431%With these numbers do you think it is unreasonable that the doctor was not prepared for the adverse reaction?More people have died consuming Paracetamol (your friendly Crocin) than people have died due to Buscopan.Do you think facts like these hold up in court? No, because the public has already announced its verdict: Hang them!Do you still think that Dr. Roshan Radhakrishnan was exaggerating?Edit 1:I thought of adding my comment on Quora User's answer to the same question as it helps make my answer more complete and puts things in perspective.I agree whining about long hours,studies and sacrifices of family life and time-  is not the right way to start improving things. Those will exist and it is present all over the world.But yes things we require are1. Better conditions and infrastructure2. Safer working atmosphere3. A fair pay scale 4.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I've shouted myself hoarse about futility of Ayurveda and Homeopathy treatments on most of the chronic diseases but perceptions are yet to change. The frauds and quacks are not just limited to small timers. The quackery is now a multi billion dollar industry based in India thanks to various sops by the Indian Government. The same Indian government taxes imported medical implants and drugs but doesn't bother about taxing these. Some forms of ayurvedic medicine contain alcohol and these are sometimes cheaper than the cheapest commercially available alcohol. That too is sometimes a lucrative business strategy for these companies. Other drugs contain unacceptable levels of lead, arsenic and mercury.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm a man but I have several friends, colleagues and relatives who have/are successfully managed/ing motherhood so I can probably give a little insight.I'll try to highlight the condition of a woman doctor in the Indian scenario. Parents, in-laws, husband too should take take more responsibility in the household and in taking care of the to be mother and the baby when it comes. Family support has a huge role to play...more so than in other professions. Here's why:1. Emergencies: Medical profession is hands-on job and emergencies and exigencies occur without warning at hospitals. Despite the female doctor decision to reduce her schedule, if she has to be successful, she has to work hard in this profession. Clinical medicine is unforgiving and surgical fields even more so.2. No maternity benefits: World over (excluding India and some third world countries) doctors working in hospitals get paid maternity leave, Full Hospital support, creche/ play home facility inside the hospital for the kids and other allowances.But in India a doctor has to go on unpaid maternity leave, corporate hospitals quietly throw out pregnant consultants and residents making excuses and there are no facilities to reduce a lady doctor's burden. When the healthcare sector can take the corporate culture when making money but forget to incorporate the good practices from the other MNCs and corporates....it is just selective capitalism.3. Finances: Doctors don't earn enough to even feed themselves till they finish training so they do not not have huge savings to bank upon during pregnancy and motherhood. Motherhood and raising a child nowadays involves a huge cost. They cannot afford to keep full time maids/caretakers/Nanny/babysitters like most people their age. Their husband has to work doubly hard to make up for the loss of income from their spouse due to the above reason.4. Medical training takes a long time in a doctors life. If a lady wants to be a super specialist and if she's lucky it could be north of 12 years before she can even practice. The unlucky ones take several more years. So assuming everyone starts at 18 yrs they'll be atleast 30 before they can finish their training commitnents. So oftentimes they have to handle marriage, pregnancy, maternity and taking care of kids along with their ongoing training or sometimes have to take a break from training. The women certainly do all of this and more with aplomb.That said it truly amazes me how women doctors manage all the challenges of motherhood and never complain. Hats off to them.

There are some books in the market which have previous years NIMHANS question papers with answers. I forget the name. I've not read it but I believe some repeat questions do come from that.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"First every Plastic Surgery aspirant needs to know the difference between Reconstructive and Aesthetic (cosmetic) Plastic SurgeryRaghuraj S. Hegde's answer to What is the difference between cosmetic surgery and reconstructive surgery?In India you have some optionsAfter MBBS, you can do your residency in General surgery (MS/DNB) followed by doing an Mch/DNB in Plastic Surgery. There are some integrated Plastic Surgery residencies such as 6yr Mch in AIIMS and 5yr DNB Plastic Surgery residencies too. Another way is to take my path towards Aesthetic and Reconstructive surgery. First do residency in Ophthalmology (MS/MD/DNB) followed by a fellowship in Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery. But the cosmetic surgery practice will be restricted to the face- Brow lifts, face-lifts, blepharoplasties, BOTOX, fillers, etc. Almost 80% of cosmetic surgeries are on the face so rest assured it is not a bad deal.You may want to read this too:Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to What is Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery?But you need to be aware that Plastic Surgery residencies and Oculoplasty fellowships in India are usually focussed on function, restoration and reconstruction rather than aesthetics. For example Plastic surgeons are trained in breast reconstructions and not Breast augmentations. Not many residencies/fellowships give any sort of training in aesthetic surgeries in India. It is of course important to realise that Aesthetic surgery is based on a solid foundation of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery. So if your Reconstructive work is excellent, your aesthetic work too will be great. One way to get more experience in aesthetic surgery is to do fellowships abroad like I did. Popular countries for fellowships in aesthetic surgery is Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, US, UK and even some new cities of China.However, though the demand for Aesthetic Surgery is rising in India there are very few dedicated Aesthetic surgeons in India. This is because there is so much work in Reconstructive and Functional cosmetic surgery that it is hard to let go. In my present practice in Bangalore, 90% of the surgeries I perform are Reconstructive and rest are Aesthetic. I consider every patient I see as an aesthetic patient, so even my reconstructive patients receive aesthetic outcomes.In the US and in many western countries, ENT and Ophthalmic surgeons are the ones who go into Plastic Surgery (aesthetic and Reconstructive) rather than General surgeons. In India there is less of that trend.Thanks for the A2A Pavan Kumar",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The witty patient!!Lot of our daily practice in our clinics would involve seeing patients,making quick diagnoses and discussing various treatment options. We do sometimes joke with our patients to make it a more comfortable environment but most of our work though intellectually stimulating is not so much humorous. One patient of mine impressed me with her quick wittedness.A lady came into my clinic with red eyes and red angry lower eyelids. It wasn't fitting into any particular diagnosis other than allergic dermatitis.So on repeated questioning she finally confessed that she arm twisted her dermatologist to prescribe her bimatoprost for getting long eyelashes.Bimatoprost is an anti glaucoma drug whose side effect is long eyelashes. So drug companies and cosmetologists have started using this side effect as a cosmetic tool. But another side effect is it can cause allergic reaction which was the case here in this patient.I explained to her that the eye drops  have caused her allergy.Just then my boss walks in.She says to him ""Doctor we just discovered what caused my red eyes""""What would that be?""

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"There are many factors.Primary is cost. Due to the high number of surgeries in India doctors and hospitals are able to obtain instruments and consumables at a lower rate than in other countries. Also sometimes hospitals obtain consumables directly through source company which eliminates the middle men. I have even seen high volume hospitals even produce their own consumables in a factory. This and low remuneration of doctors in India drives down total costs hence the US$250,000 surgery in US can be done for US$ 5-10k in India with sometimes better results in India.Then comes expertise. Indian surgeons operate on 10 times more cases than a similar surgeon in Europe or US. Hence even surgeons conform to Malcolm Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule. Indian surgeons get there faster than their western counterparts.JUGAD. Indian doctors are brilliant at making do with less resources and this I consider as our USP.English.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Yes it is totally worth it provided you do it for the right reasons and understand the surgery well. It is one of the many oculoplasty procedures that have a good success rate in capable hands. It is also important to not have unrealistic ecpections from surgery. Surgeons have to work with what is given and cannot perform magic.A cost- benefit analysis that both you and the surgeon should do before deciding on surgery.The benefits? You can see better from the affected eye, both eyes are symmetrical and hardly anyone would notice that you had the surgery unless they know you from before. Cost. Cost of surgery of course and the mental make up to undergo surgery. I wouldn't quote actual numbers since numbers are really no indication whether anything can go wrong with your surgery.So let's look at your opitions.What are the chances your Ptosis will be better after the surgery? -say- 80-90% ( not credible numbers, only representative)What is the chances that your medical condition will get better without surgery- 0%Surgeries for eyelid ptosis can vary depending on the cause of the ptosis.No surgery in the world is risk free.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I can tell you from the Indian perspective.One reason is superstition. For example people do not donate their eyes in the mistaken belief that when we donate a dead person's eyes that person will be born blind in their next life. These kinds of superstitious beliefs take place even among doctors who should know better.Second would be religion. I'm  going to stick my neck out and point out that the Muslim community in India has the lowest levels of organ donation. I'm not sure why this is so but ironically they formed the biggest proportion of recipients of corneal transplants in the institute I did my residency. In some middle eastern (Gulf) countries organ donation is illegal, hence they come to India for their transplantation. People would ask me for evidence but no one in government would allow for census on such a sensitive issue in India especially when it shows Muslims in negative light. When I last checked, Muslims make 24% of India's population and that's nearly 24% who don't donate their organs.Third would be government apathy and outdated rules. The human transplantation act was done in 1994 and has seen very little change since then. There is no effort on the government's part to encourage organ donation. No incentive to establish NGOs to work on organ donation. No training of grief councellors in hospitals and no proper organ retrieval programs or established protocols.Fourth and maybe a small reason is corporate profit. Corporate hospitals cash in on this high demand for organs and have a subtle mafia running wherein the best tissues are preferentially given to private entities and they control how many good tissues are in the market.The fifth and final point which may be the most important is attitude. Most people don't want to save/improve other people's lives with donating the organs of their dead family members even if they are going to just rot or burn after death. They do not understand how tough it is to get an organ donor for ones who really need it. Only when they are in the shoes of that parent who needs a kidney for their child will they ever understand how it feels. In my experience I have seen people flatly refuse organ donation even when the diseased before his/her death had expressed desire to donate after death. Once the family refuses doctors or the government is helpless. I can understand emotions run high when a loved one dies and they may see organ donation as body mutilation but they should realize that one person's body could possibly improve the lives of many people's lives. That in itself is the greatest legacy a person can leave behind.Edit: Sheng Xiao raised an argument in favour of organ trade Vs Organ donation.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The answer is NO-  they should not be barred from appearing in civil services exam. The simple premise of my argument is the concept of meritocracy in every sphere of our country. If we restrict some of the most talented people of our country engaging in public discourse, administration, governance and social change we as a country are losing out on their contributions. We need intelligent people in our administration and people getting into IITs and Medical School are among the intellectual cream of our society, so how would it be fair that we ban them from the Indian Civil Services?Not only medical and engineering graduates but there should be no bar on any citizen of our country to move up to governance, administration and bureaucracy. If we hope to create an egalitarian society we have to recognize the equality of all professions and not cherry pick doctors and engineers as important professions. The understanding of the Dignity of labour is very poor among Indians so no profession should be elite so as to speak.We need more stories like theseAn inspirational story - Waiter to IAS officer - MotivationalAnother pertinent point is that the degrees of medical and engineering graduates do not become irrelevant once they become IAS officers. I could go on and on but these are just a few examples.1. A Deputy commissioner (DC) who has a civil engineering background could do wonders for a district's or city's infrastructure projects. He has in depth knowledge of what it takes to build things than a DC from a humanities background.2. A bureaucrat who is a doctor would similarly be indispensable in the health ministry and medical education department where others wouldn't know how to handle the intricacies of medical legislature and medical corruption.3. An electronics and communications engineer who then goes on to become an IPS officer can bring in several changes in law and order which can be taken care of by new technology- CCTV surveilance, cyber theft, online harassment, social networking of the police force, etc. (True story- my very close friend,an engineer IPS officer did the same and has used technology to curb Naxalite problems in the area of his service, so much so that he has got death threats and attempts on his life due to his work)4. A District Collector (DC) who is a doctor can be of immense use in mobilizing resources, prevention of water borne diseases and medical aid in times of disasters like earthquakes, floods and famines. The health sector in India is mangled in red tape and corruption. We in fact need more doctors to enter the IAS cadre to listen to the doctor's side of the story. We need some solutions for the issues regarding healthcare sector which are not being addressed. The communication gap is alarmingly large.For referenceRaghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Medicine and Healthcare: Why do Indian doctors refuse to work in villages?The argument of IIT graduates wasting seats others would have gladly taken is not supported by statistics. Let us look at some statistics: each year more than 200,000 engineers graduate from around 1200 engineering colleges in the country — 3,000 from the 7 IITs alone. Tamil Nadu, for instance, has 200 or so colleges offering 60,000 seats annually and many seats go vacant for want of takers. The entire annual civil service intake is now only around 500 and even if there are 40 or 50 IITians this would amount to only a tiny per cent of the engineers being churned out by the country or, even from the IITs.IIT graduates in the IASThe above article in 2003 by a Tamil Nadu IAS cadre officer answers many of the doubts regarding this practice.Do other countries restrict their professionals from getting into administration?Dr. Murthy, who took the oath on the Gita, is now the highest ranking Indian-American in the Obama administration.“To have the opportunity to serve as Surgeon-General is an extraordinary honour and a profound responsibility, and I want to thank President Obama for entrusting me with the stewardship of this office,” he said in his address on the occasion at Fort Myer military base.Dr. Murthy is the country’s 19th Surgeon General.http://m.thehindu.com/news/inter...Most importantly, we have many engineers and doctors moving abroad and becoming citizens of other countries. This was known as brain drain until a few years ago till the dollars trickled in from abroad. Slowly  Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella became poster boys of Indian aspirations. However a doctor or engineer who wishes to serve in the administration and governance of his own country is looked down upon and accused of selfishness. If you restrict careers for talented individuals in India the natural result is going to be that they are going to look elsewhere for opportunities to showcase their talent and where they will be appreciated. This benefits neither our country nor the individuals concerned. Something to think about, don't you think?Thanks for the A2A Shesha Shayana C",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"To answer this question, first you need to know what colour blindness is.What is colour blindness?Colour Blindness is a x linked recessive gene inherited condition. It is seen in about 5% of the population. It is seen mostly in males and rarely in females. It is maternally inherited and usually seen in the male line of the family. Colour Blindness does not mean actual blindness but impairment of colour vision. The impairment is usually part of a spectrum from high to low. It is very rare that someone would see the world in black and white so as to speak.It was first described by John Dalton, an English chemist and physicist in 1798. He basically discovered his own colour blindness hence it was known as Daltonism for sometime but today it is only referred to one kind of colour blindness- Deuternopia.The basic pathophysiology is that the genes that code for retinal cones that percieve colour are at fault. The types retinal cones usually correspond to the three primary colours Red, Blue and Green. Deficiency of any of these types can give rise to one of three forms of colour blindness-ProtanomalyDeuteranomalyTritanomalyAchromatopsia - extremely rareComing back to the question...The simple answer is that they should avoid professions where correctly identifying a particular colour is critical to their profession and safe for others if they are colour blind.But often these are not so simple. Many colour blind people are not even aware of their colour-blindness till they are identified by colour vision testing before they join a profession or course where colour vision testing is mandatory. Some professions where colour forms an important part of their job and also critical for the safety of others around them.List is not exhaustive1. Pilots- commercial or Air force2. Electricians3. Scientists4. Defence forces including paramilitary forces.5. Food and art critics (yes, them too)6. Doctors - not total contraindication. One of my mentors was partially colour blind but was an incredible eye surgeon. Several of my colleagues are colour blind.7. Engineers- especially the non coding type- think electrical, mining, mechanical.Of course many times the lines are not so solid. Several times we don't know whether a particular type of colour blindness incapacitates them from doing a particular job. For example the first reported person with colour blindness, John Dalton was a chemist, physicist and meteorologist. He was instrumental in pioneering the modern atomic theory and also did pioneering work in colour blindness. So clearly colour blindness had little impact on his life. The truth of the matter is people compensate with the things they have if they didn't know they are missing something.A colour blind person can lead almost a normal life with much handicap. Unfortunately our government agencies and our modern world requires certain criteria to join certain professions. This is what has happened in the case of your friend. Sometimes these criteria are applied so strictly that it doesn't make sense. So in your friend's case it should not be a problem for a bank job and if they do create a problem you have sufficient grounds for appeal. You can even send them a legal notice if they reject your friend solely on the basis of his colour impairment.Thanks for the A2A Quora User",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,Do you have any evidence for the claim that you make? That the number of people needing lenses/glasses are increasing. It is a common fallacy to believe that people with refractive errors are increasing.One reason why more people seem to be using glasses is because more people can afford them than before and also because our population is more than before.A lot of people have refractive error that is quite less and they manage to go about their daily activities without needing glasses or do not realize they need glasses. Some worked in professions that did not need perfect long distance sight such as farming and menial professions in rural areas. Now with many more educated people moving into cities and with jobs requiring better clarity in their distant vision then seek out vision checks and thus end up with glasses.Also education has a lot to do with more people seeking out ophthalmologists/optometrists for checking their refractive errors than was previously.School eye screenings are recognizing refractive errors much earlier than before.It is not that refractive errors did not exist before or was less before. It is only that it is better taken care of now,high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I support the Consumer protection act in it's spirit to make a doctor accountable for any wrong that may have been done. But like in the US, in India too this act is being used to harass decent doctors and small hospitals. I would like to mention just 1 exampleA man was admitted in a hospital to remove a tumour in his adrenal gland (near the kidneys in the abdomen). The surgery was done but he unfortunately developed Meningitis - which is an infection of the coverings of the brain. In spite of all efforts done the man died due to the infection. So now the wife sues the hospital and doctor for the death for Rs. 45 lakhs. It went all the way up to supreme court before it squashed the claim saying it was frivolous. It noted that too many frivolous claims are making the rounds of courts for malpractice suits in the hope of pinning the loss of life or injury of a patient on doctors so that they can claim compensation from them. They issued a 11- point guideline to be adhered to before a case is admitted to trial.Here is the excerpt of the guidelines""It is a matter of common knowledge that after some unfortunate event, there is a marked tendency to look for a human factor to blame for an untoward event, a tendency which is closely linked with the desire to punish,"" said Justice Bhandari, writing the judgment for the Bench. Tracing the development of the law in major cases of medical negligence in India and other countries, especially UK, the Bench collated a 11-point guideline for the courts to adjudicate complaints against doctors. They are: * Negligence is a breach of duty or an act which a prudent and reasonable man will not do * Negligence to be established by the prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the negligence merely based upon an error of judgment * Medical professional is expected to bring a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge along with a reasonable degree of care but neither the highest nor the lowest degree of care and competence * A doctor would be liable only where his conduct fell below that of the standard of a reasonably competent practitioner in the field * Difference of opinion cannot be cited as negligence * Just because a professional looking at the gravity of illness had taken a higher element of risk to redeem the patient out of his suffering which did not yield the desired result, it may not amount to negligence * Merely because a doctor chooses one course of action in preference to the other one available, he would not be liable if the action chosen by him was acceptable to the medical profession * It would not be conducive to the efficiency of the medical profession if no doctor could administer medicine without a halter round his neck * It is our duty not to harass or humiliate medical professionals unnecessarily so as to allow them to perform their duties without fear and apprehension * Doctors at times have to be saved from such class complaints who use criminal process as a tool for pressurising them or hospitals and clinics for extracting uncalled for compensation * Doctors are entitled to get protection so long as they perform their duties with reasonable skill and competence and in the interest of the patientsPage on timesofindia.com  I think the general public should read up these guidelines before blaming hospitals and doctors for everything. This underlying myth that doctors make huge amounts of money in India is unfounded. Most doctors in India are salaried and are middle class in wealth indicators. So huge malpractice lawsuits even if frivolous puts in a huge amount of stress-financially, professionally and emotionally. It may end the doctor's career even if he did no wrong. This trend is certainly not healthy. This will give rise to defensive medicine, unnecessary tests and scans- not because hospitals and doctors want to make more money-but because there is trust deficit  and each patient is seen as a potential lawsuit in the making. People have to understand that any invasive procedure/treatment or surgery has potential risks to life and limb. Hospitals and doctors will not take the additional risk to save a life for the fear of such lawsuits. You certainly do not want that!",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"No.Sunglasses do not harm your eyes provided you wear sunglasses with UV protection.We don't need sunglasses to protect our eyes from sunlight. The eyes have a natural mechanism to constrict the pupil in bright sunlight to reduce amount of sunlight entering.If you wear sunglasses without UV protection....it is harmful. Reason? Under the glasses the pupils dilate and the amount of sunlight (and thus UVlight) entering the eye increases thus causing eye damage in the long run. That's the basic eye physiology.Sunglasses are sometimes required in people and professionals having long exposures to the sun. It protects their eyes from excessive UV rays which causes a range of eye problems like cataracts, solar retinopathy, eye and eyelid cancers, etc. So in professions like farming, truck driving, professional skiers and other outdoor sportsmen where there is a high dose of UV light exposure the UV filtered sunglasses without a doubt help prote t the eyes.But you don't need it to go on a picnic in the sun once a year.You would do more harm to your eyes by using a NON-UV filter coated sunglasses.As for your other queries. Sunglasses are a modern construct why use them? Sunscreen,spectacles and medicines are also a modern construct but we do recognise the value of its use so use them. So is sunglasses.We don't need long term studies to determine common sense of the hypothesis that UV causes eye damage and its difficult to design long term studies on damage to eyes with sunglass usage because it has so many variables which can cause so many biases in the study.Also for heaven's sake optic nerve does not need sunlight (one of the answers suggested that)... Light hardly reaches the optic nerve in any case.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"WHAT IS PTOSIS AND HOW IS IT CORRECTED?Ptosis is a condition that occurs when one or both upper eyelids droop and the edge of the upper eyelid falls towards or over the pupil. Ptosis is usually caused by stretching or thinning of the tendon between the muscle that normally raises the eyelid and the eyelid itself. With stretching or thinning, the muscle that normally raises the eyelid has to work harder to lift it. This leads to symptoms of eyelid and forehead muscle fatigue and eyelid heaviness. Other less common causes of ptosis are nerve and muscle damage from any cause, various types of eyelid surgery, infection, muscle weakness, systemic diseases such as stroke and tumors behind the eye, myasthenia, hypertension, thyroid disorders and diabetes. This condition usually lasts until it is surgically corrected. There are no non- surgical ways to correct Ptosis.Ptosis surgery is not the procedure of choice for removing excess fat and skin in the upper eyelid- that is Upper lid Blepharoplasty. Under certain circumstances both surgeries can be combined when fat and skin removal is an added goal of surgery.To correct Ptosis, the surgeon needs to make an incision or cut the skin of the upper eyelid in order to reach the muscles and tendons. The surgeon chooses where to make the incision based upon what treatment the eyelid needs. With the front or anterior approach, the surgeon makes an incision in the skin in the upper eyelid crease or fold in order to reach the muscle and tendon, if there is no eyelid fold, one can be created when the incision is made. The anterior approach allows the surgeon to trim excess skin and fatty tissue from the upper eyelid if needed during the surgery. If no skin or fat needs to be removed, the surgeon can raise the eyelid through an inside approach by placing the incision on the inside or moist part of the upper eyelid; with this approach, there is no cosmetic scarring .If the muscle is not strong enough to lift the eyelid, the surgeon must create a “sling” by connecting the moving eyelid to the frontalis muscle in the forehead.HOW WILL PTOSIS SURGERY AFFECT MY VISION AND APPEARANCE?The droopy eyelid is like a curtain that blocks the view. Patients with Ptosis frequently notice that they have less peripheral or side vision, particularly when looking up. The more severe the ptosis, the greater is the peripheral vision loss. When the eyelid is raised, either manually by hand or surgically through one of the approaches described above, the blockage is removed and the eye can see. Ptosis surgery only corrects vision loss due to droopy eyelids. It does not improve blurred vision caused by problems inside the eye, or by visual loss caused by neurological disease behind the eye. To prevent amblyopia or poor visual development in children born with congenital ptosis, the surgery needs to be done early in life.Patients with ptosis report that droopy eyelids make them look and feel “tired“. When the eyelid is raised in ptosis surgery, patients usually prefer the new eyelid position, and feel it improves their appearance as well as their peripheral vision. When only one eyelid is raised, it may affect how the eyelid on the other side looks. If this happens, ptosis on the other side may be needed. If the position and shape of the eyelids do not match, additional surgery may be needed. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR RISKS OF PTOSIS SURGERY?Risks of ptosis surgery, like most eyelid surgical procedures include but are not limited to : bleeding, infection, an asymmetric or unbalanced appearance, scarring, difficulty closing the eyes(which may cause damage to the underlying corneal surface), a “wide-eyed” or “open” appearance, difficulty with or inability to wear contact lenses, double vision, tearing, or dry eye problems, numbness and/or tingling in the operated eyelid, near the eye, or on the face, and in rare cases, loss of vision. The aim of the surgery is to lift the upper eyelid and to make both sides look symmetrical when looking straight ahead. Sometimes the eyelid position may not be symmetrical when looking in different gazes. While ptosis correction is usually permanent, the condition can recur. If it does, you may need to have repeat surgery.The result of ptosis surgery cannot be guaranteed. Ptosis correction involves surgery on the tendon and/ or muscle inside the eyelid, which can make the results unpredictable. At times, the surgeon may need to adjust the position and shape of the eyelid after ptosis surgery. The adjustments can be done early (within the first ten days) after surgery, or later on if asymmetry of the eyelid position or shape occur. The final result depends upon your anatomy, your body’s wound healing response, and the underlying cause of the ptosis. Some patients have difficulty adjusting to changes to their appearance. Some patients have unrealistic expectations about how changes in appearance will impact their lives. Carefully evaluate your goals, expectations and your ability to deal with changes to your appearance and the possible need for repeat surgery before agreeing to this surgery.WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES TO PTOSIS SURGERY?Patients can live with ptosis and blocked and reduced peripheral vision; however, there is no reliable method to correct ptosis on a permanent basis without surgery. Patients who are too sick to have surgery may find relief by lifting their eyelid with their fingers or tape in order to see. Obviously, the eyelid droops again as soon as this temporary lifting is stopped.Please consult a qualified Ophthalmic Plastic Surgeon (Oculoplastic surgeon) for any additional information.",high,high,high,low,low

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Thanks for the A2A Rajdeep BhattiI find the exit exam proposition by the government a tortuous route instead of taking a much simpler route by improving the standards of medical education by honestly regulating it.Medical Council of India regularly has medical college inspections in all the medical colleges approved by them in India. Why then does the standard of medical education vary so much between what is taught at premier institutes like AIIMS and JIPMER and those barely there private medical colleges? It is the inherent corruption in the system.The education varies so much because of many many substandard medical colleges without adequate infrastructure, faculty or sometimes even without any patients. I know so many medical students who have cleared their final year exams without seeing a single patient in final year. That is how much the education varies between medical colleges. Why is this being allowed in India?Medical education is big business where the investors are set to make crores of rupees by selling seats to paying people. It takes a starting capital investment of about Rs. 300-400 crores to set up a new private medical college including all the bribes they have pay to the MCI officials. No wonder Ketan Desai is so rich and (in)famous.CBI Director Privately Met Five Times With Disgraced Ex-MCI President Ketan Desai As Corruption Case Against  Desai Still Lingers In CBI CourtHow ludicrous it seemed when Kasturba Medical College, Manipal , a 62 year old private medical college- which has produced some of the best doctors in India including Devi Shetty was stripped of it's MCI accreditation by the corrupt MCI officials because allegedly the medical college refused to pay the bribes this time.

Yet Ketan Desai is a free man today and is apparently today the President elect of World Medical Association.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"A2AThe prefix ""Dr."" before a name Or ""Doctor"" to address people has been misused in India.The word Doctor originated from the Latin verb ""docere"" meaning ""to teach""It has been in use for more than a thousand years. It first started to be used in Europe before being used in the rest of the world. It denotes any person who has obtained a doctorate level degree in a university. The doctorate may be research or professional. Interestingly even lawyers have been historically referred as doctors since in the older times Theology, Law and Medicine were intertwined by the church which originally awarded the titles of doctor to people.In modern times and in the context of India.Any person who has been awarded Ph.D after research work by a university recognized by the University Grants Commission (UGC) is entitled by right to be called ""Doctor"" and prefixed with the title ""Dr"".According to the Medical Council of India (MCI) and Dental Council of India (DCI) code of rules only persons with an MBBS or a BDS degree can be addressed as Doctor and prefix a title of ""Dr"" to their name. In this instance the word doctor is used as a noun and not an adjective like in the case of a Ph.D where it indicates the highest degree in the university.Except the above no other professional  can be addressed as ""Doctor"" or prefix ""Dr"" in IndiaThe problem is compounded in India where even practitioners of AYUSH* systems of Medicine and Pharmacists are routinely referred to as ""Doctors"". The accurate term for practitioners of AYUSH* would be Vaid, Yogi, Hakim, Siddhar and Homoeopath respectively. But these terms are hardly used in cities by these practitioners.*AYUSH - Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Sidda and Homeopathy - branches of alternative medicine.Pharmacists in India do not usually address or prefix themselves with ""Doctor"" or ""Dr"". If they do they might get into trouble with local authorities.Also I see a recent trend in Physiotherapists using the ""Dr."" prefix in their name boards and advertisements. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) issued a special circular clarifying the situation and  discouraging this practice. There are no fines mentioned for breaching these practices, hence this practice goes unabated in India.As for the question asked. Psychologists and Psycho-therapists without Ph.D cannot be addressed as ""Doctor"" or prefix ""Dr."" before their names. Neither as convention nor as courtesy like with medical doctors. If they do there are no laws or rules that can enforced like in other countries which is quite unfortunate. Educated people have to take it upon themselves to understand the difference before taking treatment or therapy from persons of alternative medicine, rehabilitation experts or mental health experts. People should not pay too much attention to the Dr. prefix especially in the Indian context as it has lost its meaning.I believe the same with white coats and have ditched the same in my practice.PS: Another interesting trivia is that lawyers in Goa state are addressed as ""Doutor"" in an indication of its Portuguese heritage.

Cases get dragged over many many years and eventually the guilty are set free due to decomposition of the evidence over time...so it is pretty easy for a govt official to be corrupt and lead a comfortable life without actually being punished for it.Indian govts does not lend itself to a free market like US. They believe in the socialist policies where they hand out freebies to the poor but don't give them employment opportunities to raise themselves from poverty. There is no corollary in India to the ""American Dream""India is fast going down the path that the rich will get richer and poor will get poorer. This will just make corruption that much harder to control.Thanks for the A2A Dakota Lim",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,I don't want to give you false hope but there are several late blooming doctors. Prime among them is Albert Schweitzer and Theo Seiler.Dr. Schweitzer was a musician till he was 30 years of age and then studying medicine and went on establish a fully functional hospital in West Africa. He also won the Nobel prize in peace.Theo Sieler was a professor in physics till 27 yrs of age. He attended a lecture in ophthalmology and then was inspired to study medicine and then went on to do a residency in ophthalmology. He discovered a revolutionary treatment for keratoconus and recently he was voted as the most influential ophthalmologist in the world by the world ophthalmology congress 2014.These 2 stories are shining examples but other not so shining do exist..For you to actually make it even as an regular plain vanilla doctor will require true passion and perseverance. Its not financially viable so if money is even one of your driving points then let me tell you it is not worth it.But if its dream you can't live without then do go ahead. But remember you will need to sacrifice a good part of your life to achieve it.,high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,It is a tough question to answer. I have done a fair bit of both clinical care and clinical research. I haven't done a lot of pure/basic sciences work (which would not be quite appealing to me). Medical doctors involved primarily in patient care and those involved in clinical research are often inter-dependent on each other. These days most doctors who also teach in medical schools divide their time between both patient care and research as we find that both need to co-exist.Personally I love patient care more than research but that's just me. I would say patient care has instant gratification and it can be achieved day in and day out without depending on anyone but yourself. Sometimes patient attitutes can be frustrating but there is more of the good than the bad.Research takes time and sometimes it can lead to a lot of frustration if it is not leading anywhere. But scientific research is like aged whisky. It has its own highs. Doctors are often recognized and immortalized for the kind of scientic contribution they do. And peer recognition is the biggest high a doctor can get so I wouldn't say its a bad trade off.On a scale patient care trumps for me but again that's just me!Thanks for the A2A Quora User,high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"""What is Ophthalmic plastic surgery or Oculoplasty?"" I often get asked this question when I tell them what I'm specializing in. Most people are not aware that such a speciality exists  including majority of medical doctors. They ask me how can you be an Ophthalmologist and a Plastic surgeon at the same time. It's a tedious exercise explaining it to people what my work comprises and one which makes my wife make fun of me when I explain because she's heard it so many times. I thought it would make sense to pen it down. Here it goes....Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery is a subspecialty of Ophthalmology which deals with the orbit (eye socket), eyelids, tear ducts, and the face. It also deals with the reconstruction of the eyelid, the eye socket, and surrounding structures. Lately as a natural progression this branch has been getting into Facial Aesthetics in a big way in the form of Brow lifts, facelifts,Botox, fillers and Facial Rejuvenation.The subspecialty of ophthalmic plastic surgery was born in the mid-twentieth century in the United States at the conclusion of World War II. The art of oculoplastic surgery, however, is centuries old, bearing its roots in antiquity in India,the Far East, and Europe.The various procedures that have evolved over centuries can be divided into several general categories: reconstructive, restorative,and cosmetic.  Oculoplastic surgeons have perfected, refined, and pioneered new techniques of lacrimal surgery, ptosis repair and blepharoplasty, orbital surgery, lid malpositions, and flaps and grafts. With the close relationship of this speciality with Eye Cancer and eye reconstruction after removal of tumours,  Oculoplastic surgeons are de-facto Ocular oncologists. Since the treatment of the above conditions often requires multidisiplinary approach the possibilities of this field are endless. It also requires good working relationship with other specialties and to create a valuable team to treat the patients.Oculoplastic surgery became recognized as a unique subspecialty of ophthalmology at the end of World War II. Numerous orbital and periocular injuries were treated by general ophthalmologists without prior training or exposure to ophthalmic plastic surgery. More often than not, trial and error were keys in developing these procedures. Among the earliest pioneers was Dr. John M. Wheeler who established a full practice based on oculoplastic surgery. He is known as the father of oculoplastic surgery. His student Wendel Hughes was the next major force in this field. Further Hughes' students Alston Callahan,Byron Smith and Crowell Beard propagated this field across the world. This group of Oculoplastic surgeons went on to found the American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons(ASOPRS) in 1969. This was the first such society in the world for oculoplastic surgeons. Later more such societies got formed in other parts of the world. Europe (ESOPRS), Canada (CSOPRS), Asia-Pacific (APSOPRS) and even India (OPAI).It is a relatively less known specialty. ( I myself did not know about it till I joined residency). There lies the challenge in this field and also the greatest opportunity to grow. The specialists in this field are there in it only for passion since the other sub-specialities in Ophthalmology are much more rewarding monetarily. This sub-speciality is quite hard to master yet it is incredibly satisfying. I am honoured and privileged to count myself among these stalwarts. Like I said the possibilities are endless and there is so much work to be done....References:1. Smith and Nesi's Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery2.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The rules say you can change your medical college but the reality is a little complicated.  I'm sure you have read the migration application and it's ruleshttp://www.mciindia.org/helpdesk...(1) Migration of students from one medical college to another medical college may be granted on any genuine ground subject to the availability of vacancy in the college where migration is sought and fulfilling the other requirements laid down in the Regulations. Migration would be restricted to 5% of the sanctioned intake of the college during the year. No migration will be permitted on any ground from one medical college to another located within the same city” Even though they say any genuine reason, the reasons allowed are very restricted.Some of these are:(1) Health of the concerned student in question(2) Death of a parent(3) Physical HandicapThis list is not exhaustive but not much else is usually entertained if you go through the normal procedure.Your marks do not matter. Medical schools in India place no importance for marks secured in professional exams but if you fail any of your subjects in first year you will be ineligible for transfer.Also the two key points to note in the rules is(1) Your present college should be willing to let you go (it is loss of revenue for them in the form of fees)(2) There should be a vacancy in the college that you want to transfer to and they should be willing to take you in. There is a lot of red tape involved here. (adding another student is expensive for a medical school and they have to justify it)There has to be some form of incentive for both colleges to facilitate your transfer. In India it does happen that the incentives are either monetary, influence or both.Also you need NOCs from DME, MCI and I'm sure many more other NOCs. One of my classmates in 1st year of medical school, after she cleared 1st year exams took a transfer from my college in Mysore to Rothak medical college. I don't think she had any valid reason for a change except probably convenience. It certainly helped that her parents were well known wealthy doctors in Delhi. Unless you have the reasons/influence/wealth that I have mentioned above there is very slim chances that your migration plan will work out. I would suggest you spend your energies in settling down in your present college and make the best of what you already have. A bird in hand is better than two in a bush.Thanks for the A2A. Hope it was helpful.Edit1: Apparently in Maharashtra it is possible to change you college based on your first professional marks and there is a rank list and counselling for the same. No such procedure exists in Karnataka where I did my MBBS.Thanks Quora User for this information.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"As a 15  year old you have a lot more questions than I had when I was your age. The key thing is never to regret any decision you take.As for the life of a doctor. I'll take out few paras from my blog post I wrote about a few months ago. Life of a 21st century doctor! by Raghuraj S. Hegde on raghurajhegdeQuality of life of a DoctorI'm not saying it is the toughest job on earth but a doctors life now harder than it has ever been. Very few vacations- no money during student life and no time once you are practicing.Family suffers. My father is a doctor and all through my childhood I resented the fact that we took so few family vacations and that my father was never there for the most important events in school or others. All the while he was working day and night to make ends meet and ensure that we, his children get the right education, amenities and taken care of. This made sure that I was a reluctant doctor for the most part of medical school. I eventually found my calling and was ""reformed"" but it was a painful journey nonetheless.It is going to get worse for the future generations. There is this underlying myth that doctors make a lot of money during their careers which is really not true. I had a conversation with a friend from the money making tech industries and he had this to say""Doctors can't contribute enough financially to the nation to command higher salaries. A doctor ONLY saves lives but engineers,financial analysts and CEOs create wealth which they distribute among themselves.""This is how much value saving lives commands. I was angry at what he said at first but later realized this is how the money creating industries think of doctors: overpaid and untrustworthy. Life and death can't be quantified in stocks and bonds and hence that is not enough. It made me sad as to how this came to pass and this perception is precisely what the next generation of doctors will have to work against.Governments post newly minted doctors into rural areas on compulsory postings but on temporary jobs. It is cheap labor for the exchequer, vote banks are taken care of and they don't have to bother about a permanent solution for a complex problem like rural health. What these people don't realize is that by having this attitude they will ultimately increase healthcare costs and then everybody suffers.This inability of the society to acknowledge their altruism will be the reason to discourage the next generation of brilliant students from taking up this unforgiving profession. Doctors are no more demigods or authorities in their field. Their medical decisions will be altered by arm twisting untrusting patients, fear of malpractice suits, defensive medicine, target hounding corporate hospitals, a populist government and an inefficient law system.All this stress while their family still suffers from the lack of their time and money.http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014...I just wrote another answer which might be useful for you.Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to How was your journey from high school to becoming a doctor?That said its been a very long road from being a reluctant doctor to an empathetic doctor and this journey has taught me a lot of lessons.One of the joys of being a doctor is having the power to change a person's life and livelihood with one accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. A doctor may not move nations or even sometimes not even impress the patient he's treating but power to positively impact another person's life is incredible to say the least and I suspect is the reason why doctors still continue to perfect their art and science. Doctors may not make millions of dollars like lawyers, engineers, management consultants and businessmen but the value they give the patient with their work is not measureable with any material affluence.Good luck and choose a field that you will love and not what your parents/ relatives/friends/neighbor auntie say you should. A Medical career needs an incredible amount of commitment so never take it for the wrong reasons. What you thought about medicine at 15 is not the same at 30 and will not be the same at 60. You will do well only if you are passionate about what you do.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I don't usually like self help books because most of what is preached is idealisms which are often not applicable in the real world. But I will make an exception on this one. My uncle gifted me this book when I was in college when I was in the midst of my own internal and external conflicts.Ok... not this vintage book, but a little modern version of the same book. I wouldn't have bought such a book myself due my disdain for such books. One Sunday afternoon I came across this pocket book and thought of just browsing through some pages. I was hooked from the 3rd page onwards. I completed the book by evening and the message in that book was so heavy and loaded that I re-read it several times during the next one week.This book was first published in 1936 based on the series of lectures he was giving at the time. Despite so many years past, his writing has some really sage advice and it still applies to our modern world. The one quality he puts across in that is that a human's basic social need is to be acknowledged and appreciated. No matter what his importance to the world is, every person thinks very highly of himself- from King to thief, from murderer to priest, depressed to maniacal- everyone thinks they are good people doing good things. It doesn't matter what everybody else thinks, he doesn't see anything wrong with himself. It is this inner person that one has to tap if you want to get across to people. This is one of the most brilliant concepts in human behavior. It does not mean flattery or pretentiousness like you put it, but it is a genuine appreciation for what other people do. It is a very complex concept and explaining it would become as big a book as Dale Carnegie's treatise.One of my favourite passages in this book is:If a man’s heart is rankling with discord and ill feeling toward you, you can’t win him to your way of thinking with all the logic in Christendom. Scolding parents and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging wives ought to realize that people don’t want to change their minds. They can’t be forced or driven to agree with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly.After reading this very small book, my approach to people changed slowly. Not that overnight I turned from introvert to extrovert- small changes practiced over many years. Now I make better connections with people and it helps immensely in my profession as a doctor. So next time you meet someone ask a genuine personalized question and a question you would actually wait for the answer. Good luck",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"The simple reason is numbers of the hoi polloi!The number of people who can appreciate brilliantly written prose are a minority. Many, even people with multiple doctorates cannot comprehend the beauty of prose (cf. Sheldon Cooper of BBT:-) )What sells is a simple easy to comprehend book with a compelling story (which may even be an old story rehashed). Sex obviously sells and there has to be Hollywood/Bollywood twists to the storyline. Any half-wit would know what's coming but continues reading it because it gives them a feeling of controlling the story. Writers like Sidney Sheldon and Robin Cook milked people for this particular trait. I did like some Sheldon books but after having read about 6-7 books, felt like I read them all. Chetan Bhagat is doing the same with Indian readers. (There a secret society of Chetan Bhagat haters on Quora:-))Also there is a huge uncatered market of people who want to read books and but do not intend to go deep into literature. They need television soaps in the form of books. Books like Twilight and FSOG serve this immensely untapped market. I could not get past 10 pages of first book of each series but 100 million women liked it so who am I to say it's bad literature.As for Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. I personally liked the book for the way the story was woven and not really for the prose. I liked Angels and Demons better. But then his other two earlier novels were such bull-crap I could have sworn that Da Vinci Code was written by a ghost writer. You need to sell something new and different from others. That is what worked with Dan Brown and by the quality of his latest offerings I just hope his writing dies a slow painful death.Mills and Boons series sells more than 200 million books annually despite weather beaten plots everyone including the scrap dealer knows about. What do you think is the reason?Publicity and marketing plays a huge role in book sales. 'A million little pieces' by James Frey (An addict's take on drugs) was widely publicized in the media as a true story. Even Oprah Winfrey endorsed it on her show. But it later turned out that Mr. Frey had fabricated vast amounts of the book to make it sound dramatic. Many characters he describes weren't even real. Oprah issued an apology and retraction but the damage was already done. Frey was a best selling author. I've read the book and it is 400 pages of living in a rehab. ""I spent all my dad's money on drugs and rehab"" is practically the whole book!If your book can hold the interest of 100 random people on the street, get them to read even half of your book and recommend it to others, you've got yourself a bestseller!!",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I never give specific medical advice to my friends especially if they ask me to diagnose something over the phone or randomly ask something at some get-together. I say I can only comment after examining them at my clinic and may even have to run some tests.With regard to the eyes which is my specialty I keep getting asked some random stuff or the other. Something like getting a call telling me that my eye has been itching and watering since 2 hours which drop can I put to get my eye better. I always politely advise them to see an ophthalmologist immediately. They say "" Naah! it doesnt seem that serious, gimme some drop to soothe the eye"". This time I would be stern and say ""it is not for you to decide whether it is serious or not. Get your ass off your chair and go seek professional help."" or something to that effect.:-)If suppose a friend or relative has been diagnosed with something and have been advised a certain procedure I do make it a point to get as much information to reach them as possible.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Well this is going to be pretty long story spanning 15 years or so. To circumvent a very long answer I shall provide links to my other answers and my blog posts.I come from a family of doctors and it was sort of a given that I would be pushed towards the medical  profession as a natural progression. Don't get me wrong. I loved it from the start. I saw my father, uncles, older cousins as role models and I always nursed a desire to become a doctor. I would as a child write a long list of medical degrees under my name and be fascinated with how it looked.High SchoolI was a strange kettle of fish at school. I was an extremely curious kind and my favourite subjects were mathematics and computer science. I guess I loved these more than others since I did not have to commit huge loads of information to be vomitted into an exam paper. I was always reading stuff. I loved English Literature. Right through high school i read a lot of books from Kipling, Ruskin Bond, Agatha Christie, TS Eliot, PG Wodehouse, Charles Dickens, Alexandre Dumas, Robert Louis Stevenson, etc (None of it was ever asked in the exam). I took a fancy to poetry and was inspired by Robert Frost, Kipling, Milton, Alfred Lord Tennyson. I started writing my own poems (they were quite juvenile and silly at the time). I loved science too. I excelled in Chemistry and Physics. I was pretty good in Biology. I really had a wide range of interests. I did poorly in History, Geography and Kannada (not proud of not being good at Kannada and I still regret not trying harder). In high school I was so fascinated with mathematics and english literature I could only see myself becoming either mathematician or a writer/professor in English. Then fate happened. School results came in. I did very well and like I was expected to I went into the science stream in a prestigious junior college. The peer pressure at that time dictated that all the top students would go into Engineering. All my friends started talking about getting into the IITs and how getting into one made your life. You would never have to think about money for the rest of your life if you are from IIT. I realize now that they way oversold that dream but I was hooked. Who doesn't want the possibility of your life set at the age of 22?I started preparing for IIT-JEE. I worked hard for two full years. I sacrificedtwo years of college social life to attain that incredible dream,but I still came up short. When I realised that dream wouldn't realize I put my energies towards getting into Regional engineering colleges (NITs were called RECs then). But fate had other ideas. Yes i did manage to get a good engineering rank to secure a Mechanical engineering seat in a NIT, Warangal and i would have gone on to be an engineer if I had decided to. But along with my engineering  rank quite unexpectedly i secured an excellent medical rank purely based on my excellent physics and chemistry performance ( As I had not invested much energy on Biology I didn't smash the charts). At that point of time I was truly confused and I cannot deny that there was some invisible familial pressure to take up medicine. Nothing was ever said but a lot of conversations implied a subtle form of pressure. As an 18 year old you hardly have everything sorted ( at least I wasn't). I took up Medicine thinking anyway that was what I always wanted to do.Well that decision did haunt me several times in my medical career. Medical schoolI started medical school at JSS Medical College, Mysore. Once I started my medical school I never quite fit in. I dropped from the top of my class in high school to somewhere in the middle. I did study a lot in first year and was just about hovering on average. I cleared my first year with fairly decent marks but I had put way too much work to pass an exam than I had in my whole life. In second year, somehow a switch seemed to have switched off. I took to sports- Football and long distance running was all I did most of my 2nd year of medical school. I did enough to pass all my exams and fortunately I was still in the middle of the class at the end of medical school.

They had state of the art equipments and excellent teachers who fueled my dreams. I was especially interested in Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery and my mentors in RIO-K encouraged me towards it. I did quite well in my residency and was among the top residents when I completed my residency.FellowshipsThis was again quite a struggle. I did a Research Fellowship in Ophthalmic Plastics and Ocular Oncology in LV Prasad Eye Institute, Hyderabad. I wasn't accepted into their Clinical Fellowship program since there was a lot of competition and there was only one slot.Due to paucity of good clinical fellowships in Ophthalmic Plastics in India I finally took up a Clinical Fellowship in Cornea and Refractive surgery at Narayana Netralaya, Bangalore.By the time I finished this Fellowship I was accepted into a Clinical Fellowship program in Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery and Ocular Oncology from National University Hospital, Singapore. It was a dream come true. Ophthalmic Plastics is my first love so I went ahead and accepted it. This fellowship is among the best in the world for this sub-specialty. At this point in time I was fully committed to the medical career. My experience during my fellowship was among the best in my entire medical career. I trained under a very famous surgeon who in turn turned out to be an excellent mentor. I did well both in surgical training and academically. I presented my scientic research papers in many international conferences and was appreciated for my work in NUH, Singapore. I got to work with some of the most accomplished doctors in the world doing cutting edge surgeries. I shared an excellent rapport with my colleagues in Singapore.I have returned back to Bangalore, my hometown and I am now a consultant in Orbit, Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery and Ocular Oncology. That is my journey from a clueless high school student to a Sub-specialist Doctor. It certainly hasn't been an easy journey. I have struggled quite a bit to get through so many hurdles. I certainly have had my family support me all along the way. It would never have been possible without their constant support.I have often been disillusioned at how the society treats doctors- underpaid, maligned by media and public, beaten up for no fault of theirs. All these incedents saddens me no end but if you ask me I cannot see myself being anything else. A medical career demands a lot from your side- physical, mental, financial & social stress. A lot depends on how you handle this constant stress. Luck also plays an enormous factor (more than you think). Not every brilliant student goes on to become a great doctor but sometimes average and below average students go on to have very successful medical careers.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm no fan of formal education. I have time and again spoken against a lot of things that is wrong about formal education. Despite the proponents of informal education such as home schooling and self-learning, if it were my kid, I would still give my child some form of formal education. Surprised at the contradiction?I often come across memes and forwards/T-shirts saying ""I was born Intelligent,  Education ruined me"" I do sometimes feel pangs on guilt of not being that rebel I always wanted to be.Vivek Nagarajan gives an excellent answer to address the self learning part and he proves why formal education sometimes sucks and he is absolutely right in whatever he says. Things worked out for him much better than a lot of people without formal education. But that doesn't mean it is the best solution for your kid. (he acknowledges as much in his answer)I'll tell you why!Children forgetYou may have the best interests at heart but your children when they are 25 may not appreciate your view of the world.  Everyone should aspire to be as lucky as Charles Tips to have his children turn out to such successes (for context: Charles Tips' answer to What are good ways to prepare my kids to become billionaires?). Sometimes, we are not as lucky as Charles or Vivek.Indian ContextI'm sorry to say, at least in India, a degree gives you a better life than most. The value of education that you get from that degree may vary but that rubber stamp of a degree can get you to cross many hurdles in the Indian job market. You don't want to deprive you child of those lowest common denominators. Your child may be exceptional but you cannot really tell whether your child will be a success by not going to school. In a population of more than a billion, one would be lost without even a degree.Some professional options will be restricted for your kidIf you opt for no schooling for your kid, your kid maybe educated but some options will remain permanently closed to your child. One cannot become a Doctor/ Lawyer/ Professional Accountant and the other multitude of professions requiring licences to practice the trade. Social AspectMany of my closest friends were made in the course of a formal education. School teaches us a lot of things- Unfairness, bullying, cruelty, friendship, mentorship, respect for other's opinions, gratefulness, sacrifice, team work, sportsmanship, the sense of wonder, etc. It is for these lessons in life that were taught in school that I go to my annual Old student's day every September. I'm very fortunate that I went to such a great school.  Your personal struggleWhen you dump formal education, the onus of educating your child will fall completely on you. We all like to believe one will always do the best for our child but educating our child with our own worldview is awfully restrictive. Many children may not be as resourceful as Vivek was during his childhood.The difficult choicesThe choice of no schooling or home-schooling is one that you may regret in future and wont have an opportunity to go back and undo it. This is often the dilemma that one goes through when you have to decide for somebody else's future instead of your own. You may choose something for your child but your child may not agree with your choices when they are adults. All they'll see is that you deprived them of a school experience and now if they do not have skills to acquire a job they will blame you for their present condition.Why formal education is still important and one way forwardFormal education is still low-risk, however cliché it sounds. It is still one of the best things you could give a child- yours or not. I feel we don't need to throw away formal education just yet. We need to stimulate the minds of our children in more ways that what a usual school does. This takes way more effort that just criticizing our existing systems. What is often required is personal parental involvement in educating your child in the things the school does not and yet give your child ample opportunity to discover things by themselves. Children are sponges at learning things if they want to. They will eventually find the right teachers- formal education or not.PS: I do not have kids yet but I doubt my position would change if I did.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"This is very broad topic and a covers a lot of it technical knowledgeI will deal with it in as simple terms as possible. You can read more about intricate details of it if you are interested from the linksAvastin  is a trade name for BevacizumabBevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A).  VEGF-A is a chemical signal that stimulates angiogenesis in a variety of diseases, especially in cancer. Bevacizumab was the first clinically available angiogenesis inhibitor in the United States.It is as stated above an Angiogenesis inhibitor originally conceived as a treatment of colerectal cancer. But it's anti- angiogenesis properties can be used in various other diseases. It's use in the eye is Off-label use. For abnormal blood vessels to grow in your eye, they need a chemical called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. Avastin® blocks the production of VEGF, thus slowing the growth of blood vessels in the eye that can leak and cause vision loss. The drugs that block the trouble-causing VEGF are called anti-VEGF drugs.Hence Avastin is an Anti-VEGF drug used in various angiogenic diseases of the eye such as Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) with Chroidal Neovascularisation Membrane (CNVM) Diabetic Retinopathy with diabetic macular oedema (DME)Proliferative Diabetic retinopathyMacular edema associated with retinal vein occlusionHowever USFDA only allows Avastin injections into the eye if it informed to the patient that it is off labelAvastin was initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for different types of cancer. Its use to treat eye disease is considered an “off-label” use. The FDA allows the use of drugs for conditions other than those for which it is approved if doctors are well informed about the product and proof has been shown of the drug’s positive effectsThere are newer human monoclonal anti-VEGF agents called Ranibizumab (trade names- Lucentis, Accentrix) and Aflibercept (Eyelea) which are USFDA approved for eye diseases listed above. But clinical trials are yet to establish any of the three agents- Avastin, Lucentis, Eyelea- are superior to each other.The main factor in usage at least in India is dependent on cost and whether the patient is insured for using an FDA approved drug.Lucentis and Eyelea costs about $2000/ dose while Avastin costs $50 in US.In IndiaAvastin costs about Rs. 10-15k / dose Lucentis/Accentrix/Eyelea costs about Rs. 25-30k/ dose OZURDEX® is a totally different drug. The active drug is Triamcinolone Acetonide.Triamcinolone Acetonide is a long acting steroid which is available in injection form (Kenalog or Kenakort) and also as a slow- release depot preparation (Ozurdex)The indications are similar but the side effects are more in an intravitreal steroid when compared to an intravitreal anti-VEGF. the biggest complication of Intravitreal Triamsolone is steroid-induced Glaucoma. It doesnt happen in everyone but an extra risk nonetheless.The injection form is cheaper than the depot preparation.In India  (depending on the place /hospital/doctor)Injection (Kenalog/Kenacort) costs about Rs. 2-5k/doseDepot (Ozurdex) costs about Rs. 25-30k/dose.Which is the best for you?It depends on the indications for which it will be used for and evidence based medicine. For macular oedema  doctors usually prefer Orzudex over Anti-VEGF agents. For neo-vascular conditions they prefer Anti-VEGF agents. Ozurdex is one of the favorites for the treatment of Uveitis.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"According to the code of ethics that Indian doctors have to adhere to , a doctor has to right to choose his/her patient and the patient has the right to choose his/her doctor. The same code of ethics dictate that a doctor is obligated to treat a patient in situations of emergency when he has all the tools to save the patient's life.I'll give you two contrasting personal examples to drive home the point.The first one- I was travelling in a night bus to about a month back (Bangalore-Pune) and then suddenly one of my fellow passenger started developing chest pains. The bus was in the middle of nowhere and I was as helpless as anybody else on the bus to help that man. So I kept quiet, searched for the nearest hospital on my phone and helped get that man the appropriate care needed. If I had revealed that I was a doctor, several in the bus would have jumped on me to treat him right there wasting valuable time that would have been best utilized to get that man to a hospital.The second example was during my residency and I was travelling from Kolkata to Bangalore on vacation by flight. Mid-air the passenger behind me had a severe asthmatic attack. I told the crew member to get me the emergency medical kit which I knew would be available in every plane. I took charge of the situation and gave him an injection of hydrocortisone after which he improved dramatically and we could continue on the journey without a problem.So you can see the difference between the two situations. My reaction as a doctor was different in both cases but in both cases the patient got the fastest possible care. Most doctors want to help when they can but it would be unreasonable and unfair to pin the blame for an emergency medical situation which cannot be taken care of on the doctor.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm the OP here. This question was prompted by a comment on another answer where the Quora user argued for legalized and regulated organ trade.  Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Why don't more people sign up to be organ donors?The world is still debating Organ donation Vs Organ trade. Personally I am against commercialization of organs in India or in any other country. But I wanted to know the opinions of other people since I do not want to be closed about it. If there is a solution to this complex problem we should not be short sighted about itThe objections which I believe are valid from my perspective are the following:1. No matter the price offered, most of the money lands up with the middle-men and is inevitable despite government control of the highest kind. The actual donors end up with a minuscule amount of the whole business.2. Money changes everything. There is already a debate on the definition of end of life and brain death. When money is factored in there will be an unethical tilt in the debate as to when to end 'end of life care' and begin 'organ harvesting'. Legalization or organ trade risks making the establishment and families go more in favour of stopping the end of life care when there is a monetary incentive to end life.3. Let's face it that organs are donated for money usually by the poor since they are in poverty and would do anything to come out of it. The studies by WHO indicate that after donation health and economy of the donors are poor especially in countries like Iran, Egypt, etc. 4. When legal, organs and tissue banks will start modeling their business strategies to maximize revenues. Even so called 'altruistic' clinics will not have sufficient income to ensure that the best tissues reach people in need.5. Organ trade will ensure that only the rich will get organs at the expense of poor/dying patients. This is both exploitative and against the Universal declaration of human rights- Organ trade is coercion in the form of monetary gain.6. If Legalisation of organ trade were such an ideal model why are even the most developed countries with strict law enforcement still hesitant to legalize organ trade. It might have to do with present realities like this.​​You know where this is going? When the rich countries make organ trade legal....The Black market organ trade present today will become a legalized Red market. The above info-graphic will only increase and rich countries will keep buying organs from poor countries. Everyone knows how dollars impact human rights in underdeveloped and developing economies.7. Some countries that have skirted with Organ trade Vs Organ Donation problem as follows:France and USA have brought in a presumed consent law for organ donation with an opt out clause. This looks promising as the organ donation has increased 25-30% since the law was enforced.China and Russia have a history of harvesting organs from imprisoned and executed criminals. China has since banned organ commercialism in 2007.Philippines banned organ trade in 2008. It was a hub of medical transplant tourism till then.India had an open market for organ trade till Human Transplantation Act 1994 brought an end to this racket. The poor often did not even know their kidney was taken and it blew into a huge controversy and the government had to ban organ trade.Australia and Singapore are considering legal organ trade legislation but it is still in development.Iran is the only country in the world which has legalized organ trade. But they have certain rules that govern organ donation and cannot involve people out of the country. Whether legalization of organ trade in Iran is working is definitely debatable. This is how it is working out in Iran:Kidneys for sale: poor Iranians compete to sell their organshttp://www.theguardian.com/world...To be or not to be: An insight into the legality of organ trade in Iranhttp://www.yourmiddleeast.com/cu...",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I wish I had that hack to become a successful doctor. I would have written a book on it and made it a best-seller. :-)On a serious note, I can only give some pointers.1. The learning never ends for a doctorYour brother is just finishing MBBS. It would be at least about 10 years more before he even starts practicing on his own unless he wants to be a general practitioner. Whatever be his future plans, there is no end to learning. The medical field is changing at exponential pace. If he is not abreast with the latest he is at the risk of being mediocre. Mediocre doctors don't make successful doctors. So he has to constantly learn new things, adapt, learn new skills when required and be humble enough to know that he needs to do it.2. To plan well ahead, find good role models and mentorsIn India, it is extremely hard to get a good mentor and teacher so I would suggest he use his internship wisely. you can read more about it here:Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to How do I make best use of internship during MBBS in india?3. Know the limitationsMedical science has progressed a lot but we still cannot cure everybody and please every patient. When we enter this profession we always think that if we work hard, take the right decisions and do work in the patient's best interests, we will become fine doctors. But slowly we realize that even at your best, you may lose a patient to disease or a patient may be angry at you even with excellent results. It doesn't mean we don't try our best but we have to understand that sometimes even our best may not be enough.4. Make friends and never talk ill of another doctorThis is a very important part of a medical practice. We need friends to look out for us. Every 11th doctor in India has at least one malpractice suit against him. So a doctor should be extra careful not to make enemies among his own kind since other doctors will be the ones who will pass judgement when the time comes. Having friends in your profession is invaluable in your professional and personal life. Never underestimate that. So never talk ill of any doctor or their management with a patient or even another doctor. You can have disagreements and tell the doctor concerned but never humiliate anyone in the public sphere.5. Never make decisions based solely on moneyWhen you do so, the decisions you take are almost always wrong. Unlike other professions, money does not mean success in medicine. Good and successful doctors always place patients at the center of their care but unfortunately I do have to admit a lot of doctors don't.6. Doctor- Patient relationshipsTo a doctor who is just starting out I would say this:  Your decisions will be questioned at every step. You cannot dismiss patients like you are doing a favor to them. You will have to get down to the level of the patient and sometimes lower. It will be a big let down in a new doctor's life that they keep having their motives questioned every day of their professional lives. I think this is for the better as the doctor community has been too arrogant for far too long. They spend so little time with patients giving the excuse of long patient lists and surgeries. I think this is why people are so distrusting of what we do. Doctors of the new era have to respect the ""new patient"" who is educated, informed and has 1000 questions. There will be unreasonable patients just like other professionals have unreasonable clients. You have to approach it like how other professionals do. Any drug that you prescribe you should know all the side effects. Any surgery that you do you should know all possible complications. Ignorance is never an excuse anymore. It is your job to know. Never be dogmatic and steadfast about your decisions or opinions. Learn humility, patients appreciate that. State your professional opinion clearly before educating your patient about his/her disease and give them more than one choice when possible. Let patients take ownership of the decisions that need to be taken. All this takes time and you would be well advised to give it to them in the first instance or you'll be forced to give it in court. This sword of Damocles hanging over your head seems very unfair when all you wanted to do was do your job well. There is no point complaining about it and we have to make peace with our present day realities. If we want to be counted as professionals we have to be accountable. 7. Connect with patientsDoctors need to connect to every patient they meet. For you will have several patients but for a patient you are the only doctor at that point of time. Learn more about your patients and make them feel like you are their doctor rather than make them feel they are your patients. There is a world of a difference in that.Additional resources:I would recommend every medical graduate use the following resources - print and other media before embarking on a life of medicine.1. 5 rules of practicing medicine by Atul Gawande -Page on wordpress.com2.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Its makes an excellent metaphor to explain what doctors do as a correlation to a mechanic but I'm afraid it doesn't quite explain everything.The problem with comparing a mechanic with a doctor is one of objectivity. You can objectively analyze a car mechanic's work and probably give valid statistics for how effective he is. You can't do the same with doctors. Doctors have to manage the ""car"" without ""spare parts"" a mechanic has. He can ""oil"" the ""car"" or repair the ""parts"" but replacing the ""parts"" can only be done with limited success.Also often in the bid to objectivise a doctor's work mainly for the benefit of insurance companies and corporate hospitals one often forgets that a doctor-patient relationship is a human-human interaction. This is a sacred relationship that is not accomplished when you have a robot with a doctor's knowledge and surgical skills. Medicine is an art and diagnosis is not the sum of all answers to questions asked. It is often the product of human to human interaction. So I do not think a machine will ever replace a doctor while a machine may very well replace a mechanic in the near future.Disclaimer: this answer is not meant as an offense against mechanics. I have immense respect for mechanics since I love cars. But comparing doctors to mechanics is unfair to both professions.Thanks for the A2A Saifullah Khan",high,high,high,low,low

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I feel Plastic surgery is being used synonymous with cosmetic or aesthetic surgery. While aesthetic surgery is the most profitable part of Plastic surgery, it is just a subset of total number of Plastic surgeries done worldwide. I would hazard to guess that only 10% of plastic surgeries are cosmetic in nature globally. Rest of them have actual medical indications for it. I also see that Plastic Surgery has a negative connotation in the general public and even on Quora. I've had quite a lot of people on Quora telling me things like: ""There's nothing honorable about plastic surgery, don't pride yourself over it""That is rather unfortunate behavior because aesthetic surgery accounts for a very small part of my practice. I treat patients who have real medical problems like cancer, infection, facial fractures, functional deficits, etc. The right to look like a normal person who has had some part of his body removed/injured due to cancer/ trauma/ infection / senility is just as important as a heart surgery or cataract surgery.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"This is an eyelid surgery which is often mistaken as Cosmetic surgery but it does not always have to be so. It can also have medical indications. In the following paragraphs I shall try to give as much information as possible and dispel common myths about the procedure.WHAT CAN CAUSE THE NEED FOR THIS EYELID SURGERY?With age skin and muscles of the eyelid can sag and droop. In addition the fat that surrounds the eye may bulge through the skin of the upper and lower eyelids. Excess skin, muscles and fat can weigh down the eyelids and can sometimes block your vision. This can lead to fatigue, eye strain, skin irritation and loss of peripheral vision. Excess skin, muscle and fat can create what many feel is an unattractive aged appearance especially in the lower eyelids (eye bags or bags under the eyes)Something like this:WHAT IS BLEPHAROPLASTY?Blepharoplasty is the removal and repositioning of the skin, muscle and fat of the upper and/or lower eyelid. In the upper eyelid the incision is made and hidden in the natural lid crease. In the lower eyelid the incision is made along the skin just beneath the eyelashes or in the moist surface of the eyelid known as conjunctiva. HOW WILL EYELID SURGERY AFFECT MY VISION AND APPEARANCE?The results of the Blepharoplasty depend upon each patient’s symptoms, unique anatomy, appearance goals and ability to adapt to changes. Blepharoplasty only corrects vision loss due to excess skin, muscle and fat that blocks the eye. By removing this excess skin, muscle and fat that blocks the eye, the Blepharoplasty of the upper eyelid  may allow for more air to get in and improve peripheral vision. Blepharoplasty does not improve blurred vision caused by problems inside the eye or by neurological disease behind the eye.Because excess skin, muscle and fat are consequences of aging, most patients feel that blepharoplasty improves their appearance and makes them feel more youthful. Some patients, however, have unrealistic expectations about how changes in appearance will impact their lives. Carefully evaluate your goals and your ability to deal with changes to your appearance before agreeing to this surgery.WHAT ARE THE MAJOR RISKS?Risks of Blepharoplasty include but are not limited to: bleeding, infection, an asymmetric or unbalanced appearance, scarring, difficulty closing the eyes (which may cause damage to the underlying corneal surface), double vision, tearing or dry eye problems, inability to wear contact lenses, numbness and/or tingling near the eye or on the face, and in rare cases, loss of vision. You may need additional treatment or surgery to treat these complications; the cost of additional treatment or surgery in NOT included in the fee for this surgery. Due to individual differences in anatomy, response to surgery, and wound healing, no guarantees can be made as to your final result. For some patients, changes in appearance may lead to anger, anxiety, depression, or other emotional reactions. The listing of these complications do not imply that these are common occurrences but only to emphasize that risks are a part of any surgery.  WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES?You may be willing to live with the symptoms and appearance of extra skin, muscle and fat around your eyes and decide not to have surgery on your lids at this time. In some cases the appearance of excess skin and fat in the lower lids can be improved with skin resurfacing (using lasers, dermabrasion, or chemical peels) and/or injectable fillers. WHAT TYPE OF ANESTHESIA IS USED? WHAT ARE ITS MAJOR RISKS?There are some risks of anesthesia- general or local.Complications of anesthesia injections around the eye may include: perforation of eyeball, injury to the optic nerve resulting in loss of vision loss hemorrhage, retinal detachment, interference with retinal circulation resulting in possible vision loss, drooping of the upper eyelid, hypertension or lowering of blood pressure and respiratory depression.General anaesthesia can result in heart and breathing problems, and in very unusual and rare instances, death or diminished brain function can occur.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Laszlo B Tamas has given an excellent answer. My answer is more of a comment and general addendumThe attitude today is shoot your doctor for anything bad that happens to you. Whether it is because of the natural history of the disease, non compliance of medications, internet diagnosis or self medications is of no relevance whatsoever. I agree there are some mistakes from doctors but I often see they are few and far in between. In all this they forget that doctors are humans too and that they can't be perfect like a robot. The other aspect regarding patients distrusting residents and interns I have experienced such patients right though my residency and fellowship. I often find that such patients get inferior and slower care than a patient who trusts the doctor attending to him first. There are two reasons for this:1. Consultants and senior doctors are pressed for time than a resident2. By distrusting the resident caring for you, you have lowered his morale and he's no more working fully on your side. While the patient who trusts his resident he's getting better already. The resident is on the ball and mostly on top of things than most of the senior staff.If you want your doctor to wholeheartedly fight for you. Trust him.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Actually many Ophthalmologists do. I know at least about 10 Ophthalmologists at the top of my head who have undergone LASIK. It is one of the safest surgeries in Ophthalmology. Many Refractive surgeon colleagues of mine have got it done.Why an Ophthalmologist would not go for LASIK could be due to one or more of the following reasons1. It is a cosmetic surgery for the eye. LASIK just carves your cornea with your glass power. A Myopic stays a Myopic for life.2. LASIK can cause dry eyes invariably. Not many Ophthalmologists like to keep putting drops into their eyes religiously for a few months after surgery. 3. Some doctors like glasses. They like how glasses look on them. Some people appear more dignified and intelligent with glasses. For a doctor that might be beneficial.4. Some Ophthalmologists may not be fit for LASIK- their corneas may be thin, etc5. Cost- Yes it is expensive even for the doctor unless he owns the machine himself. Cost of a good quality LASIK machine is about $1 Million plus consumables like blades and cartridges. Glasses and contact lenses are so much cheaper.6. Fear of surgery- this is a very small reason. A few surgeons are phobic getting operated on though they might be doing surgery on others everyday. 7. No surgery has 0% complications. The fact that they have personally seen some very bad complications makes them risk averse regarding their own eyes. The risk of complications maybe 0.01% of all surgeries together. Statistics means nothing if something goes wrong in their own eyes. Once an Ophthalmologist's eyesight is compromised it could mean the end of his/her career. Taking even such a risk- however small- for a cosmetic surgery (to get rid of glasses) may not seem to score high in their cost-benefit ratio.Thanks for the A2A Preeti Suman",high,high,high,low,low

It is seen mostly in males and rarely in females. It is maternally inherited and usually seen in the male line of the family.Colour Blindness does not mean actual blindness but impairment of colour vision. The impairment is usually part of a spectrum from high to low. It is very rare that someone would see the world in black and white so as to speak.Scientist who discovered colour blindnessIt was first described by John Dalton, an English chemist and physicist in 1798. John Dalton was a chemist, physicist and meteorologist. He was instrumental in pioneering the modern atomic theory and also did pioneering work in colour blindness. He basically discovered his own colour blindness hence it was known as Daltonism for sometime but today it is only referred to one kind of colour blindness- Deuternopia.Why it occurs?The basic pathophysiology is that the genes that code for retinal cones that percieve colour are at fault. The types retinal cones usually correspond to the three primary colours Red, Blue and Green. Deficiency of any of these types can give rise to one of three forms of colour blindness-ProtanomalyDeuteranomalyTritanomalyAchromatopsia - extremely rare if ever.

Innovation in drugs are happening even as we speak. New drugs are being discovered and older drugs are being improved upon to make it better. Medical research in allopathy is based on evidence based medicine backed by solid basic science research and not on some primitive documents which were written by sages (however wise they were) who didn't have the present knowledge about the human body that we have. Allopathy and it's research has saved millions of life and by extension billions more in the future. The fear of profit-driven Pharma industry does not justify blind faith in an equally profit driven traditional or alternative medicine industry.Allopathy is not perfect yet but it doesn't claim itself to be so like some other forms of alternative medicine.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"""Whatever you do may seem insignificant to you, but it is most important that you do it."" - Mahatma GandhiI believe that one's mere existence is nothing short of an accomplishment. The kind of change you can bring to other people's lives by just existing is astounding to say the least. This brings us back to a primary set of questions about parents and children.Why do parents have children in the first place? Why should they even take care of them? They all like to think they are doing a good job of the most important job of their lives. A lot of parents live vicariously through their children and they internalize their children's accomplishments onto themselves. If parents only felt pride at extraordinary achievements of their children, the world would be a very unhappy place. There is no shame in being average and decent. It beats being uncultured and uncivilized any day. It takes immense effort to be decent human beings.There is an occasional parent who jumps on top of cars to announce that his kid finally learnt to sleep alone. But we can easily forgive such exuberance. You are under no obligation to share his pride.I don't have to be CEO of Google for my parents to feel proud of me.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I actually concur with Sno Jo's answer. I believe that our high population has been more of a burden than resource. We can wax eloquent at being the nation with the largest number of young people but ground realities shows that  when most of this ""young population"" in not gainfully employed nor is it getting educated- it ceases to improve the condition of the nation.Limited resources- more mouths to feed India unfortunately has limited resources and whatever resources it has has to distributed to a larger population. It seems heartless but the development opportunity slots we have in India is very limited and there are 10 people more for each slot available. If instead of a huge population we had for example say 300 million citizens like in the US, we would have far better developmental index than most countries as a result. There are people who would use Singapore as a yardstick to assess success of densely populated countries but the argument  falls flat because Singapore is a city-state where it's  land area and population was amenable to a more controlled democracy and open market economic policy aided their unprecedented success. India is the 7th largest country in the world and have been mostly Socialist in economic policy. Both countries are not comparable but certainly India can take lessons from the things that worked for Singapore.What is the way ahead?Indian governments since Independence have massively underestimated the danger of overpopulation. Sanjay Gandhi used extra-constitutional methods like using Mass uninformed sterilizations with financial incentives. It didn't really work wonders and the infamous anti-population drive seems to have died with him.What else then?EducationEducation the world over has controlled population growth to the level that many European countries have negative population growth. Education somehow makes people realize the perils of excessive population. Just higher secondary education would have a huge impact on population.Economic Reform400 million of India's population are below poverty line and more than that are uneducated. This section is dependent directly or indirectly on the welfare of the rest of the population without actively contributing much other than votes for politicians. Hence our reforms must not be based on vote bank friendly doles and subsidies but on creating more job opportunities by opening up our market and allowing rapid industrialization of our country. The growth of our country can only be fueled by less farmers and more blue and white collared workers. The ill founded fear of Retail foreign investment and land acquisition reform has to go. Socialism and Communism just won't cut it. This fear is what has got us here. If Narendra Modi delivers what he promised (Make in India initiative) then India can easily be a leader in Manufacturing.Acceptance of the problem and improvement in employment atmosphereIndians are disproportionately proud of accomplishments of Indians abroad (Sundar Pitchai, Satya Nadella, Laxmi Mittal, etc) but no one thinks twice about why they chose to go abroad in the first place. The climate for professionals and businesses to work in India is very poor and hence the educated Indians form the lion share of productive immigrants the world over except where it matters most: India.If India provides fertile ground for ideas and business without the supposedly inevitable corruption and red tape, we would have a lot more people investing in India and creating opportunities for other Indians.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"For starters, life or death of one combatant, however high ranking is unlikely to affect the outcome of a war or even a battle.  After the first world war the League of Nations after seeing widespread medical casualities of war conceptualized the concept of Medical Neutrality. This concept of Medical Neutrality was formalised after the WWII by the UN with the Geneva conventions in 1948.Medical Neutrality is concept of noninterference with medical services in times of armed conflict and civil unrest. In this the doctors should be allowed to take care of the sick and wounded, soldiers and civilians without bias towards their political affiliations, nationality, race, religion, etc. This concept is based on international human rights law, medical ethics and the Geneva conventions.This does not however mean there has been no violations of this Medical Neutrality in conflict. Violations include:Attacks on hospitalsAttacks on patientsAttacks on medical personnelAttacks on medical transportMisuse of medical facilitiesBreaches of medical ethics by medical personnelSeveral times during the Arab Spring movement, American action in Afghanistan and Iraq, civil wars in war striken African countries- Rwanda, Zaire, Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria, etc, the Medical Neutrality has been breached in some way or the other. Doctors and hospitals were attacked and many prisoners of war were tortured and killed.In principle though, medical personnel and their vehicles are never attacked during any exchange of fire between the two sides and doctors treat patients of both sides if and when they they come across patients. American Hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan treat civilians who are wounded despite knowing that some of them may be sympathizers and closet suicide bombers.So coming back to your hypothetical scenario, when a wounded soldier turns up in a medical facility, the army doctor and hospital is obligated to treat the patient irrespective of who they are and even their own government cannot tell the doctor or hospital to stop or refuse treatment. In an ideal world the question in the doctor's mind when a soldier comes in wounded is Q1: ""Can I save this guy?"" And NOTQ2: ""There's a war going on, which side is he on?""Whether it actually happens in the ground level is a different story altogether. Because humans are humans.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I'm a doctor from India so will explain how I see it in my countryTo a doctor who is just starting out I would say this: ‘ Your decisions will be questioned at every step. You cannot dismiss patients like you are doing a favor to them. You will have to get down to the level of the patient and sometimes lower’. It will be a big let down in a doctor’s life that they keep having their motives questioned every day of their professional lives. I think this is for the better as the doctor community has been too arrogant for far too long. They spend so little time with patients giving the excuse of long patient lists and surgeries. I think this is why people are so distrusting of what we do. Doctors of the new era have to respect the “new patient” who is educated, informed and has 1000 questions. There will be unreasonable patients just like other professionals have unreasonable clients. You have to approach it like how other professionals do.Any drug that you prescribe you should know all the side effects. Any surgery that you do you should know all possible complications. Ignorance is never an excuse anymore. Its your job to know. Never be dogmatic and steadfast about your decisions or opinions. Learn humility, patients appreciate that. State your professional opinion clearly before educating your patient about his/her disease and give them more than one choice when possible. Let patients take ownership of the decisions that need to be taken. All this takes time and you would be well advised to give it to them in the first instance or you’ll be forced to give it in court.This sword of Damocles hanging over your head seems very unfair when all you wanted to do was do your job well. There is no point complaining about it and we have to make peace with our present day realities. If we want to be counted as professionals we have to be accountable. Period. Also you need to connect to every patient you meet. For you will have several patients but for a patient you are the only doctor at that point of time. Learn more about your patients and make them feel like you are their doctor rather than make them feel they are your patients. There is a world of a difference in that.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Amblyopia, or “lazy eye.” It is so common that it is the reason for more vision loss in children than all other causes put together. Amblyopia is a decrease in the child’s vision that can happen even when there is no problem with the structure of the eye. The decrease in vision results when one or both eyes send a blurry image to the brain. The brain then “learns” to only see blurry with that eye, even when glasses are used. Only children can get amblyopia. Types of amblyopia1. Strabismic amblyopiaStrabismic amblyopia develops when the eyes are not straight. One eye may turn in, out, up or down. When this happens, the brain “turns off” the eye that is not straight and the vision subsequently drops in that eye.2. Deprivation amblyopiaDeprivation amblyopia develops when cataracts or similar conditions “deprive” young children’s eyes of visual experience. If not treated very early, these children can have very poor vision. Sometimes this kind of amblyopia can affect both eyes.3. Refractive amblyopiaRefractive amblyopia happens when there is a large or unequal amount of refractive error (glasses strength) in a child’s eyes. Usually the brain will “turn off” the eye that has more farsightedness or more astigmatism.Role of glassesWith amblyopia, the brain is “used to” seeing a blurry image and it cannot interpret the clear image that the glasses produce. With time, however, the brain may “re-learn” how to see and the vision may increase. Remember, glasses alone do not increase the vision all the way to 20/20, as the brain is used to seeing blurry with that eye. For that reason, the normal eye is treated (with patching or eyedrops) to make the amblyopic (weak) eye stronger.Time of treatmentEarly treatment is always best. If necessary, children with refractive errors (nearsightedness, farsightedness or astigmatism) can wear glasses or contact lenses when they are as young as one week old. Children with cataracts or other “amblyogenic” conditions are usually treated promptly in order to minimize the development of amblyopia.Vision ScreeningRecommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) over the course of childhood to detect amblyopia early enough to allow successful treatment. Pediatricians check newborns for red reflex to find congenital cataracts. Infants are checked for the ability to fix and follow and whether they have strabismus. Toddlers can have their pupillary red reflexes tested with a direct ophthalmoscope (Brückner Test) or by photo screening, or by remote auto refraction to identify refractive errors that can cause amblyopia. When children can consistently identify objects either by reading, or by matching, the acuity of each eye (with the non-tested eye patched or covered) is screened to identify amblyopia.TreatmentOne of the most important treatments of amblyopia is correcting the refractive error with consistent use of glasses and/or contact lenses. Other mainstays of amblyopia treatment are to enable as clear an image as possible (for example, by removing a cataract), and forcing the child to use the non dominant eye (via patching or eyedrops to blur the better-seeing eye).PatchingPatching should only be done if an ophthalmologist recommends it. An ophthalmologist should regularly check how the patch is affecting the child’s vision. Although it can be hard to do, patching usually works very well if started early enough and if the parents and child follow the patching instructions carefully. It is important to patch the dominant eye to allow the weak eye to get stronger.Types of patchesThe classic patch is an adhesive “Band-Aid” which is applied directly to the skin around the eye They are available in different sizes for younger and older children. For children wearing glasses, both cloth and semi-transparent stickers (Bangerter foils) may be placed over or onto the spectacles. “Pirate” patches on elastic bands are especially prone to “peeking” and are therefore only occasionally appropriate.Alternative to patchingSometimes the stronger (good) eye can be “penalized” or blurred to help the weaker eye get stronger. Blurring the vision in the good eye with drops will penalize the good eye This forces the child to use the weaker eye. Ophthalmologists use this treatment instead of patching when the amblyopia is not very bad or when a child is unable to wear the patch as recommended. For mild to moderate degrees of amblyopia, studies have shown that patching or eyedrops may be similarly effective. Your pediatric ophthalmologist will help you select what treatment regimen is best for your child.School hours patchingIn many instances, school is an excellent time to patch, taking advantage of a non parental authority figure. Patching during school hours gives the class an opportunity to learn valuable lessons about accepting differences between children. While in most instances, children may not need to modify their school activities while patching, sometimes adjustments such as sitting in the front row of the classroom will be necessary. If the patient, teacher, and classmates are educated appropriately, school patching need not be a socially stigmatizing experience. On the other hand, frequently a parental or other family figure may be more vigilant in monitoring patching than is possible in the school setting. Parents should be flexible in choosing when to schedule patching.Refusal to wear patchMany children will resist wearing a patch at first. Successful patching may require persistence and plenty of encouragement from family members, neighbors, teachers, etc. Children will often throw a temper-tantrum, but then they eventually learn not to remove the patch. Another way to help is to provide a reward to the child for keeping the patch on for the prescribed time period.SurgerySurgery on the eye muscles is a treatment for strabismus – it can straighten misaligned eyes. By itself, however, surgery does not usually or completely help the amblyopia. Surgery to make the eyes straight can only help enable the eyes to work together as a team. Children with strabismic amblyopia still need close monitoring and treatment for the amblyopia, and this treatment is usually performed before strabismus surgery is considered.Children who are born with cataracts may need surgery to take out the cataracts. After surgery, the child will usually need vision correction with glasses or contact lenses and patching.Goals of amblyopia treatmentIn all cases, the goal is the best possible vision in each eye. While not every child can be improved to 20/20, most can obtain a substantial improvement in vision. Although there are exceptions, patching does not usually work as well in children who are older than 9 years of age.Unsuccessful treatmentIn some cases, treatment for amblyopia may not succeed in substantially improving vision. It is hard to decide to stop treatment, but sometimes it is best for both the child and the family. Children who have amblyopia in one eye and good vision only in their other eye can wear safety glasses and sports goggles to protect the normal eye from injury. As long as the good eye stays healthy, these children function normally in most aspects of society",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I would compare LASIK to a cosmetic procedure for a person who can comfortably see with glasses. Sometimes when there is too much difference between the power in both eyes then it somewhat becomes a medical indication for LASIK. Also High Cylindrical power is sometimes difficult to people to adapt to despite years of having glasses. Then it may not be a cosmetic procedure. But to a person who can more or less see well with glasses or contact lenses LASIK will be cosmetic procedure.LASIK does not ""cure"" you of your refractive error it just sculpts your cornea- in effect it sculpts the lens into your cornea.That said Corneal topography would be done before doing surgery to find out if your eye is suitable for LASIK. One can go ahead if the cornea is thick enough and does not have any suspicious anomalies in the various readings.But no surgery is without risks. You would be best advised to ask your doctor to advise you regarding various risks.Some side effects would include (not an exhaustive list and also does not mean all of it will happen to everyone)1. Dry eyes- almost always 2. Irritation3. undercorrection4. overcorrection5. risk of glare at night or halos when seeing bright lights6. Regression of refractive error years after correction7. Risk of Flap related complications which is getting rarer with new technology8. risk of inflammation9.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,I beg to differ on your question's implication. I do not think there are less female surgeons in India. The dynamic is changing slowly but surely. As pursuing a medical career becomes less profitable-mentally and monetarily- less men will take it up. There are two reasons for it.1. Women are more resilient than men to absorb stress and are brilliant at multitasking which is required in surgery as well as balancing medical career and family life. Women are naturals at it.2. Men are cost-benefit oriented. Despite all the altruism associated with medicine or surgery in particular men taking up a speciality is going to be affected by profitability. The sad fact today is that it is getting very difficult to become a well trained surgeon and then actually make money from the training. Men would slowly be pushed to Radiology and Dermatology. Women have less financial pressure to make it big.In my own speciality Ophthalmology has more females than males (70:30). OBGYN I don't have to elaborate that most departments are overflowing with women. ENT too is more or less gender neutral.I do agree that there are some specialties like orthopedics and general surgery where women do not venture but that too will change in the near future. I personally know a few female orthopedic and general surgeons.Thanks for the A2A Priya Maheshwari,high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Like Caleb Krug mentioned morality and legality are two different things. It is highly immoral (in my opinion) to take kickbacks for scans and tests advised by the doctors. The patient pays for the cost price of the scan, the profit margin for the diagnostic Centre and then the hidden cost of kickback. This is unfortunate and it is quite common in India.Legality Medical Council of India (MCI) regulates Professional Conduct through the Indian Medical Council which in turn regulates through the state councils. MCI has drafted the Code of Ethics for Doctors 2002 (last updated till 2009). It states the following.http://www.mciindia.org/Rulesand...""1.8 Payment of Professional Services: The physician, engaged in the practice of medicine shall give priority to the interests of patients. The personal financial interests of a physician should not conflict with the medical interests of patients. A physician should announce his fees before rendering service and not after the operation or treatment is under way. Remuneration received for such services should be in the form and amount specifically announced to the patient at the time the service is rendered. It is unethical to enter into a contract of ""no cure no payment"". Physician rendering service on behalf of the state shall refrain from anticipating or accepting any consideration.""""6.4 Rebates and Commission:6.4.1 A physician shall not give, solicit, or receive nor shall he offer to give solicit or receive, any gift, gratuity, commission or bonus in consideration of or return for the referring, recommending or procuring of any patient for medical, surgical or other treatment. A physician shall not directly or indirectly, participate in or be a party to act of division, transference, assignment, subordination, rebating, splitting or refunding of any fee for medical, surgical or other treatment.6.4.2 Provisions of para 6.4.1 shall apply with equal force to the referring, recommending or procuring by a physician or any person, specimen or material for diagnostic purposes or other study / work. Nothing in this section, however, shall prohibit payment of salaries by a qualified physician to other duly qualified person rendering medical care under his supervision.""If one suspects a doctor taking kickbacks they have to lodge their complaint at the State medical council with evidence for the same. The state medical council will institute a preliminary enquiry followed by a preliminary hearing with the doctor. If it finds sufficient grounds for misconduct it can institute an formal inquiry committee about the misconduct. The committee will conduct a hearing and consider the evidence against the doctor. If a doctor is found guilty of misconduct they may award suspension as decided by the committee. On some occasions the committee may decide to recommend permanent removal of the name from the Indian medical registry. This is known as professional death sentence where the said doctor cannot practice medicine anymore in India. That's is how much the law covers.Unfortunately as with all laws and rules in India it is very difficult to get wrongdoers to the book. When people don't get caught, they don't get punished and are encouraged to do it.This Indian Express article gives the following statistics.http://www.newindianexpress.com/...""The Medical Council of India (MCI) has received 2,295 complaints against doctors for violating the code of ethics since 2009.During the period, the registrations of 29 doctors were temporarily suspended."" There have been instances of some doctors being punished and some quite severely but not enough to act as a deterrent. The National Health Policy 2015 which is being drafted aims to control this menance. I hope it does.That said the Pharma companies, Diagnostic centers, Machine and implant manufacturers, Hospital officials, some doctors are all in collusion to run this unholy nexus.As an individual doctor I cannot do much about it other than not indulge in the practice myself. I cannot complain about anyone without adequate proof. I don't have enough resources for acquiring the proof. I feel as long as the law of the land cannot be stringent, it would be difficult to control the problem. Doctors cannot become policemen/lawyers/politicians. Integrity is a personal virtue and you cannot force it on others. The law and it's enforcement can.Why some doctors do it?Because they are humans who belong to the same society you and I come from. A politician taking graft for giving permission to a substandard medical college or a substandard bridge is as unethical as a doctor taking kickbacks.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Well the simple answer is people don't care for someone unrelated to them to volunteer for organ donation. But really it is not that simple.One reason is superstition. For example people do not donate their eyes in the mistaken belief that when we donate a dead person's eyes that person will be born blind in their next life. These kinds of superstitious beliefs kind place even among doctors who should know better.Second would be religion. I'm  going to stick my neck out and point out that the Muslim community in India has the lowest levels of organ donation. I'm not sure why this is so but ironically they formed the biggest proportion of recipients of corneal transplants in the institute I did my residency. In some middle eastern (Gulf) countries organ donation is illegal, hence they come to India for their transplantation. People would ask me for evidence but no one in government would allow for census on such a sensitive issue in India especially when it shows Muslims in negative light. When I last checked, Muslims make 24% of India's population and that's nearly 24% who don't donate their organs.Third would be government apathy and outdated rules. The human transplantation act was done in 1994 and has seen very little change since then. There is no effort on the government's part to encourage organ donation. No incentive to establish NGOs to work on organ donation. No training of grief councellors in hospitals and no proper organ retrieval programs or established protocols.Fourth and maybe a small reason is corporate profit. Corporate hospitals cash in on this high demand for organs and have a subtle mafia running wherein the best tissues are preferentially given to private entities and they control how many good tissues are in the market.The fifth and final point which may be the most important is attitude. Most people don't want to save/improve other people's lives with donating the organs of their dead family members even if they are going to just rot or burn after death. They do not understand how tough it is to get an organ donor for ones who really need it. Only when they are in the shoes of that parent who needs a kidney for their child will they ever understand how it feels. In my experience I have seen people flatly refuse organ donation even when the diseased before his/her death had expressed desire to donate after death. Once the family refuses doctors or the government is helpless. I can understand emotions run high when a loved one dies and they may see organ donation as body mutilation but they should realize that one person's body could possibly improve the lives of many people's lives. That in itself is the greatest legacy a person can leave behind.Thanks for the A2A",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,It is not clear whether you are divorced or not.You have no rights to your wife/ex-wife's records. It belongs to her only and another person can be privy of it only if she agrees. Even if she is not in a lucid state only her legal family can approach the hospital or court for access to her records with proof of the same. Alternately if it is a custody battle you can ask the court to enforce a mental health exam on the patient from a court appointed psychiatrist. You can even direct the court to send summons to the hospital to give expert witness.There are no short cuts to this predicament. I agree it is a complicated case but patient confidentiality and patient-doctor privileged communication is protected by Indian law (lot of people including doctors are not aware of this fact). The treating doctor may even refuse to reveal the patient's condition and the court cannot take action against the doctor.Only if the court suspects mental illness results in crime or in custody battles the court may request the patient to submit to medical exam. If patient refuses then it points unfavourable to the person's defense but court cannot force medical exam.I hope an actual lawyer can shed more light on the nuances.,high,high,high,low,low

Medical school involves a lot of commitment to self study and let me tell you it is not easy at all. If you want to cover 60-70% of the available material in a year you need to commit 4-6 hrs of daily study after your regular classes. Best of students end up at around 50%. The really average will be around 30%. One may say why nobody reaches 100% ? It is impossible to know everything and retain it.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Doctors in India are the vilified lot and not for small reason due to the unrelenting attitude of the media to slam doctors at every given opportunity. Media misuse their privilege to become just the loudest voice in the room. Most of the popular channels give out gross wrong health advice, unhealthy diet fads and advertisements of dubious cures. If that was not enough we have enough doctor slamming shows like Satyamev Jayate. Shows like these invite doctors and patients to discussion forums and post recording heavily edit the discussion in a very biased fashion to suit only their pre determined point of view and to create sensationalism to increase the TRPs of their shows. Doctors are the favorite punching bags since doctors in India have no voice. They don’t form vote banks since they are an educated community which can’t be swayed by politicians. They don’t have a lobby to fight these instances of injustice since doctors in general don’t make enough money impact the finance of any political entity. The Indian Medical Association and its state counterparts sometimes have token protests against these wrongs which not surprisingly never gets reported in the media. Doctors in hospital emergency rooms get beaten up every other day almost in all instances for no fault of theirs. This almost barbaric treatment of junior doctors in hospitals across the country are never reported in the media and if reported would highlight “some mistake” on the part of the treating doctors and never anything defending the doctors. This is because in most instances these assaults on doctors are perpetuated or encouraged by media persons. And strangely if there is any instance of a doctor strike  protesting archaic quota system of medical education, low pay or assault of doctors in hospitals, the same  media will come raining down on the doctor community of holding people’s life at ransom. What I’m sad to see is that people don’t realize that doctors are not anarchists.They would be more happy treating patients rather than be in protest rallies and fight lathi charges. If they are forced to do these things one has to realize how desperate and frustrated they are with the system. Nobody else is fighting for them and doctors have no choice but to protest in what little way they can. It is sometimes heart rending to see doctors who are on hunger strikes still running emergency clinics in these protest areas since they don’t want people to suffer.Do shows like satyamev jayate show the other side of medical care?

That is why Cosmetic surgery made a huge entry in the 1950s and 1960s.Getting back to the question....Plastic Surgery can be broadly classified into Cosmetic and ReconstructiveCosmetic plastic surgery is done on normal individuals as an optional procedure to enhance already existing features, removing blemishes, hiding scars and surgically reverse the signs of ageing.Reconstructive plastic surgery is done to correct Functional deficits caused by traumatic injuries, such as facial bone fracturesCongenital abnormalities, such as cleft lip &palates; Functional abnormalities as a result of infection,disease and cancer. Reconstructive plastic surgery is usually performed to improve function, but it may be done to restore a normalcy in appearance.80-90% of Plastic Surgeries done is Reconstructive and hardly 10-20% is cosmetic. Thanks to media, celebrities, movies etc this 20% gets highlighted to the general public but Plastic Surgery has had a more noble function to serve than to boost the insecure egos of celebrities.Hope this helps clear your doubts.Additional information about Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery (my sub-speciality) if you are interestedRaghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"It is a cultural thing. Though the question description is a stereotype and does not necessarily represent all Bengalis. Movies usually love to depict stereotypes (think Deepika Padukone in Chennai Express- doesn't mean all Tamils are like her) I lived in Kolkata and travelled around West Bengal for about 3 years. I learnt their language, watched their movies, listened to their music, even went to see their plays and interacted with many Bengalis in Bengali. I did all the above on a regular basis, so I think I have a fair idea about who they are. The educated culturally rich folk - the quintessential 'badralok' have very refined taste in food, literature and movies. These aren't seen in the rest of India as much. What is unmistakable is their immense love for their language and culture. That is seen in every expression of it- Music, literature, poems, movies, art, sculptures and even their politics. Everything stems from that.Another thing I think is quite exclusive to Bengalis is that every Bengali has one special talent apart from what they do for a living. Some do take advantage of it by cashing in on that, many don't. Many Bengalis are singers, artists, musicians, poets, dancers, cooks, sculptors and other forms of talent. This hobby or talent that we see in adults has actually been encouraged since their childhood by their parents. This is where they differ culturally from the rest of India where school scores and cricket prowess has more value than cultural achievements. Bengalis are highly emotional beings and their life is centred around their family. Many households especially in Kolkata often have just one kid for the whole family to dote over. One kid per family is somewhat of a trend there. They often obscess incessantly over their kids, their education and their accomplishments. They are the equivalents of the Tiger Moms of China but in this case both parents are sort of tiger moms. All this emotional turmoil gets transferred generation after generation- again a cultural thing. This also makes them emotionally labile as well as romantic disproportionate to actual situations. Not their best trait according to me.Bengali culture is not obscessed about money and hoarding of wealth. For them personal relationships and their culture is more important. This kind of environment gives rise to the kind of stereotypes they form with people of other cultures. This also makes them very careful about money matters. You don't see them flaunt their wealth like in a lot of other cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore etc. The middle class too often come across as a miserly lot and you see them haggle for the smallest stuff in the market.During my time in West Bengal, I met some of the best and sweetest people in the world. I found some great teachers, mentors and close friends who I shall cherish all my life. I have been personally rich from my experience of living with Bengalis. At the same time there are some others who I would positively call mad and crazy. The only reason they are not on medication or an asylum is because they are Bengalis in Bengal. Their society is extremely tolerant towards eccentricity and craziness.The typical Bengali is extremely difficult to do business with as he mixes personal life with his professional life. They are inseparable for him. They put emotional references into everything from food to finances.Only two Bengalis can speak with each other for more than an hour on the topic of edible fish and sweets. Another of their pet peeves.Again what I have described above need not apply to all Bengalis. So Bengalis on Quora, don't shoot me- I love you guys.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Family medicine was introduced in India as a way to be analogous with UK/US/Australia system where there is a three year residency in family medicine to practice as a GP. They also have sub-specialization in family medicine too like pediatrics, intensivist, OBGYN etc.I have the highest of respect for family physicians or general practitioners as they are often called. My father has been a family physician since 34 years.Since this is question about scope of family medicine in India I shall be very frank about it.80% of health care needs in any nation can be taken care of by the family physician.These days everyone  in India wants to be treated by the specialist since a lot of them have disposable incomes to go doctor shopping. To a lay person it might seem like the most correct thing to do and may feel that super specialist is very accomplished hence also the most capable to treat his disease. In practice however it is a huge waste of resources. The consequences of making the cardiologist treat a common cold is that the patient is wasting a cardiologist's expertise and overpaying his consultation as well.People don't realize the importance of a general practitioner or family physician in their healthcare. This would discourage new medical professionals from taking up family medicine. It is just not viable for them.The government is also a problem. They are completely ignoring the issue and like they have treated primary education, they are treating primary healthcare with the same disdain. They aren't hiring permanent staff for the primary health centres and those hired are paid salaries once in 6 months. They are forcibly making new residents serve in rural areas. This again is a huge waste of valuable resources. Orthopedic surgeons are doubling up as midwives and delivering babies in rural areas since there are no other doctors. This is quite disturbing.Family physicians are not average doctors as people would like to think. They have a different set of skills than a subspecialist. While a subspecialist is restricted to a very narrow field of medicine the FP is trained to look at the patient as a whole. More amazing diagnoses is made in a FPs chamber than a neurosurgeon's. But in the new era this important medical community is dwindling.The scope for family medicine is enormous in India but challenges are as big. It needs the right amount of enterprise to survive this top heavy culture. As technology is advancing and internet is gaining traction everywhere, one has to be on top of this positive wave. The family physician has to be at the top of his/her game and always stay updated about the latest in medical care.As for the job opportunities post MD Family Medicine it is quite good depending on how ambitious you are. In India it is easier and more profitable to set up your own clinic than to ask hospitals to give you a job. But make sure your clinic is far away from the center of the city. Practice will take time but in time it will certainly flourish. Most hospitals in India pay poorly to family physicians. But many corporates/online websites are taking over primary healthcare as well. They are either starting clinics or are buying/branding existing practices. This is where the money is and they realize it. Family physicians need to make sure they get a good deal here.Opportunities abroad are very good for family physicians. Most developed countries have recognized the importance of family physicians and are providing easier opportunities for foreign trained family medicine doctors to practice in their country. Places like Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, NZ, Gulf countries and African countries. The remuneration is excellent.Also organizations like Medicins sans Frontiers encourage family medicine doctors to join them rather than subspecialists. Good luck.Thanks for the A2A Monica Sabbithi",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"What a good way to rile up my Sunday morning! The question is stereotyping all Indian doctors into one subset. Some fairly racist answers/comments to it as well. Where do I begin.This should be a start​​​​So there...that should take care of the stereotyping and racism. What people perceive as rude is often a cultural gap. Different cultures/ethnicities/communities perceive rudeness differently. If patients don't understand those cultural differences they most often brand the doctors rude. In most cases this is just because they are not familiar with their accent or that those doctors don't engage in small talk. This is the most important reason but certainly not the only one.That said I would like to point out that a lot of doctors in India are really rude. There is no point denying that. This fact is swept under the carpet in a lot of hospitals in India.I have seen both sides of this aspect. I have worked in government, semi-private and corporate hospitals and I often see the behavior of the treating doctor has direct corellation to the ability of the patient to pay. This is across all types of establishnents.The common excuses for bad behavior in government hospitals are:Very poor patients who might also be illiterate so they don't really know their rightsLong list of patients to see/long surgical lists.Low pay of doctors in govt hospitals.Due to low educational level perceived poor behavior from patients need to be given back in kind (""this is the only language they understand"")Because patients get free treatment they need to put up with any appalling behavior the doctors/ medical students/nurses/ ward workers put them up with.All their seniors are doing it and are getting away with it. I have seen my seniors in medical school and residency behave badly in all sorts of ways. Even some consultants with a God complex in corporate hospitals behave badly when they start to believe they exist as a favor to humanity. None of the reasons are reasons enough for behaving badly with patients.Of course I need to point out another aspect of medical care in India as pointed out by another answer to this question.The terrorizing patient and relatives. I have covered this aspect here:Raghuraj S. Hegde's answer to Why are doctors hit by the relatives of dead patients?In no other country are doctors so brutally beaten up and the government does nothing to prevent it. The doctors' rude behavior is nothing compared to the terrorist behavior of such patients and their relatives. So doctors rude behavior also needs to be seen in this background.Like I said before I have seen both aspects. Patient interaction is not given importance in medical school. Most of us including myself imbibe these skills only once we are actually doctors and also from the behavior of other doctors. I've also had colleagues, seniors and professors behave in an exemplary manner with patients. Their bedside manners are to be emulated and nothing less than doctors in the most developed nations. I chose to learn from this set of people. I'm not saying I'm perfect in my behavior with patients. I have my failings. I do get pissed off at some of my patients but I never let that change my behavior or my demeanor towards my patients. My principle is that patient behavior should not dictate my treatment of him/her. As a professional I will have difficult patients but we need to handle them as other professions manage difficult clients. I treat my position as a treating doctor as a privilege and not as charity. The patient is doing us an incredible favor by choosing us for their treatment. They even pay us to do what we truly love. It is also important to establish an emotional connect with every patient you see. A doctor will have several patients but for a patient that doctor is the only doctor at that point of time. I try to learn more about my patients and often ask unscripted questions. I make them feel like I am their doctor rather than make them feel they are my patients. There is a world of a difference in that.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I tend not to look at refractive error as a disease. I look at it like a physical attribute. Like some people are tall and others are short so too is refractive error. Glasses/contact lenses just aid your eyes to see better. The only way to get rid of glasses/CL for a person with refractive error is surgery. LASIK or Implantable Collamer Lenses(if LASIK is contraindicated). The precision of these surgeries are getting very good.But that doesn't mean you have to get refractive surgery. I would compare LASIK to a cosmetic procedure for a person who can comfortably see with glasses. Sometimes when there is too much difference between the power in both eyes then it somewhat becomes a medical indication for LASIK. Also High Cylindrical power is sometimes difficult to people to adapt to despite years of having glasses. Then it may not be totally a cosmetic procedure. But to a person who can more or less see well with glasses or contact lenses LASIK will be cosmetic procedure.LASIK does not ""cure"" you of your refractive error it just sculpts your cornea- in effect it sculpts the lens into your cornea.That said Corneal topography would be done before doing surgery to find out if your eye is suitable for LASIK. One can go ahead if the cornea is thick enough and does not have any suspicious anomalies in the various readings.But no surgery is without risks. You would be best advised to ask your doctor to advise you regarding various risks.Thanks for the A2A",high,high,high,low,low

The pathophysiology of Cataracts is related to UV exposure to eyes. So professions requiring increased exposure to sunlight without adequate protection like Snow boarders, Professional skiers, Mountain climbers, Farmers, manual labourers, etc are more prone to early cataracts.TraumaTrauma to the eye causes cataracts.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I have many friends who are working as doctors in the US. Many went there to make a better living than the one they would get in India. I'm not sure all of them are happy with the way they are working. Going to US to get into residencies is both time consuming and expensive. It is a gamble in every sense of the word. So many times these guys have to make compromises. For example an aspiring surgeon may have to be happy with a pediatrics residehe wanted to continue living in US. So these guys have to make many such compromises when they go to US. They have to have plan A, B, C to Z.Back home the competition isn't that rozy either. There are 4000 government sppnsored residency slots for 150,000 MBBS graduates writing the AIPGMEE- All India Post Graduate Medical Entrance Exam. Even after you qualify from such a tough examination the training can vary from one medical college to another and residents have to slog 100-110hr weeks during their residencies coupled with poor facilities in hospitals, patient relatives beating up doctors.

But miraculously, they do!After residency they are treated very badly by the Hospitals (both government and private) and the older generation of doctors. Most don't even get good mentors to become the next generation of physicians and surgeons. Most of the Indian doctors who go to go US or UK are trying to escape from the situations that I have described above. So in the process they end up sacrificing many of their aspirations and compromise. Many among them have grand plans in US without understanding ground realities like the OP in the following question:Raghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"As of today there is no prosthetic eye which can make you see colours let alone three colours. The closest we've come to make a blind person see is the Bionic eye and it is nowhere near as perfect as a real eye.How does it work?The bionic vision system consists of a camera, attached to a pair of glasses, which transmits high-frequency radio signals to a microchip implanted in the eye. Electrodes on the implanted chip convert these signals into electrical impulses to stimulate cells in the retina that connect to the optic nerve. These impulses are then passed down along the optic nerve to the vision processing centres of the brain, where they are interpreted as an image.To benefit from this technology, patients need to have a functional visual pathway from the retina to the brain along the optic nerve, as well as some intact retinal cells. As such, the two medical conditions that this technology aims to address are retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degeneration.Even with so many years of work the Bionic Eye is more of an aid than perfect vision. It is like detecting movement in the white noise of a television set which does not have a cable connection but catches some random free radiowaves around it to project some images.We are still a fair distance away from colour vision.More Information:Page on bionicvision.org.auVisual prosthesis",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I cannot see how MBBS will offer you an assured job once you pass out. The chances of an MBBS or MSc getting a job are the same and the salary would also be comparable and maybe the post- MSc would earn better. I can understand the pressure that you are going through because of your parents. But your parents are wrong on this count. Post-MBBS the salaries are not that great, at least not in India.If you are asking this question it is clear to me that you are not interested in Medicine. Just because you are good at science doesn't mean you will become a good doctor. Many of my classmates in medical college were pushed into it by their parents. Some started to develop an interest and did well but many were not that lucky. I suppose you wouldn't want to take that risk.For being a good doctor you need commitment, patience, hard work and real willingness to do what it takes for next 10-12 years just so that you can become a doctor. You need the same for any other profession too but you can probably earn much earlier than a doctor. You should not take up medicine to get ""a job"". If you really want to go into research I would advise you to take up the IISc offer and use IISc as a springboard to do MSc or Ph.D in top research institutes in India or abroad. IISc has an excellent reputation in many countries in Europe and the US. The opportunities for scientists today are as good or even better than doctors. Doing MBBS actually restricts your research aspirations to medical related research which may or may not interest you. You may or may not have aptitude for. Pure sciences give you a broader range of subjects to choose from. Research sounds nice but it involves a lot of hard work and by no means easy.I have many friends who refused a medical seat and went into pure science streams. Today they are working in some of the top labs in the world. In summary to succeed in any field you need to be good at what you do and to be good at what you do, you should pursue things you love with passion. Good people will be rewarded no matter what. Do not fall into parental emotional blackmail and regret 6 years later at the opportunity you let go.Hope this helps. Good luck.",high,high,high,low,low

Its not that MBBS is some unachievable goal or that science is somehow superior to arts. The greatest thinkers of our generation and past have been from the arts.2. Medical field is incredibly long even for regular student. To become a specialist it takes minimum 9 years, super specialist 12 years. Now in your relative's case its another +2 years.

Some other answers have suggested Psychiatry...here one needs to understand the difference between Psychiatry, Psychology and Philosophy. They are all different. Psychiatrists are doctors with residency training in psychiatry after MBBS. Psychology is not a medical field per se. It is an allied field in mental health. Psychologists cannot treat psychiatric disorders with drugs or therapy. They are not doctors but equally important for the public.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Colour blindness affects 5% of the population and is more common in males. Degree of colour blindness varies from person to person and which colours also varies. Red-Green colour blindness is the most common type. It's almost unheard of that a person sees no colour (i.e. seeing black and white only) but it is atleast theoretically possible.As to real world problems a colour blind person judges colour based on intensity and luminance so he would have very little difficulty doing the regular day to day activities including traffic lights. People with severe degrees of colour blindness make appropriate adjustments subconciously to veer themselves through daily life.But some professions require the correct recognition of colours like scientists, pilots, certain doctors, certain type of engineers, electricians, technicians in various fields. Their job may require them to recognize colour and their own life or life of others may depend on it. One would advice these people to avoid such professions.One of my classmates from medical school discovered he was colour blind when my anatomy professor pulled him up for drawing the histology diagrams wrong. He had reversed Eosin (pink) with Hematoxillin (purple) in the diagram which rendered it an incorrect representation. But he did overcome this problem over the years and went on to become a successful doctor in the US. A career in Pathology or Anatomy would have been difficult for him.Also another piece of interesting trivia is that women have better contrast sensitivity than men and hence have a better understanding of colour than men and that explains why women have so many choices with regards to clothes than men. :-)Thanks for the A2A Quora User",high,high,high,low,low

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I don't think they discriminate against Indian people at all. I see lots of people and questions banned which have nothing Indian in them.Let me begin by something that I saw happen in Quora.A Quora user calling himself Curtis Dubois kept posting offensive and explicitly racist questions with an assumption that the white race is intellectually superior to the Black race. He did not want genuine answers but just validation for his misguided beliefs.One such question was this:IQ Testing: If it is eventually proven that the IQ gap between European Americans and African Americans is due mostly to genetics, what effect will this have on society?I wrote an answer arguing against his assumptions and giving good examples of difference in class privilege affecting progress. I did not know at that time that this guy had put in multiple questions with similar assumptions. I thought the other answers too provided a lot of knowledge regarding race and Intelligence. I was looking forward to some other answers.Soon Quora moderators removed the question and the banned that user.I protested on Rage against Quora because at that time I got angry at what I thought was a random removal and I had invested a lot of time composing my answer.Why stop a good discussion due to badly (or offensively) worded question? by Raghuraj S. Hegde on Rage against QuoraI basically asked them thisI want to raise two points to the Quora moderators.1. Please explain the reasons for locking the question so that others are educated and aware about these things.2. Despite the offensive nature of this particular question some answers were very enlightening regarding knowledge of race, intelligence and also to see how the other side of the argument thinks when they support their assertions about race. I request the moderators to reopen the question but ban the OP for his misdeeds.Tatiana Estévez graciously explained to me about this user and his questions and why Quora had adopted this policy regarding questions about race, gender and sexuality. This post doesn’t strictly adhere to the rules of this blog, but I’ll make an exception as I know some people get very annoyed when I take action against questions like this: Guidelines for using this blog. So just to clarify, I deleted this question the day before I banned the user, that’s why it wasn’t mentioned when deleting and locking the question, it hadn’t actually happened that way. In response to your questions:1. There was a reason given when deleting, you can always check this via the edit log (click on edits or type /log after the url): http://www.quora.com/log/revisio.... In this case the reason is that it is an ‘insincere/rhetorical question’. In this case the question asker was trying to give his own view of what he thinks of the IQ of African Americans and then present it as a question. The first assumption is that he thinks African Americans are less intelligent because they are African Americans, the second assumption isn’t as obvious but implied that it will then be justified to be racist or have racial biases for this reason.This kind of question asking is not permitted on Quora, there are exceptions, but we tend to apply this fairly strictly on questions about race, gender and sexuality. 2. Two years this was the philosophy of Quora Moderation as well. We pretty much tried to keep any question however upsetting, particularly when it received a lot of good answers. The problem is the questions don’t stop and they create an environment, which is hostile to people of certain groups. If someone was genuinely curious about this, a neutral way to ask this question is ‘Has there been any proven genetic influences to the intelligence of people of different ethnicities?’. Admittedly, some people would say there is still an implied assumption, but generally this question is an attempt to get a true answer.  As to this current question, it is flawed on so many levels and I feel that the very small chance we might convince someone who is ardently racist that maybe this data is flawed, is outweighed by the harm that seeing a questions like this, which basically implies this is a fact. If this was the only racist question we ever had on Quora, sure I’d let it stay, but we I’m pretty sure we’ve seen enough variants on these to last a lifetime.  Please note that there are many users on Quora that do want us to delete these questions as they feel they serve little or no value. We have had many good users reduce their usage or leave Quora in the past because of problematic questions and we’re committed to making Quora a safe environment for peopleThis made absolute sense to me and I was thankful for the explanation and totally understand why they did what they did. I didn't protest further. I also later came to know from another moderator that he was asked to mend his ways 3-4 times but persisted so he was bannedAnother time I got a question like this as an A2A from an Elderly Pakistani gentleman who wrote all kinds of assumptions in the details of the question.Gay Marriage: Constitutional; natural or man-made?I answered that too actually pulling up evidence to challenge his assumptions and probably trying to change some people's mindsets. I spent about 2 hours writing that answer.Next day the question was removed.I was angry again but understood the Quora moderators must have their reasons. I did not want the answer I wrote to go to waste so I made a blog post out of it.Clarifications about Homosexuality by Raghuraj S. Hegde on PostsThe reason I put in these stories is to show that freedom of expression does not mean that your expression won't have consequences. Our freedom of speech comes with riders. Even in a democracy ( Quora is a kind of a democracy) we need rules to keep the majority happy. We don't want offensive people spoiling the experience of the majority.I read some of the answers by all the five that you mention in your question. Except for Rohit Patnaik I hadn't read any of the others. I saw that I had previously upvoted some brilliantly researched answers of his. I agree Rohit is a very good writer whose writing style will grip you but the tone of his answers gave away too much arrogance and immaturity. Even his replies to comments are very abrasive. I wouldn't risk a comment on his answers now. (I see that I have commented on his answers). A mature and wise person will take criticism in his/her stride and be open to change their opinion if there is a reasonable explanation to do so. He does not.He keeps calling the OP stupid in many answers which is seriously not cool. I suspect the reason he was banned was that he was reported by many people (even Indian people) for the kind of diatribe that he launches into at the end of every controversial answer and also some of his answers are a little less than hate speech. Also there may be many violations with the PMs and probably he was less than polite in his explanation to the moderators. ( I can only speculate)Trilochana Raut is also very much in Rohit's mold and is not receptive to any kind of opposing view and starts personally attacking people if they don't agree with him. I wouldn't follow either of them because they are not respectful to others. I have too many rude people to interact with in my real life that I don't need more in the virtual world. I don't know much about the other three people but I suspect they too have been banned for gross policy violations in their interaction with the other users and not necessarily their answers.That said I would also like to point out that some topics are taboo on Quora and your answer is likely to be flagged if you post something that is not in line with the American point of view. Topics like Jews, anti-Israel, Hitler, Pro-palestine, LGBTQ issues, Race are all touchy topics on Quora. As highlighted in Quora User's answer I too don't find that wrong at all. It is an American website and they conform to their cultural environment. If you want to make the best use of Quora I would advise you to stay within the rules. It really wont hurt you. If you don't want to, leave the site. Simple.Early in my time on Quora I had written an account of what a Palestine doctor narrated to me about ground realities in Palestine. For the most part it seemed genuine as he did not have a reason to lie to me. I reproduced a blog post I had written a few years ago on a question. What does a regular day look like for someone living in Gaza?I started getting hate messages. I did not even say anything anti-Semitic or against Israel. Just the thought that Palestinians can be humans with real problems was too much to digest for some users. I got attacked right, left and center for my comments on other answers. But at no point in all my conversation with some of the haters did I change my behavior with them. I very politely tried to reason with them but many refused to. So I stopped interacting with them and blocked them for good when I could. I'm sure I got reported and downvoted by several people on Quora for my views but the moderators never contacted me regarding anything. So if you feel you are right you really do not have to fight anybody.Be nice to people. You always win that way.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Congratulations. RP Centre (AIIMS) is the apex institute for Ophthalmology in India. If you are getting to do Ophthalmology residency there, your career certainly received a boost even before you start residency.How much does it cost to have an Independent Ophthalmic set up in India?Investment depends on where you want to practice. A minimal set up in a small town doing only cataracts including a phacoemulsification machine along with basic clinic machines I think would cost in initial capital of around Rs. 20-30,00,000 (20-30 Lakhs)But in a city you need better machines and set up so minimum initial capital would be 50-60,00,000 (60 Lakhs)  excluding real estate which you may build/rent/lease. But what I am seeing these days it is nonviable to have an own set up at the start of your career especially in big cities in India. Ophthalmology has grown into a specialized field and the impact that you'll have as an stand alone ophthalmologist is far less. Most of them just get blown away by the corporate set ups.I think logically if you don't have money in the tune of crores it will make more sense to acquire more skills after your residency in your chosen sub-specialty in the form of fellowships or Senior Residency (SR) and after that work in an institute or corporate eye hospital to build your reputation and maybe after 10-12 yrs down the line you can think of establishing a group practice along with other ophthalmologists who practice different sub-specialties.This is what is going to be the career pattern of the new generation of Ophthalmologists passing out of residency from now on. the market forces are thus....but yes if you have about 5 crores lying useless in the bank... build a eye hospital and sit tight in the director's chair...just kidding. :-)In summary, setting up your own clinic and OT, ophthalmic microscopes, machines and instruments will be very expensive. The days of single ophthalmologist set ups in metro cities are fast coming to an end. Its nonviable....most ophthalmologists in the next decade will be working in institutions or group practices but institutional practice can be monetarily rewarding too. You can even join government service/Government Medical College or a private medical college. The next generation of Ophthalmologists need good mentors and good training.All in all ophthalmology is an amazing branch but you will not see instant success.....you'll need to commit the years.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,This was during my residency period. I did my Residency in Kolkata and Bengalis are notorious at asking questions for the sake of it. (Disclaimer: I love Bengalis and I consider myself a part Bengali at least culturally) I had done a cataract surgery for one patient and I saw him in the clinic next day. I examined him and determined that everything was going well and his postoperative state was going along expected lines. The patient then asked me several questions regarding the surgery and post op care. I answered patiently until these particular questions.Patient: Doctor can I watch TV after my cataract surgery?Me: Of course. You should. After all you are seeing much better now.Patient: Doctor should the TV screen be color or Black n white?LOL right? Well it gets better.Me: (still not laughing uncontrollably and with the straightest face possible) You should try the Black n white TV. It will give your eyes some rest.Patient: Oh no Doctor. I only have a color TV. Could I borrow yours till my eye recovers?At that point of time I couldn't control my laughter any longer and I probably ended up embarrassing the poor fellow.This encounter still cracks me up every time I remember it.,high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"From the description given by you, you may first have to be assessed  Whether you have Dermatochalasis  which needs Blepharoplasty or Whether you have Droopy eyelids which needs Ptosis correction surgery. Some people may require both proceduresWHAT IS BLEPHAROPLASTY?Blepharoplasty is the removal and repositioning of the skin, muscle and fat of the upper and/or lower eyelid. In the upper eyelid the incision is made and hidden in the natural lid crease. In the lower eyelid the incision is made along the skin just beneath the eyelashes or in the moist surface of the eyelid known as conjunctiva.WHAT IS PTOSIS or Droopy eyelids?Ptosis is a condition that occurs when one or both upper eyelids droop and the edge of the upper eyelid falls towards or over the pupil.Ptosis is usually caused by stretching or thinning of the tendon between the muscle that normally raises the eyelid and the eyelid itself. With stretching or thinning, the muscle that normally raises the eyelid has to work harder to lift it. This leads to symptoms of eyelid and forehead muscle fatigue and eyelid heaviness.WHAT ARE THE MAJOR RISKS FOR ANY EYELID SURGERY?Risks of Blepharoplasty include but are not limited to: bleeding, infection, an asymmetric or unbalanced appearance, scarring, difficulty closing the eyes (which may cause damage to the underlying corneal surface), double vision, tearing or dry eye problems, inability to wear contact lenses, numbness and/or tingling near the eye or on the face, and in rare cases, loss of vision. You may need additional treatment or surgery to treat these complications; Due to individual differences in anatomy, response to surgery, and wound healing, no guarantees can be made as to your final result. For some patients, changes in appearance may lead to anger, anxiety, depression, or other emotional reactions. The listing of these complications do not imply that these are common occurrences but only to emphasize that risks are a part of any surgery.Read more about both surgeries in the following answers.Raghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Over the years the field has grown leaps and bounds and this being the era of super specialization…..now doctors are moving on to micro specialization. It has become harder for students to keep up to the whole gamut of information which keeps changing every few years so “specialization in minutiae is inevitable” is  the new world order for doctors. I agree with this in principle but the path to specialization especially in India is difficult, unrewarding and involves a lot of factors unrelated to your capability to be a good doctor. First on the list comes low pay right from the time a medical graduate passes out. This pay never reaches the amount appropriate to his/her level of expertize all through their career unless he/she indulges in any wrong practices or his/her family owns a hospital. Second is the high cost of medical education not only monetarily but in the quality of life a medical student has to endure throughout his student life. An equally capable professional in another field is pretty much well set by the time a doctor can come out to practice and by which time the doctor has a mountain of debt and an unforgiving society. There is very little incentive for a student in India to join the medical profession unless their family owns a hospital or have unending disposable income to spend. This puts the profession beyond the reach of the middle class since there are no returns for the incredible amount of mental and financial investment required from a doctor. So is it any surprise with the quality and character of the doctors of the new era. The brightest and smartest don’t want to become doctors since it’s simply not reasonable for a middle class family to sustain a medical student. This makes way for corruption and only the people with the insane amounts of money can become doctors in the new era. Are these the kind of doctors you want to trust your lives with? Those fortunate to be bright enough enough to secure a government medical/ residency seats which they can afford are treated so shabbily by the system. They are often put up in slum like living condition in hostels with bug infested rooms, mosquitoes and the works by government colleges. They are often made to work 80-100hrs a week resulting poor nutrition and low morale. A lot of them end up sick and in extreme cases even dead. On top of that, the added danger of flash mobs assaulting the emergency doctors on call. The general feeling is the residents are often disgusted with the system and with their seniors for perpetuating this unfair system. This is how the brightest in the field are treated by the society. There are very few inspirational teachers in Medical Colleges (thankfully few are still there). Again it is related to low pay of professors in medical colleges. This low pay will prevent the best talents to become teachers/mentors for the next generations of doctors.Some links below which might give an idea of how big the problem is.Why Indian doctors fear for their livesWho takes care of doctors in BMC-run hospitals? | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I will tell you why it is the other way round in India and that has been our biggest failing in our healthcare system.These days everyone in India wants to be treated by the specialist. To a lay person it might seem like the most correct thing to do and may feel that a super specialist is very accomplished hence also the most capable to treat his disease. In practice however it is a huge waste of resources. In most patient surveys around India and the world 80% of the sickness can be treated at the primary healthcare point. The consequences of making the cardiologist treat a common cold is that the patient is wasting a cardiologist’s expertise and overpaying his consultation as well. People don’t realize the importance of a general practitioner or general physician in their healthcare. This discourages newly minted medical professionals from taking up general practice. It is just not viable for them. What is the Indian government doing about this problem?  They are completely ignoring the issue and like they have treated primary education, they are treating primary healthcare with the same disdain. They aren’t hiring permanent staff for their rural areas and those hired are paid salaries once in 6 months. They are forcibly making new residents serve in rural areas. This again is a huge waste of valuable resources. Orthopedic surgeons are doubling up as midwives and delivering babies in rural areas since there are no other doctors. How will this change our primary healthcare in anyway? GPs are not average doctors as people would like to think. They have a different set of skills than a super specialist. While a super specialist is restricted to a very narrow field of medicine the GP is trained to look at the patient as a whole. More amazing diagnoses is made in a GPs chamber than a neurosurgeon’s. But in the new era this important medical community is dwindling in India.",high,high,high,low,low

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Actually there are one too many patient experiences that could be categorised as one of the following: Memorable, weird, astonishing or overwhelming.If it has to be memorable and uplifting this one should be the one:It was sometime during the second year of my residency. A 22 yr old woman came to our hospital. She had a condition called Congenital Blepharoptosis of one eye, where one of the eyelids cannot be lifted like the other hence creating an asymmetry in her facial features. Its not a life-threatening or a significant visual handicap but it made an unsightly appearance due to which she was not getting married. Lot of hospitals had refused to operate on her saying its a cosmetic problem and was finally referred to my institute since its a govt institute and the patient was poor. I personally took up the case and worked it up and my boss as he has always done entrusted me with the operation. I operated on her and the operation was a huge success and it improved her appearance manifold. Shewas discharged and I had almost forgotten about it. Then one day about 5 months later when I was seeing patients in the clinic, that woman with her father had searched the whole hospital looking for me and finally found me in the clinic. They had come to invite me to her wedding which was fixed after the operation. This was such a humbling experience. That day I realised that no problem of the patient is small and that we have so much power to change their lives if we show empathy to their woes.This memorable experience probably pushed me towards Ophthalmic Plastic surgery which is what I practice exclusively now.The above story is one of the three stories in what I call the three miracles.I've recounted the 3 miracles here:Raghuraj S.

Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"Recognition of Indian medical degrees is a problem in Singapore. There are many Indians who have done post graduation in India and post residency experience still waiting for certification. For you to become a Resident Physician in Singapore the minimum qualification is MMed (OBG). So you would have to take their residency exams. But your clinical experience in India would not be considered equivalent to experience in Singapore. So even after clearing MMed you will still be below a Singaporean Resident. As a Resident Physician your surgical privileges are restricted and always under supervision. The Resident Physician slots were created to plug the holes in the Singaporean Health System to take care of patient loads in clinics. So you will see that all Resident physicians are foreign trained doctors from India, Bangladesh, Philippines, Indonesia etc and no local resident physicians. To become consultant the minimum qualification required officially is MMed, FAMS and unofficially also British exams like FRCS, FRCOG, etc. Also you need experience at registrar level work for a few years. Despite aquiring all qualifications that is required many Indian doctors are not elevated to consultant level jobs as that is the prerogative of the hospital. Many foreign doctors continue as Staff Registrars or Resident Physicians despite not making consultant as salaries are quite good and better than what they would get in the home countries.For your profile -MBBS, MS or DGO the options initially are:1. General Practice-easiest and most profitable route. No need for MMed but you will never make grade as OBGYN.2. Medical Officer- you may have to apply to departments of different hospitals separately-no need to do MMed but won't move up the grade unless you do your MMed.3. Resident Physician -need to clear MMed and as described above.4. Sonographer - surprisingly many OBGYN's from India are becoming sonologists in Singapore.5. Research Fellow- no need of MMed but no clinical work and you will be totally dedicated to research.6. Clinical Fellowship - depending on the speciality may last from 6months to 2 years. But this is a short term thing. They expect you to go back to your home country after the fellowship but there are doctors who try to get into one of the above roles after fellowship. I came backAmong all the options only a Resident Physician route will give you any chance of becoming a consultant and that is also not a very straight route. In summary, Singapore is not very conducive for foreign doctors to become consultants but they have several gaps in the system for which they need doctors from India, Bangladesh, Philippines, Indonesia, etc. PS: The hospitals in Singapore love American and UK doctors and they will accept them with open arms without as many restrictions as for Indian doctors. I think this has to do with the inconsistency of residency in India. There way too much difference between residency training in premier institutes like AIIMS, JIPMER, CMC Vellore, PGI and other peripheral medical colleges.",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"I first have to admit that I was for sometime in my childhood, the stereotypical flag waving, unrelenting Indian Patriot. Since then Life happened and while I still consider myself a patriot, I'm not the one that people really think of when they think of a patriot.I agree with Quora User that Patriotism is like Religion that was created as a social necessity and not truly as representive of something that exists without humanity. Despite this I do not consider patriotism ""unnecessary"" as he puts it. Here's why:Why India needs Patriotism1. The concept of a nation and patriotism towards it gives people a reason to think something beyond themselves and do something towards a collective that we are. We cannot create leaders without them feeling that they represent something. Every higher endeavor seeks acceptance from his origins. Many may deny it but it is there. If some Indians did not believe in the Indian consciousness we wouldn't have had our independence movement.2. The world is large (despite the ""small world"" theory) and India itself is large so if we stop having these nations/states/districts/cities local governance suffers because there is no accountability and there is no law of the land. We need nation states and patriotic citizens to provide the country with a contentious voice. It is all nice to say that good people don't need laws and laws are for bad ones. Just laws have no value unless implemented and accounted for by the good citizens. This is why crime rates in states like UP, Bihar, Haryana are so high and places like Kerala have low rates. Kerala wins because good patriotic citizens make sure the bad ones get punished.3. I represented my school and college in several team sports. If I did not bother about the team I played my performance would be sub-par as an athlete. This is the same sentiment that goes with our defense forces. If we did not think we represent something- an ideal, a country, a philosophy- we cannot adequately perform for them. We need people to defend our country and patriotism serves a brilliant function in this. This if of course not to belittle the sacrifices of our armed forces since independence but if not for patriotism there wouldn't be anything of India left. We would have been invaded by everyone around us.4. If we didn't have this belief in Indianness, why else would we search for other Indians in every country when we go abroad. We need that familiarity to be comfortable. People would call it ghettoization but I feel it is necessary.What patriotism does not represent (at least to me)1. Remembering and reiterating our country's pride only during cricket matches and forgetting about the country when they litter the road. Criticizing everyone else while pissing on the wall of a government office.2. False sense of pride in the culture of our country while we treat our women and children in disdain (rapes,child labour, poor schools),  moral police everything, ban stuff (meat, porn, movies, books)- all in the name of our culture and our country. 3. Believing that Indians and India can do no wrong. I find this very disturbing and I found it on Quora too. I had written an answer in praise of Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore while lamenting the socialist policies of the Congress which is preventing our progress to this day. Suddenly you have these pseudo-patriots take up cudgels for India branding me a 'star-gazing traitor' for criticizing Indian politicians while admiring a foreign counterpart. Yes that was the word used. This same thing was in full display in the Devyani Khobragade episode in US. The govt wrongly stood behind the diplomat due to public outrage back home. We can be right and wrong as anybody can in any country. Patriotism cannot be used as a shield for the wrongs done Patriotism also does not mean we do not question our leaders and make them accountable.4. Believing that every Indian achieving some great thing abroad is a shining feature on our own cap. It does India no favours if a PIO wins a Ms. America or the Louisiana (hope I spelt it right) Governor's term. I know this is not what one would expect from a patriot but I believe I'm more of a patriot than the blind flag waving type!",high,high,high,low,low
Raghuraj-S-Hegde,"A good education is assessed by its ability to elevate a person along with his social group. I do believe that learning is truly a selfish endeavor but that is when you understand how much you could achieve with learning.  People often confuse literacy with education. Literacy is just the ability to read and write with understanding. Just reading and writing isn't enough! True education makes you think. One of the biggest challenges in a country like India is get children to a school. The bigger challenge is to keep them there. I was working as an intern in a village school health program and I was really saddened by the pathetic conditions in government schools. I was left wondering in one school that none of the 800 children studying there would end up as a doctor,engineer,writer,lawyer or any profession of higher social standing.They will all end up as uneducated, sometimes illiterate day labourers, rickshaw-pullers, cobblers, construction workers, chaiwallahs etc living hand to mouth.And the girls among them will not even be so fortunate.Heaven knows if they will even reach adolescence before being subjected to child marriages, dowry deaths,trafficking, prostitution, domestic violence and also left with no chance of independent living.Education has changed the way I look at things.I have learnt to do things only when i love to do it. I have actually loved learning chemistry, mathematics, physics and literature.I didn’t study those subjects since i had to study them to get a good job or any other reason that is usually given.I wish every kid in the country would be so fortunate to experience what i have done and also feel what it is to be taught by great teachers. Education gives you the gift of independent thought and opinion. With good education we can improve social standing of people, increase the country's economy, reduce crimes and the most important thing that education can achieve is to expand the worldview of those concerned. For that we need teachers and that seems to be a dwindling population. The ones that make the cut these days are of such low quality that they wouldn't even inspire themselves. This is because education has been turned into a business that turns kids into factory products to crack entrance exams to become engineers, doctors, lawyers, etc. It sure is good business but sadly with increase in the number of private schools there hasn't been a proportional increase in good teachers. We have bad teachers even in expensive private schools. When the top of profession is lacking, the trickle down effect to government schools get even more incompetent. I doubt that in the future a person like Dr. Abdul Kalam can come out a government school system in India. Teaching in schools need to be as rewarding monetarily as working as an engineer in a software company or a doctor working in a hospital or else we will lose a significant part of our good teachers to other professions. The teachers have to be trained as rigorously as a professional course and not on loosely based criteria.They are after all shaping the future of our country. They should be licensed to teach just the way doctors and lawyers are with a regulatory body and licensure examination. The government should concentrate in building school infrastructure and teaching in primary and secondary schools and not on increasing quotas in higher education. A person who can get good school education can get higher education without the government help.But these all utopian goals and this will take immense effort personally, socially, economically and culturally on the part of governments and people in general.",high,high,high,low,low

I hugged her.Take care of yourself, study well and make your parents proud, you are the best kid i ever met. - She said.I was getting late for my school so I smiled and left.We never met again, she never came.I still misses her a lot, how her smile makes me smile.I still feel her wet lips on my forehead.She smiled, I smiled.",mid,mid,mid,low,high

Mayank-Jain-99,"""SAME-PINCH""I have the same story like youMy rank in IIT JEE was under 200 (121 to be precise.)I have never worked aboard.My all ideas and endeavors failed including one start up.Many girls had rejected me because I work in a small town in Bhilai, Chattishgarh. My financial condition is bad. I bet it is worse than yours. I live on paycheck to paycheck basis. Any thought of emergency frightens me because in case of emergency the only option for me would be to sell my wife's gold. I am depressed, sometimes I get angry for no apparent reason. It is my wife who can manage to live with me and still make me smile. I never get suicidal thoughts because of the smile of my wife, my mom and my 1 year old son is enough to bear all depression and pain.We both have achieved a rank in life and slipped. We were not able to manage our success. We have created a world of great expectations in our mind. When these expectations are not met we crush ourselves, our close ones and this world for our failure. Financial instability adds butter to this and we get into a loop of depression. When I look back, I see a series of failures to blame everyone. I curse myself for not working hard in college. I curse my mom because I believe she was the reason for the failure of my start-up (She forced me to leave my start-up.). I was not able to complete my Android App and I curse my laptop to have failed when I was about to complete the app. I have a list to go on and list of reason to curse people and be angry with them but when I closely look to all my endeavors; I find one common problem, I was not able to complete any of those endeavors  and always left them in middle and moved to some new endeavor. Now what I plan to do....Promises I made to myself.I will not hurt my loved ones by any means.I will choose one goal and achieve it. Either I will achieve it or die. This time there will be no leaving in the middle.Once I have selected my dream goal, I will not let anyone to pull me out of this, I will set all my efforts to attained this goal. I will not curse anyone for my mistakes or my failures; not even myself. These failures are inevitable but I will learn from them and make myself stronger. First I will improve my financial condition.I will listen to my heart.I will accept my current situation and redefine the world of my expectations. This new world of expectations will be as good as existing world of expectations but aligned with my current situation. For example, I do not see any chance to become a CEO of a multinational company but I can start a small company be above CEO of that company. I cannot get a job with 20 lac package but I can work part time in IIT JEE coaching to fetch same amount of money to my home.My ultimate target in life is to enjoy life. I imagine myself to work only 3 days a week to earn and next 4 days to spend time on whatever I want. It may be writing a book, traveling to many places, developing educational mobile app, working with some start-up or going for 100th honeymoon with my wife. It may be anything my heart wants, the crux is to enjoy life.I will write, help people and share my knowledge. As a first step I am writing a Quora Book: ""How to become an IITian."".Edit: I will read this answer again and again to remind myself my promises.What you can do.Make similar promises and pledge them to the heart.Your main problem is financial insecurity. Attack it first by working on weekends.Do not compare yourself to others, I know it is difficult but it can be done. Just tell your father and wife that you are the best they can get. They both can't replace you and this constant comparison is hurting you.And start enjoying life, Believe me your wife does not want more money or she does not want to settle in aboard. She is also depressed like you. I feel same for my wife because she feels most heat of my depression. When I changed my attitude towards her, it made a lot difference. Same is happening to your wife. Give her the time, love and respect she deserves and see change in her attitude.Just remember; If life gives you lemon do not think about its bitterness but think how can you make lemonade.",high,mid,mid,low,low
Mayank-Jain-99,"Have a commitment test than you should decide that you are fit for a drop or not.You have around 10 days for BITSAT. Have a 7 days test of your commitment: Test yourself and your commitment by working hard for 7 days and study for BITSAT, Leave all your hobbies, distraction, quora, social media, friends and GF/ BF for 7 days. Ensure at least 12-14 hour of study + 7-8 hour of sleep. Even if any major event like marriage of your brother  comes, ensure 10 hour of study. Start this from today it-self and no delay. If you cannot do it for 7 days what will happen in a year so before any decision test your commitment.If you fail miserably in this commitment test do not even think once about a drop and join any collage you get.Remember you need to start this from today itself.If you have passed this commitment test, After the BITSAT, continue this routine for next 2 weeks (total 21 days). In these 2 weeks, do not pressurize yourself but study for 10-12 hours and look for your inner voice. By this time you will have clear idea about your abilities, your commitment, your weakness and an idea that you can take a drop or not.Other points to check:Take a drop when you are highly motivated and want to work very hard. It should be your idea and no one has forced you.Drop only if you are sure that you have capacity to either get IIT or jump two tier in collage listing. i.e. Tier-1: IITs, Tier-2: NITs & IIITs, Tier-3: Government collage and top Private collage and Tier-4: Normal Private collage. If you do not believe in yourself. You should not drop.You should be ready to completely change your environment, leave your friends behind, change your coaching (do not go to the coaching you went in 11th and 12th).

Mayank-Jain-99,"Originally posted Here Stay Away from these mistakes:Revision is not the last day hustle or not for last one month, You need a continuous revision. What is revision ?Do not pile up backlog. Maintain your pace with coaching classes.Biggest mistake any IIT JEE aspirant can have: Keep your doubt to yourself and hesitate to ask doubts. If you do not know something, take it as an opportunity to learn and learn it from any source possible. The best way to do it by maintaining a doubt book and revisit this doubt book from time to time. Read more about doubt book at Good Learning Habits: Maintain a doubt book.Correct your aim: Never aim for the output or result. Result is out of our control. There are many out of control factors which may affect your result but you can control your efforts. Have aim to work hard, work smart and achieve work related goals. Read more at Correct Your Aim: Have an effort oriented aim not a result orientedTake a good 8 hour sleep. In any case it should not be less than 7 hours a day. Our brain works more efficiently if we have a good night sleep. Also manage your sleep time, it is better to study in day time and sleep in night. There are many scientific reasons to have a good night sleep. Read more atGood Learning Habits: Importance of Sleep in LearningNo social media of any kind. This includes Quora, Facebook, Whatsapp etc.No girlfriend/ Boy friend. If you really love her, First be a man, do something for her then only propose her. If it is just for time pass, you will have more time and more opportunity in collage.No group study but group discussion is must. Peer to Peer learning: Teach your friendsDo not try to solve very tough problems. Like Irodov, JD Lee. You can do only some selective problems of these books but these selection of questions should be done by some expert teacher. Do not solve problems posted in social media sites. Some of these problems are unsolvable and they will only kill your time.At this stage of preparation, Do not search for what are the best branch and the best colleges. Only your rank will decide your branch and college. Moreover you will have enough time for this research after your results.Choose your study material very carefully. read more at Recommended Study Material for IIT JEEI blog about IIT at Quora Book: ""How to become an IITian.""For more such posts, follow my blog.",high,mid,mid,low,low
Mayank-Jain-99,"6 year back I was in the same situation,I didn't know what I want in my life? MS or JOB or Entrepreneur. I didn't had any goal. I was very confused. Confused like you....I searched every where what I will like, what are my interest, what will be the best options for me.............. I tried to search on internet , I discussed with my friends and well wisher, I myself gave a lot of thoughts .......I looked everywhere, I searched everywhere....... I felt depressed, I felt lost but I searched even harder, what I want.... but harder I tried, harder I failed, Harder I tried to find my goal... more I became goalless..... Harder I thought ... more I become thoughtless..More options I contemplate .... more I got confused .....I tried to find best option for me, I work very hard to find best option......With all these work ... I got something ........ I got something very Ironic and unexpected...I was finding best option but I got worst ... Now I look back what I did wrong and I found....I was contemplating the ideas instead of working on them ....I was asking people or thinking about the best option to choose instead of choosing any and make it the best option..I was more in imagination than I was in reality.I was afraid to choose and fail .... I didn't choose any and automatically got the worst. The main culprits of personality was: Procrastination, Not organized, My laziness, Shekh Chilli nature etc...What I may have done I had no achievement to show after my graduation: I needed to work in any field to get quantifiable achievement.I should have worked on academics to get get decent results.I must have chose anything and tried to got it instead of planning.I must have worked on may weaknesses one by one .... I must have worked ....Suggestions for you:You are only 20..... It is the best time to be confused so please do not get depressed but you should start working.... Start working on anything.  For some time change your environment completely ...... I suggest you to use your year break .... Go for very engaging Internship or join any NGO in some other location or even go to a village to help farmers or backpack travel in many locations.  The idea is to get out of your comfort zone and experience new things.Do not try to fix any specific goal.... it will very early to fix a goal .... give life sometime and you will surely know your goal ..... just give your best in whatever you do .... Do not ever spoil your academics. I know you do not like your academics but you can at least get decent result, I do not want you to be on top, just decent. Believe me it is not very difficult to get decent result.Be expert in anyone item: Choose anyone thing, it may be programming, it may be social work, it may be quora, it may be any cultural work, it may be sport, it may teaching, it may be entrepreneurship, it may be anything but do not choose this by heart but choose by mind. Choose something where you can show some quantifiable result with minimum effort. Anything where you are good. I will give you some example of quantifiable results.Social work: Spend one summer (3 months) in a village and worked with an NGO to spread awareness about government schemes, way to have more crop production. Helped them to get government loan and increased their production by 2 folds. (Quantifiable)Programming: Deployed two android apps in android market with 1000+ downloads. (Very easy to achieve)Gaming: Developed a game and sold it to XZY company at 1,00,000 Rs.

Mayank-Jain-99,"I found this answer in this link ( possibility vs probability).Possible, probable (adj) and likely (adj & adv) all denote ""likelihood"" in meaning.However, there are some subtleties between them.First of all, ""possible"" emphases the likelihood in an objective manner,  but it always implies a sense of ""the likelihood is minimal"".For  example, I would say that while failure is possible, everything points  towards success.Next, ""probable"", according to its etymology, means verifiable, and  thereby extends to mean ""substantiated, reasonable, and credible"". In  contrast to ""possible"", it may well indicate a strong sense of  likelihood. For example: (1) It's possible, thought not probable, that he would  accept the offer. (2) The probable cause of his death has been diagnosed  as avian flu.Finally, ""likely"", on the surface of it, is similar to ""probable"". They  are sometimes interchangeable with not much difference in meaning. For example: It is likely (probable) that we shall meet with some opposition.The difference between ""likely"" and ""probable"", if you like, will be  that the former sets great store by the judement that is arrived at from  some superficial signs, whereas the latter is based on the truth that  is revealed after considering the plus side and negative side of a  situation. For example, (1) The likely outcome of the contest varies from moment to  moment(Either A or B will win as both of them are equal in strength and  skills. The outcome is unclear). (2) On the probable outcome of the  contest, opinions of the audience are unanimous(Obviously, A is stronger  than B).  Hope that helps a bit.",high,mid,mid,low,low
Mayank-Jain-99,"Sorry to say I hate these type of questions ...Why you worry about something that you do not have any control?This will ultimately harm you and I see no benefit in it.Say after a long research and wasting your precious time you came to a conclusion that you need x% marks for under 1000 rank. You will have two cases, Case 1: Just one fine day IIT or politicians decided to dilute the level of IIT exam and gave a very easy paper, Now after your research, You had a target to achieve x%.... You easily crossed this mark and over whelmed with your performance and you became over confidant and made some silly mistakes.You did not believe about your good performance, you count your response twice to confirm and waste your time that may be used to solve 1-2 more problems. This will further reduce your relative performance.You will come out of the exam with false pride and bad relative result. Your loss Case 2: You will get a relatively tough exam, exam where everyone is not able to perform as expected. It is the most probable scenario. You have a target to achieve x% but you are far behind it and you started worrying. You made a lot a lot and a lot of mistake and finally ruined your exam.Your loss again !!!This is my strong advice, never worry about how much marks you need. Just look how can you improve. How can you improve 1% a day.How can you learn at least one new problem or concept per day per subject ?How can you improve your weak area, How can you avoid silly mistake ?Instead worrying about a target marks, worry about exam strategy ?How you are going to attempt the exam ?How you can develop the exam temperament ?Some tips for exam day: During exam:Never think about the resultNever think about the rankNever count your responses (It is a must)Never go back to any question that you have marked, just move on. Not even think about it.Never give more than 5 minute to any question.If you are not able to solve a question but you believe that you can solve it. Just leave that question, solve 3-4 other questions. Then come back to question you left and again try. Never worry and if you are tensed. Just start smiling like a mad man. (not laugh, just smile). Yes !!! Smile for no reason.

Mayank-Jain-99,"One of the most memorable moment of my IIT life.My first class in IIT. As any fresher, my mind was bubbling with many questions. How tough will be the studies, How strict will be IIT professors, Who will be my batch-mates ....But the most frequent and most puzzling question was; how many and how beautiful girls will be in my class.In IIT, girls to boys ratio was very bad. In our batch of around 500 we had only about 50 girls. With this statistic we roommates discussed the possibility to have a beautiful girl in our class. With very good control over probability we easily calculated very rare chances of this favorable outcome but human mind always try to rationalize and hope for the positive outcome, no matter how impossible the outcome is.With crossed fingers, with hope for favorable outcome I started the journey for my first class in IIT. There was a clear instruction from seniors, not to use lift but use only stairs. My class was on 4th floor. We gathered near the lift and discussed should we use stairs or lift.Some of us feel that climbing 4 floors is itself a punishment and used lift and others thought it is not worth to take risk and used stairs. I was in the lazy & risky group and choose the lift.In the lift, there was a very beautiful girl; she was the most beautiful girl I have ever seen. When I saw her, I began to pray she should be in my class. With the fear that she may be a senior, I just had a few glimpse of her cute face. Both of us got out of lift on 4th floor. I got some hope. We started walking toward the classes and I was just few steps behind her. Then she entered a room. I checked the room number and it was the same room where my first class was planned. I got so excited and I was likeWow she is in my class.She is in my class.She is in my class.After controlling my excitement I entered the room. What I saw in the room I didn't believe.She was standing next to black board and taking attendance of the students. At that moment all my hopes broke down.

Mayank-Jain-99,"Here I present you a checklist all IIT JEE aspirants must follow. This will be a propwr guide for you to start.1. Maintain good sleeping habits:It is very important to take a good sleep before any exam.Revise what you were learning before going to sleep.You must take at least 7 hour sleep daily and only 15 min nap in evening.Read more at Good Learning Habits: Importance of Sleep in Learning 2. Analyze your Exams & Mock Tests (Learn from your mistake)Whenever you attempt any mock test. You analyze it on same day for mistakes and weakness. Read more at Good Learning Habits: Analyze your Exams (Learn from your mistake) 3. Prepare for revisionIIT JEE needs a long preparation. As we proceeds further in our preparation, old chapters fades away. For efficient preparation and sure success, consistent revision is necessary. For effective revision I have devised a very effective revision technique.Mark good questions for revision:Wherever you practice problems and encounter a good problem or a problem with a new concept just mark it with stars. Mark a better question with more stars.Keep in mind that you that you will revise these questions from time to time.Short notes:In this technique write only stimuli words in short. You may write:Just formula.Only name of the reaction or just reactionName if the law.Name of the concept.Visit these notes time to time and try recall everything related to those concept and revise chapters within minutes. Read more at Short Notes for Very Effective Revision Doubt book:Whenever you have any doubt or you do any mistake, write it in the doubt book. Whenever you want, re-read this doubt book.Read more at Good Learning Habits: Maintain a doubt book4. List of things NOT to do. Read more atDo not do list5. Some good learning habits:Good Learning Habits: Teach your imaginary friend. Good Learning Habits: Best way to practice problems.Good Learning Habits: Perfect time pass for IIT JEE aspirant6.  Peer to Peer learning:Peer to peer learning is a very important part of learning process and it is most effective. If you help each other, your friend may get better rank but both of you can leap thousands of ranks. It is always a better option. Today you must decide to ask for help and help anyone who will come to you. Read more at Peer to Peer learning: Teach your friends7.  Correct your aim: Never aim for the output or result. Result is out of our control. There are many out of control factors which may affect your result but you can control your efforts. Have aim to work hard, work smart and achieve work related goals.

Mayank-Jain-99,"Short Answer:Yes definitelyIf you want to perform well, you must leave all social mediaLong Answer (A must read):A student, whose future is dependent on his performance in his studies must quit Quora, facebook, whatup and all other social media.It will save your time and all other reasons you already know.But I will give a scientific reason to quit social media.Our mind always works, When we are focusing on something, our mind is working consciously and we are controlling our thoughts.Any other time, when we are not in focused mode our subconscious mind become active. So when we are relaxed, talking bath, sleeping or listening to light music our mind is still working, It is working on the concepts we feed him. It is evaluating, revising, revisiting the concepts we learned.So if you feed your mind with only studies it will work on the problems you were solving, it will revise what you have learned, it tidy up all concepts, it create linkage between different concepts and in return boost your performance. But if you feed him with studies and Quora both. Our mind loves Quora more than study. Our sub-conscious mind will think more about the Quora not studies. So one hour of quora or facebook will not only kill your one hour study time but also kill 8-10 hours our sub-conscious work.

Mayank-Jain-99,"Score of next year will depend on what you will do this year. If you will do justice to your decision and work hard, it will improve.Originally posted Here in my blog""Drop a year or not"" is one of the toughest decision for the students. This decision may raise you to the glory or may pull you back or let you wonder all your life ""What happened if I had taken the risk"".I was in same situation back in 2004.In my first attempt --- IIT JEE No selection, AIEEE-AIR 6000 and MP PET rank 79. I failed to achieved my dream to get IIT but in AIEEE and state exam, my rank was OK to land me in a decent NIT but my desire to crack IIT was still burning. Deep in my heart I knew what I want. Without second thought I took the decision. Now if you also have the same burning desire and you can do anything for it. This decision will be easy for you but before any decision have a look on my checklist and find out you are fit for a drop or not.Disclaimer: Decision to drop a year is subjective and it depends on the person. Here what I present is best of my knowledge and like all human being I may be wrong.7 days commitment test. Take this commitment test to find you are fit for a drop or not.If you take drop you need to study at least 10-12 hours a day. Find out you can do it or not.Work hard for 7 days: Test yourself and your commitment by working hard for 7 days. In those 7 days you should only study. Leave all your hobbies, distraction, quora, social media, friends and GF/ BF for 7 days. Ensure at least 12-14 hour of study + 7-8 hour of sleep. Even if any major event like marriage of your brother comes, ensure 8-10 hour of study. Start from today it-self without any delay.If you cannot do it for 7 days what will happen in a year. Before any decision test your commitment.If you fail miserably in this commitment test do not even think once about a drop and join any collage you get.Remember you need to start this from today itself.If you have passed this commitment test, continue this routine for next 2 weeks (total 21 days). In these 2 weeks, do not pressurize yourself but study for 10-12 hours and look for your inner voice. By end of this time you will have clear idea about your abilities, your commitment, your weakness and an idea that you can take a drop or not.Note: In this test, Study whatever you have learnt in last 2 years. Learn from your past:Thoroughly Analyse what went wrong in the last 2 years. What did not worked and what worked ?What mistakes you have done ?What you may have done better and where you can improve ?What you can do in next year to improve ? Make a planThoroughly analyse your JEE mains and JEE advance paper and look for scope of improvement. Prepare a better strategy to attempt the exam. read more at Analyze your Exams (Learn from your mistake)If you can see a pattern of mistakes, scope of improvement and can make a plan to not repeat your mistakes. Then you can plan to drop a year but if you still are what to study and how to study. You must think twice.Some important points:It should be your call: Take a drop when you are highly motivated and want to work very hard. It should be your idea and no one has forced you for a drop.Believe in yourself: Drop only if you are sure that you have capacity to either get IIT or jump two tier in collage listing. i.e. Tier-1: IITs, Tier-2: NITs & IIITs, Tier-3: Government collage and top Private collage and Tier-4: Normal Private collage. If you do not believe in yourself. You should not drop.Completely change yourself: You should be ready to completely change your environment, If something does not worked for 2 year it will surly not work next year. Leave your friends behind, change your coaching (do not go to the coaching you went in 11th and 12th) and change your environment completely.Stop complaining and start working: Yes you did not got the desired success but soon you will get out of the grieve the better it will be.Follow my blog for more such post Quora Book: ""How to become an IITian.""",high,mid,mid,low,low

Mayank-Jain-99,"Why do you want to get 500+ marks ?I will strongly discourage you to have a result oriented target. Instead you should only target to improve yourself. This constant improvement will help you to achieve high.""You should be your only competitor.""Moreover this is the only way to achieve high in exams ..... If you target for such result oriented target before much improvement. You will ultimately get into pressure to perform.To elaborate, I will share my story..I am very good in maths, Data interpretation and aptitude. In CAT, 99+ percentile in maths and DI was a cake walk for me.My history of CAT attempt:Year 2008: Math 99+ percentile, DI 99+, and English (-4 marks and 27 percentile, yes its a negative marks). I did not prepared for CAT and gave it just because everyone else was.Year 2009: No attempt. As I was not interested in MBAYear 2010: Suddenly I became Interested in MBA or I just started to hate my job and was ready to do anything. This time I prepared full time for 3 months. (because one fine day, I woke up and I decided to give CAT, That fine day was just about 4 months from the D day)In this time I worked only for English and just revised maths and DI. Also in exam I gave half the time English and other half to maths & DI both.My result:Maths: 95 percentile DI: 93 percentile English: 94 percentile (What a remarkable improvement) Year 2011: This time I had full one year in my hand and worked hard. I was determined to get a call from all IIMs. I was aware of my weakness (English) and strong point (Maths).So overcome my weakness in English I decided to perform exceptionally high in maths.I made a goal to perform my best and my target to get 100 percentile in maths nothing less. I thought that was my only chance to get a call.Just before the exam we need to wait about 45 minutes before the exam starts due to long process of online exam.In this time I was thinking of my target of 100%. I believed it was achievable but the apparent necessity of this 100 percentile target made me nervous ...--------------------------------------Finally I got my result ...Do you dare to guess ?I had 99+ percentile in maths, twice, without even any significant preparation.What will be my maths CAT 2011 result after one year hard preparation ?Do you dare to guess ??It was only 85 percentile in maths ......... Why did I faced such a failure ....Even I was a prodigy in maths .... I proved myself several times before but why I failed when I needed it most.Why did I failed ??Does I became dumb in maths ...I had this doubt too and only way to make sure is to give CAT 2012. This time I prepared maths precisely for one week and again 99 percentile in maths ... I was not dumb.So the questions remains .... why did I failed ?Now after a long retrospect, I know the answer .....I failed because I had the wrong target set for me ....Instead of continuous improvement ...... I set a result oriented target ....Most of the JEE aspirents do the same, they make a result oriented target instead of effort oriented. Please change your target to effort oriented.Look for continuous improvementThis is the only way to get the high result.To set your target read my this post:Correct Your Aim: Have an effort oriented aim not a result orientedFollow my blog for more such post Quora Book: ""How to become an IITian.""",high,mid,mid,low,low

They got bored with study and want to refresh themselves but same time they do not want to waste their time.Whenever I suggest any JEE aspirant what they can do with their free time I suggest they can choose any activity that is not engaging and related to study.Any activity is engaging, if that activity do not require any extra efforts to indulge in it or it keeps your brain occupied even after you have done it.Some examples of engaging activities are:Talking to girlfriend.Playing computer or mobile gamesAny kind of social networking sites like Quora, Facebook, whatsup etc. (In this regard Quora is worst than Facebook, it is more engaging)Try to make your free time activity related to study: I know you want to enjoy some time other than study but Hangout with other serious JEE aspirants.

Mayank-Jain-99,"I can easily assume, You are a good student, If that event does not happened. You would have cleared IIT with a good rank.You have everything with you, You just need to clear the dust.Now I will give you a plan:Do not stress yourself, It is very important because your health is more important than any JEE or any IIT.Study only 6 hours, not more than that. Also study in 2-2 hour intervals. 2 hour in morning then 2-3 hour rest, 2 hour in afternoon then 2-3 hour rest and finally 2 hour in evening. This 2 hours interval will make you more efficient and also during your in- between rest your sub-conscious mind will work.Study only what you have learnt in last two years. Do not learn even a single new line. Even if a new portion is added to the syllabus, Leave it. No need to attend any classes, Just self study will be enough. Now the blueprint:You must follow the all four bullets points, I mentioned above.In next two days, make charts of all formulas, facts, chemical reaction or anything that it needed to be remembered and paste it on the wall of your room.for next 14 days, revise all three subject. In full length. Yes I want a very fast full revision. It will be 4 days each subject. That mean 6*4 = 24 hours for one subject. Each subject has about 24 chapters so revise each chapter in one hour. When one hour completes move to next chapter, no matter how much you have studied. You should move to next chapter. We may come back again to this chapter. That makes 12 days. Two days are buffer.Now we have around two and half months left. Now you should give exams, analyze them and learn from your mistake. In the morning two hour give the exam. In afternoon hours. check it and in evening hour study whatever you want. Upto JEE main give old AIEE or JEE main paper and after it attempt old IIT JEE or JEE adv paper.This is all a plan and plan may extend or diminish. So if you need more time, so give more time without stress.You can have number and call me whenever you need any help.

Mayank-Jain-99,"I will strongly recommend to fill the bubble on OMR sheet after you solve each question.I do not understand. How on earth marking bubble with each question is not time efficient. Just keep the OMR sheet in a comfortable place and mark the answer as you solve it. This will be more time efficient as you do not need to read the question number and answer choice to mark. Even if it is not time efficient, How much time you will save, Say 2 second per question... What a joke ... Please do not plan your exam in that silly level of time management. There are many other ways to save more time. e.g. Read all instructions before you start your paper. You can read this before the clock will start ticking as the instructions are on the front page.Mark and notice the marking scheme and clear you strategy to attempt and guess answers. If you got stuck at some question, leave it, mark it, solve 5-6 questions and then come back to the question. There are some chances that you will quickly find the solution but if still you stuck, do not spend more time just cross the question and never come back. In any case do not spend more than 5 minute in any question the ideal time leave a question if it is taking more than 3 minutes.Take a lot of mock test and repeat this style in every mock test. After a few mock test you will feel the difference and confidant.The biggest problem in other marking style is that if by any means you mark the chain of question with wrong answers then you are out of the race.  If you feel that who will do such a silly mistake, Last year in Quora, I seen at least 5-6 questions where people did same mistake. I know someone personally who did the mistake, he has to take admission through management quota. Otherwise he have been to a decent NIT. Just to save a few minute, he killed his 2 year hard work.Do not try any other method of marking OMR:Do not mark answer at the end, it is most fatal.Do not even try in bunch of questions because even in bunch of 5 questions, if you marked them wrong you are in serious trouble.Follow for more such post Quora Book: ""How to become an IITian.""",high,mid,mid,low,low

Mayank-Jain-99,Phase difference in transformer is caused by different arrangement of its winding. First I will tell you why no phase difference in single phase transformer.You can see in diagram that both coils are magnetically coupled and any change in magnetic flux of primary will directly reflect to secondary flux. So these winding will in same phase.Now consider a three winding transformer as 3 single winding transformer; in this case all three single winding transformers will have no phase difference and we will have 6 terminals in primary and 6 terminal in secondary but in three phase transformer we need only 3 primary terminals and 3 secondary terminals; This will be achieved by connecting three terminals of these winding internally and you get only three terminals out of the transformer. These connections of winding and terminals will create phase difference in transformer.If transformer winding connection in primary and secondary are same (for example Star- Star or Delta- Delta Transformer) their is no inherent phase difference. If winding connection in primary and secondary are different then transformer create an inherent phase difference.To learn more about phase difference you need to learn about vector group.

Mayank-Jain-99,"I can give you some insight of working in PSUs (I work in SAIL and graduated from IIT Delhi).Cons:Career Growth is most frustrating in PSUs. They have time based promotion, It means it does not matter how better you are from other or how much capacity you have or how much you have done for the company; you will be promoted just after completing X years.Package: It will just enough to feed your family in a decent way. It will not be even comparable to you friends in private. (My most friends earns about 2X salary). (Edit: Initial package in PSU may look better but slow career growth in long run will hurt you financially)Work Quality: You may not get the quality work you deserve.Location: Most of the PSUs will not place you in metro. Forget you are from IIT: You are from IIT may not help you a lot in PSU environment. Some time it work against or you some time it may help.Pro:Work Life Balance: It may be the most positive aspect to join a PSU. You will get enough time for family. You will have work and work pressure but that will be confined to only working hours. In any emergency you will be with your family no matter what is happening in your company.      But a little short supply of money may hamper your big plans. If you get frustrated with your job that will also indirectly affect your personal life.Work on some parallel project: In PSUs you will get enough time to work on some other project but I will recommend to join PSU only if you have full plan and most dedication for the other project otherwise PSD environment will grab you.Disclaimer: If you or anyone think that Join a PSU and never work for your life time and get paid. This is not the present scenario. The best explanation is you get half salary and half work as compared to private.My Sincere suggestion, Please join L&T.",high,mid,mid,low,low

You must had some weakness, some unclear concepts, some fear, some pressure. First figure out these problems by a very critical and deep analysis of your last IIT JEE attempt. Take the IIT JEE paper and look at each problem ask yourself  these questions and take a note.If you got that particular problem right, Ask yourselfHow did you attempt this problem.If it was a guess, What can you learn to remove the doubt.How can you improve your performance.If you got any answer wrong, Make it as an opportunity to learn: Find the reason for the mistakeIs your concept were weak ?Have you done any silly mistake ?You had no time ?Exam pressure or any fear ?You were feeling sick ?Attack the reason for mistake and make sure you will not do this mistake again.Now you will have a list weak concepts, silly mistakes, fears. Work on these and make yourself stronger. Some relevant posts:Chapter- 1.8: How to avoid silly mistakesHow to learn physics for IIT JEE ? This is a must do exercise for all droppers.

Yes !!Had you learn anything, If I ask you 1 million such questions, Will you learn anything. The answer will be no. Yes your speed of calculation may improve but you will not learn anything new.If I will give you 10 problems. Problems which will force you to think or ask friends or open a book. Than you will definitely learn something new and improve your understanding.Practice is necessary but look for the problems you are not able to solve and take it as an opportunity to learn. This does not mean you go for very tough problems and start solving Irodov or JD Lee. You should not go outside JEE syllabus. Instead take some good book or material which is confined to JEE syllabus and solve it thoroughly. Solve each and every problem of this, If you got stuck, do nor move further without knowing answer to these questionsWhy I was not able to solve ?How to solve it ?How can I use this concept to solve other problems ?Maintain a doubt book and write all your doubts in it and visit them from time to time.

Mayank-Jain-99,"Last 7 days: Only Revision, Nothing New""Best of luck for your exam""Last one week is very crucial for the best performance in exam. In this time we must optimally use our resources, time and energy. We have very little time left and a lot to do but also we need to save our energy for the exam day. Physiological health and confidence is also very decisive for the best performance. You need to accept your current status and give your best in this time.  After considering all three parameters, time, energy and psychological health. Here I present you the best plan for the Final Week.Last week before the exam: Only Revision, Nothing NewNow only week left for the exam and it is a high time.As IIT JEE preparation is a long journey, we need to recollect and use the information that we read 2 years back. To make this information fresh in your mind, use this time to recollect whatever you learnt in last two years. Make it stronger; make its recollection faster by revision of what you know and ignoring ANYTHING new. In this last week you must do only revision,Read notes and books you already read. Your hand written notes will be best for it.Solve the questions, you have already solved. Yes!!!! No new question.  This way you will be able to solve much more number of problems and it will boost up your confidence.  One week of solving solved question will improve your performance.Avoid any mock test or sample paper. If you attempt any, make sure it is very easy exam.In short just revise what you know, make it more clear and do not read even a single new line.At this age IIT JEE may be seems to be most important battle of the life and failure in it as the life destroying event but it is not. Believe me, IIT JEE is only one small battle in the big war of life. The purpose of this is to prepare you for the war of life. It is just a platform and you will get many other platforms to launch yourself. After 20 years, it will not matter much that you cleared IIT or not but the effort you put in to achieve it, is all that matters. The learning, the discipline and the passion cannot be replaced. Zeal to get something and put in everything for it is priceless. So now believe in yourself, believe in what you have done and give the best fight. Fight until it ends.In world cup 2015 finals, After 10 over of second inning, New Zealand's loss was imminent but they did not give up until it ended. They fought till the end. New Zealand will not be remembered as looser but someone who fought well. Be that man who fought till the end, No matter what is your current level of preparation, does not think about the result or marks but give your best and fight till the end.Originally posted here: Last 7 days: Only Revision, Nothing NewNo obsession for marks, the performance is relative.Do you want to improve your rank by 10-20 % by doing nothing extra.

Mayank-Jain-99,"""If your concepts are clear you will do great in physics.""In any topic of physics you must learn:a)  Basic Law: e.g. Newton's Law, Gravitation law, Ampere's Law, Bernoulli's Equation etc. These laws are foundation stone of Physics. You must know these laws in detail. You should know application & exception of these laws and how to use these laws.b)  Derivation of the formula: In physics, many formulas are derived from Basic laws. You should not only remember the formula but also its derivation. Derivation with each step understood in details.c)  Constraint of the formula: In derivation of formula, we assume some constraints and put a boundary to application of it. If these constrains are broken we can no longer apply the formula. Most of the time, we remember the formula but forget the constraint and apply the it outside its applicable boundary. E.g. S = ut + (1/2)at2. This is valid only when acceleration is constant. If acceleration is not constant, we can no longer apply this formula.How can we solve questions, where our formula is not valid?Here is the thumb rule:If constraint is broken, do not apply the formula. Take a small part (disgustingly small dx part), apply the basic law and write a differential equation. Integrate it than put limiting condition.For more details on constrains and use of integration visit our post (Where and how we apply integration?)d)  Application: Learn the application of formula and basic laws. E.g. law of energy conservation can be used in friction-less projectile motion, pendulum, springs, when earth rotates around sun etc.Also learn where you cannot apply theses conceptsE.g. When friction is present you cannot use energy conservation in a significant way. e) Understand each and every step: Whenever you learn any solved problem or derivation; never mug up any step but understand every step. You must understand; What's the significance of this step?  How can I apply them? How can I apply them in other problems? What principle are they based on? How do they fit in with what I already know? I want you to analyze each and every step of whatever you learn. When you learn anything in physics you must ensure, you learnt;Basic LawFormulaIt's derivationConstraintsHow to use integration when constraint is brokenApplication and non-application.Understand each and every stepThese all points combined are called concepts of physics.Here is the link to blog post:In physics: Where and how we apply integration ?

Mayank-Jain-99,"Break the statement in two parts ......Part 1:Every polynomial equation f ( x ) = 0 of degree odd has at least one real root.This part talk about the existence of a real root ....It tells nothing more... that every odd degree polynomial will have a real root. Part 2:The sign of this real root is opposite to that of its last term provided that the coefficient of highest degree term is positive. It talks only about the sign of the root.... nothing more .... It will just give you sign of the root.It tells that sign of the root is opposite to the sign of the last term (term without the x) ..... provided if coefficient of first term (term with highest degree of x) is positive.So you will get just the sign but not the root of the polynomial. In your question there will be at least one root with negative sign.Note: Please do not mug up these type of silly statements .... I can easily make at least 10 similar statements.

Mayank-Jain-99,"In past, I have prepared hard for an exam. I prepared for my dream, I worked hard to clear IIT JEE (An engineering entrance exam in India), I submerged myself in Physics, Chemistry, Maths (PCM) and in 2005 I got astonishing success.After the exam, I was completely out of touch to the subjects. After 9 years on a shiny day I decided to teach for IIT JEE exam. Now I had the biggest challenge, How I will recall everything I learnt 9 year back and how can I get to IIT JEE level or even better to answer all doubts of the students.I was afraid that it may take a lot of time to recall everything, I learnt 9 year back but when I started the preparation for my 3rd attempt*. I was astonished with the effortless recall I had.For Physics, In most of the chapters, one hour was enough to recall that chapter. After reading one hour from the book I read during my prepration and solving some questions. I got back to the IIT JEE level. Yes one hour was more than enough to recall everything.Maths was even better, I can solve most of the problems in the chapters just after looking at the formulas.For chemistry, It was nightmare at that time and I still fear from it. Now I should stop bragging and tell you how I did learn it for forever:First and most important You must learn, ""How to Learn"".Love the subject, If you do not love a subject, you may clear the exam or you may top it but the learning will not be long lasting and it will fade away with time. Like I did for chemistry. Repeated and continuous revision: Revision is not the last day hustle, it is a continuous process. You should spaced your learning and read, re-read, recall and again recall, practice and again practice. These are the essential step for long lasting learning. I have written two very good blog post for this:What is revision ?

Mayank-Jain-99,"Whenever we buy, we want to satisfy our requirement as economically as possible. We buy items which satisfy our need and generally try to avoid items which has some not required extra features. This extra feature will only add cost or may increase future expenditure to maintain unused feature.A perfect example would be a normal TV vs smart TV. I do not want to use any smart feature of TV, I have smart phone and laptop for that. I only want my TV to follow my orders and repetitively do the same work of display channels. If ever I want to use any smart feature like watching YouTube or surf net on my TV, I will let my laptop to supervise and connect laptop to my TV.Same happens in industry, the work of worker is mostly repeated in nature. They supposed to follow the standard operating procedure (SOP) as strictly as possible. Generally we do not want them to deviate from SOP. In case of a problem we use supervisors (Mostly engineers) and these supervisor will do the smart work.For your future growth, you should not join any company as worker.

Mayank-Jain-99,"I am in same situation as yours. I love teaching, mentoring students and helping them to become a more contributing citizen and I am doing my duty as an IITian by contributing in this way.After doing a job I did not love and contributing less than 10% of my capacity I realized, It does not matter what other think, it matters more what you think. You should do what you love not what you supposed to do.If you love teaching go for it.Some advice and breaking some myth:Coaching industry is very competitive and and there is no long term dividend like you get in all other jobs. After 15-20 years you may be replaced by a younger version of you.It is very challenging, IIT make it challenging by changing patterns. I feel it is easy to get AIR 121 again but it is very difficult to help an average student to achieve such a goal.It is not an easy job, I will rate it as one of the tough job any IITian can get. Imagine yourself standing and talking contentiously 7-8 hours a day while you keep updating yourself.Pay package is not very good as it looks from distance. Initial package is not even half you get in other industries but if you rose in the ranks you can get very attractive package. A advice from a senior, I will strongly recommend you to teach for some time as part time while you are in IIT, You can also look for internship in December and have a feel of what is to work in the industry then only you should take a final call.  If you are interested for an intern, you can contact me.",high,mid,mid,low,low

Mayank-Jain-99,"Have a commitment test than you should decide that you are fit for a drop or not.You have around 10 days for BITSAT. Have a 7 days test of your commitment: Test yourself and your commitment by working hard for 7 days and study for BITSAT, Leave all your hobbies, distraction, quora, social media, friends and GF/ BF for 7 days. Ensure at least 12-14 hour of study + 7-8 hour of sleep. Even if any major event like marriage of your brother  comes, ensure 10 hour of study. Start this from today it-self and no delay. If you cannot do it for 7 days what will happen in a year so before any decision test your commitment.If you fail miserably in this commitment test do not even think once about a drop and join any collage you get.Remember you need to start this from today itself.If you have passed this commitment test, After the BITSAT, continue this routine for next 2 weeks (total 21 days). In these 2 weeks, do not pressurize yourself but study for 10-12 hours and look for your inner voice. By this time you will have clear idea about your abilities, your commitment, your weakness and an idea that you can take a drop or not.Other points to check:Take a drop when you are highly motivated and want to work very hard. It should be your idea and no one has forced you.Drop only if you are sure that you have capacity to either get IIT or jump two tier in collage listing. i.e. Tier-1: IITs, Tier-2: NITs & IIITs, Tier-3: Government collage and top Private collage and Tier-4: Normal Private collage.

Mayank-Jain-99,"First: Delaying election: This was the biggest mistake by BJP. They should have encased Modi wave. This delay gave time to AAP to create their vote bank and their Moholla Shabha paid off. In early elections ""Chal Bhag Bhagoda"" campaign may have worked.Second: Kiran Bedi: She was one of their biggest asset and she must have paid very well if she was used effectively. It may have been very effective if they have invited Kiran Bedi 3-4 month earlier and she started her campaign 3-4 month back. It will also gave BJP some time to analyse effect of her, before declaring her CM candidate. BJP de-motivated their volunteers by changing the leadership just few weeks before the election.Third: Trying to save Modi's image: They all started saying that Delhi election is not referendum of central government. We all knew it and there was no need to explain it. By saying it again and again you just confirmed that you also accepted that you are going to loss. It drifted vote of people who wanted stable government toward AAP. Fourth: Instead of Pro-development campaign they relied on defamation campaign: Development was BJPs biggest agenda and they won all elections (in 2013 and 2014) based on this agenda but in Delhi they didn't used it well. They always tried to defame Mr. Kejriwal by saying him ""Bhagoda"", opportunist and corrupt. We all was fad up by this. When they used AVAM to defame AAP, we think little about 2 crore of AAP but think more about 1000 crore of BJP's undeclared fund.

That's why entrepreneurs are respected and needed. Howie Reith's answer explain it very well.When you earn money, in a broader sense you do not earn money, you earn wealth and it is not constant. The million dollar you have earned are not in the form of hard case but in the form of wealth you own.Now I will show you how our new believe about everyone getting richer is better than our old believe.If you look around and look closely at people you know. Compare their wealth before 10 years and now. You will find, in general most of the people are richer.When you evaluate the process of making 1 million. You will find you have created some value and that value must be more than 1 million. Where does that extra wealth gone. You have made someone else richer.

Aditya-Jais,"I have a friend in office, a very philosophical guy, he never married.He is still single. Though he fell in love once, he couldn’t commit to the girl. She finally left him.He once said , ”Aditya, if she really loved me, she would not need an invisible string of marriage to hold on to me. The fact that she needed one suggests that she couldn’t love me enough to make it work without one”I thought about this, not for hours but for days, just when I was on verge of believing this theory, something happened. Something very bad.My mom and dad had the worst fight of their lives.My mom swore she would not talk to my dad again. They did not for a couple of months.I was furious with all this, my mom would cry all day, even while talking on the phone. One fine day I asked my mom, “Why don’t you leave him? go your separate ways”. She thought for a moment and said “Because I am married to him, I vowed to be with him in thick and thin. This is probably the thinnest we have come.” Now after 1 year, they are happy together, like nothing ever happened. All those broken bridges are mended. All arguments are forgotten and all that is left is their love for each other. This made me realize that Relationships are not only about love but they are also about hatred, frustrations and  disappointmentsAnd Marriage is that invisible thread which holds you together when the light of your love is wrapped around by the clouds of misunderstandings.It holds you together during those weak moments of your relationship.And believe me, no matter how much love you have for each other, sometimes there comes those weak moments and you need marriage to hold things together.Plus for some;In non philosophical words, as  Steven N Czetli said;Marriage can have the effect of counting to ten before doing something rash.[Edit1]Here's another perspective on marriage, its conveyed through this story:Aditya Jais' answer to Why is it that women end up settling for - as in marrying - less attractive guys?[Edit2]And on love:Aditya Jais' answer to What makes love last?",mid,high,high,mid,low
Aditya-Jais,"I was once in a train, travelling from Bangalore to Delhi. It was 12 in the noon.The train journey are sometimes really boring, I try to sleep through them. I was striving really hard to fall asleep when I heard this orchestra with flute and drums playing in the platform.Then before I could realize what’s going on, a big family with 15-20 people (I still don’t know the exact number) entered my coach. They encroached most of my compartment and couple of side ones.Visibly irritated I got up and headed to the bathroom. When I came back they were already settled and preparing for their first snack (of many more to come). They offered me some. I took. Now the best way to make someone feel at home is to offer them food. I started feeling at home now.We started the conversation and apparently they were heading back from one of the big fat Indian weddings.We were playing charades and I can see myself being a part of the dirty jokes making rounds among the guys. The dirty jokes about groom’s first night.The sun was setting and it was already getting dark, they decided to start dinner now.In India, food would be first offered to the oldest person in the family, in this case groom’s grandfather.One of the ladies offered him the food, to which he politely declined saying that he was waiting for Rukma.Rukma was Groom’s grandmother; she was sleeping all this while. Apparently she was not very well.I was pressing him really hard to eat when one of the guys from the group pulled me aside and explained. He said,” In their 70 years of marriage, they never ate without each other” ”For everyone back home they serve as an example of truest love” he added.Now I was very curious. I was staring at him, he was visibly very hungry. But he chose not to show it.I knew it was not my place, but out of curiosity I asked him, “So baba (grandsire) what is it that keeps your love alive for each other”He was visibly curious and a little agitated; perhaps this was a frequent question for him.He took a deep breath, looked at me and said, “Beta (son) there is only one secret to the long lasting love” “You must always VALUE your partner” he added.This isn’t exactly a magic spell I wondered.He continued, “When you Value your partner you strive to keep her with you. In order for that to happen you start caring for her; you start respecting her; you treat her as a valuable asset; you make conscious efforts to make her happy. When you do all this, you get all of this in return.”So you Value her every single day of your life and everything else would follow up and everything would fall in its place.So what was your original question?

Aditya-Jais,"What? Your dog doesn’t listen to you!Oh My God!Okay I think I am being a little too melodramatic; before we find a solution, let me walk through the past couple of years of my dog life. Let’s see1)     2.5 Years ago I got this cute little fawn color Labrador puppy, he looked like an angle wearing a dogs skin. Cute little toes, Small mouth, Side hanging ears and a small wagging tail. We named him Charlie2)      Use to piss and poop all over the house. We let him do it, He was like our baby.3)     My mother use to feed him with her own hands, one small morsel at a time.4)     He grew old. We celebrated his first birthday. He wore a small party hat. He Eat all his birthday cake, all of it, Left nothing for us, not even a drop of icing. We let him eat it, He was like our baby.5)     Outside was too hot for him, he use to sleep in my parents’ bedroom. My father allowed him.6)     Every morning the Charlie would get up at 5 O clock and bark around my dad’s bed. He would eventually get up. Half asleep, rub his groggy eyes and take him out for a walk.7)     Once on the road, he would run all around the area, he would ignore my dad’s call. My dad would to be very happy seeing him playing around like this.8)     More than once, he found a sack of dog food on the loft, drag it down, tore it open and ate like there was no tomorrow. At this end he would have eaten so much that he would not be able to walk. He would drag on the floor up to my parents’ bedroom, pull himself up and crash on his couch. He would then sleep for 2 straight days. We were very happy seeing his naughty acts.9)     When we call him during his sleep time. He would open his eyes, throw a careless look at us and shut it close again. He would completely ignore us.10)  He would drink from his pot and try to wipe off the water from his face on my mom’s pants.We put up with all his non sense acts and to be frank it was all very amusing moments. Now after 2.5 years. 1)      He wakes up at 5 and quietly waits for my father, by his bed. He would always make sure that no one disturbs my father while he is sleeping.2)     He would not eat any food on his own, unless my mom pushes his bowl towards him.3)      He would never leave my dad’s side while on a walk; he comes at once, whenever called upon.4)     No matter what the time is, if we shout his name, he would appear as if from nowhere.5)     He never piss or poop anywhere in the house. If he wants to he would bark.6)      I can’t even hug my parents in his presence; he gets all possessive and starts barking.7)      He snuggles with my sister’s rabbits, like they are his own child.8)     If scolded, he would go to a corner and would act all depressed. He would not eat his food. When called, he would watch you from the corner of his eyes and then ignore you.Unless mom and dad apologies to him cuddle him and give him a bone; he would not eat at all.9)     No one can even try to physically harm my parents in his presence. He would get very aggressive. Conclusion:I think you might have already spotted the differences in my dog’s behavior between then and now.He has become a lot more matured, understanding and disciplined.But between all this discipline and maturity; he still possesses that naive childlike quality.His cute childlike actions which would make you fall in love with him.Dogs are like small babies, they learn in their own time. You must be patient with them. Else they would stop trusting you and  turn hostile towards you. Much like our kids. If you still wish, you can train him(there are a lot of YouTube videos on this), with a paper roll in your hand and an expression of hostility on your face. But at the end you’ll not end up with a CUTE LOVING DOG but, a disciplined SLAVE ROBOT.",mid,high,high,mid,low

NASA tops the list.11)  White house steps in, promises to contain the damage, and Cuts additional budget for NASA and shutdown some of the ongoing exploration projects. The budget from these projects is used to plan a rescue mission.12)  Bobby returns to earth, but NASA’s brand named is tarnished forever.13)  NASA’s reputation is ruined for life, Thousands of aspiring kids abandoned their plan to become an astronaut. Many thousand really interested Emigrate to Russia to join their space program. Hide the news, and dismiss the idea of the rescue: 1)     NASA ignores Bobby on the MARS.2)     He starves to death.3)     Couple of years later, A NASA Employee, while seeking asylum in Russia, releases a press statement, he says, “NASA left Bobby on Mars, because it was costing them Billions to bring him back”4)     Final result: Point number 13 from the previous section. So Finally NASA would have two choices, either to get the Astronaut from MARS or reestablish the whole NASA as far away from earth as possible.",mid,high,high,mid,low
Aditya-Jais,"Really!Am I to assume that there are no Volkswagen employees on Quora? or are they busy tackling the issue:PAnyways, I think I can partially answer this question;First let me establish my authority to answer this: I worked for a tier 1 automotive supplier, which is under investigation for its Airbags malfunction, did it ring a bell?If you were following the automotive world news for the past year, this news would have come across quite few times.The company manufactures Airbags for all the leading OEM's in the world, in fact it is consistently ranked 3 worldwide in this category. They are in fact very good in what they do.Last year NHTSA USA started a massive investigation on them, after they linked 8 deaths and more than 100 injuries to its airbag malfunction.A massive recall plan (for 23 million vehicles only in The USA) started. Compare that to only 11 million Volkswagen vehicles worldwide.I was there while all this was going on.So I think I can answer this,This is how it would have started for Volkswagen: 1) One fine day, while reading news and sipping a cup of coffee, you’ll (you being a Volkswagen employee) come across a small tiny teeny article about an issue with one of the product from you company. You'll think it’s not a big deal, complete your coffee and head to work.2) On reaching office, you'll find small clusters of people all around the breaking  area, discussing this issue, you'll be curious and excited at first.3) After some days the discussion would begin to bore you, but there are still news coming up in papers every day.4) And Boom!!!..... The company confesses the wrong doing on this matter, Releases a nationwide apology to its customer and assures them that this would be handled well.5) Stock price fell by 20%, Employees with ESOP (Employees stock option) have started feeling uneasy at this moment. Company declares a damage control package. Stocks fall by another 10%6) Now the office talks become very interesting, Most of the employees who know nothing more that the common person following this issue in newspaper, would start to give there Expert Engineering advice on the matter.7) Employees have got a solid reason to trash their company and fuck the management. In reality most of them don’t give damn to the real issue, they are just expressing their anger for a shitty performance appraisal they got last month.8) Suddenly you start seeing mails from Vice Presidents and presidents of the PR group, requesting you to refrain from answering any question on this matter to the outside world (This is why we don’t have any one answering on this matter here). 9) Company reshuffles the management and brings in a top guy. The old CEO resigns. Employee confirms to companies’ decision, says old CEO was anyways not worthy.10) 99.9% of employees would not feel guiltier on this issue than a common man, and why should they?After all it was not there group who was directly involved in the development and manufacturing of those diesel engines and there Electronic control units.This was just the nuclear explosion, now would start the real fallout from this: This is what would happen next: 11) Recall numbers start pouring in and number are way more than anyone ever expected. Then comes the penalty figures by various governments from all over the world.12) The final figure, if at all final, seems to eat away most of this and last year's profits.13) Sales start declining, the mighty Made in Germany shield has been compromised.12) To limit the losses, some of the R and D projects are put on hold. Now people have started feeling uneasy. 13) At this point of time, the  atmosphere is not very friendly, people start uploaded there resume.14) Company starts losing two types of people: Completely Incompetent and highly competent.15) In its own time Volkswagen completes its recall and takes all the financial blows. Sales have started to bottom out (the worst in the last 60 years).16) Some top notch marketing firm is hired and a revival plan is set in motion.17) For next 1 year you see a Volkswagen advertisement on every piece of paper you come across (hopefully not on my toilet paper). It’s everywhere, on TV, on internet and on social network. And somehow in all the advertisement, the car is shown to save people from fire, from floods from UV rays. They show car saving hanging people from Clift’s and from a lion.18) Eventually all these advertisements would subconsciously make us believe in the power and safety of these German cars.19) 3 Years down the line, sales are on target and I am hoping to pick a girl in a bar, flaunting my new Volkswagen Passat![Edit] : Removed the ""stock prices are back on track"" statement.

Aditya-Jais,"The Monetary support extended by The Indian government to various nations is known as Line of Credit (LOC).Before looking at details, lets first understand this:a)     The line of credit is a loan provided at a subsidized rate(not free, it is not charity)b)     This is done via EXIM Bank India; this is popularly known as the Export Import Bank of India.It was established under The Export Import bank of India Act, 1981.c)      Under the LOC, a minimum of 75% of goods and services needs to be of an Indian origin and must be imported/procured from India.d)      Up Until now 225 LOCs are extended to 61 countries under the Development and Economic Assistance Schemee)     These LOCs have been extended to countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania and the CIS, totaling $14.87 billion.These Lines Of Credit are of immense strategic importance for India, Lets analyze the ROI (Return on Investment) for India;1)      As the borrowing nation is supposed to spend 75% of the total goods and services in India Inc’s, this boost the Exports from India, This helps in economic recovery and contain CAD(Current account deficit).2)     These companies then pay Taxes on their profits and create jobs, The new employees then pay taxes on their salaries and spend their earnings on more goods and services, this in turn adds to the indirect tax collection for the government. This creates a ripple effect for government and economy.3)     This export model provides a Launchpad for small and medium enterprises, bringing them to the front line. This helps boost the manufacturing sector of the country and would ultimately contribute to the Make in India model.4)     Serves as diplomatic steps to foster or mend relations between India and the receiving country.$2 Billion to Bangladesh:a)     Would create 50,00 jobs in Indiab)     Bangladesh would buy equipment from BHEL, RITES and small and medium enterprises.c)      Would boost cement and steel industries.$1 Billion to Mongolia:a)     Could serve as a key for Indian Corporations to enter Mongolia’s mining industry, please remember that Mongolia has one of the biggest reserves of Rare earth minerals widely used in the electronics industry. If India could ensure a non-stop supply of these minerals, it would help its Make in India Model.b)     Having a friend close to the China would be a very tactical advantage for India.c)       Other areas of interest between the two countries are pharmaceuticals, defense, healthcare and civil nuclear sectors. Srilanka:This is perhaps the most important of the three for Indian Government.India has many strategic advantages here;a)       Port development to control trade in Indians oceans. Srilanka has the deepest ports in the world to dock giant mother ships, this works like a mother ship docking station for India.b)     Its recent closeness to China.c)      Srilanka's Tamil population – They have been India’s extended arm. All these benefits out weights the initial cost of the credit.And as Balaji Viswanathan always says, Trade if done wisely, is always good for both sides.",mid,high,high,mid,low

Aditya-Jais,"Interesting question!Before I give you the answer, I want to make sure that all my readers understand the whole story of the Volkswagen emissions scandal.If you are not interested in this part, please jump to the second half of this answer, The How.What is the scandal: Volkswagen disobeyed the emission rules set in place by various environmental Protection agencies around the globe. For USA this would be violation of emissions set by USEPA-specifically those for nitrous oxides, or NOx, a major contributor to photochemical smog.Why? The answer comes down to combination of cost, fuel efficiency and performance.To understand these forces, it's important to understand the global auto market. Volkswagen AG is the only European maker among the three largest global automakers; the other two are General Motors (U.S.) and Toyota (Japan).As such, VW is influenced by its home market. And in Europe, since the 1990s, diesel cars have made up roughly half of all passenger car sales. The numbers vary by country, but in the European Union, it's been at one of two for 10 years.As Europe's best-selling automaker by far, Volkswagen has devoted an inordinate amount of its powertrain development effort to diesel engines.The problem is that U.S. and European emission standards for diesel diverged sharply in 2008. The U.S. adopted much stricter rules (known as”Tier 2, Bin 5"") on emissions of virtually every component of diesel exhaust.Europe, on the other hand, stayed with the so-called Euro 5 standards. Its emission limits only moved up to roughly the U.S. level this year.But while other makers--including Toyota, Honda, General Motors, and Ford--began to introduce gasoline hybrid-electric vehicles to boost their fuel efficiency, VW chose to stick with diesels.They went on to explain that diesels were naturally more cost-efficient than hybrids, because the latter required fitting two separate powertrains (gasoline and electric) and a very pricey battery pack into a car.But the reality is that VW was unable to create an efficient hybrid to compete with the other makersthis left them with no choice but to continue with their diesel.But these diesel engines were still not complying with the US emission controls, but if VW tries to keep the emission with the permissible range, the performance and subsequently the sales would go down.So VW decided to launch the same engine configuration with a cheating device and a brand new name.Thus VW clean Diesel was born.How:Usually USEPA would take the car to their lab, hook an emission sensing device to its tail pipe and drive the car on a treadmill.This simulates the real world working of engine. But not that of steering!This fact was used by VW to cheat the exam.During lab test driving, unlike in the real world driving, the steering would not be used aggressively.The car would be simply places on a treadmill and would be made to run.The steering would be stationery all this while.The software running on one of the electronic control unit (ECU) of the car would detect this condition and drive the car into the lab testing mode.In this mode, the Engine control module (another miniature computer) onboard would change the Engine tuning to a low emission setting.This means Low Emissions and Low performance.Once off the lab, the car would be back into the driving mode and would start its dirty routine![Edit1]: There seems to be a little confusion regarding the actual functionality of the defect device.I'll try to throw light over this: The main objective of the defect device is to differentiate between actual driving and driving under tests.Usually the testing would be done in the lab (up until the researcher did this on road), car running on the treadmill would exhibit a slightly different behavior than the actual driving conditions. This could be sensed using some of the following indicators: 1) Software can recognize a testing pattern: acceleration at a particular rate, a steady-state hold, followed by measured deceleration.2) barometric pressure3) Vehicle speed4) Steering positionsNow please be aware that these are just some inputs, these are used in combination(with many others) to detect the car under test.But this would not work if the car is tested while it is been driven on road (this is how VW got busted) There are hacks for other types of testing also, for instance Dyno testing - Thanks to Stephen Hughes for asking this question.Under Dyno testing, VW would most probably use the inputs from the non-driven wheels - since they would be stationary when dyno testing the car, to detect the car under test.For an interesting answer related to this topic please refer: Aditya Jais' answer to Volkswagen Emissions Scandal (September 2015): How do you feel as a Volkswagen employee who discovered the scandal along with the rest of the world?",mid,high,high,mid,low
Aditya-Jais,"Here is the complete timeline of the Volkswagen scandal, starting way back in 2011.2007: Suspect software first installed According to the mass-circulation daily Bild, auto parts supplier Bosch  Gmbh made the suspect software available to Volkswagen in 2007, ""purely  for purposes of internal testing only."" The automaker begins to  install the technology in its vehicles, despite  a warning from Bosch  that it was illegal to do so in cars destined for  sale to the general  public. It was also in 2007 that Martin Winterkorn was appointed Volkswagen's chief executive. 2011: Alarms raised According  to the Sunday newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung, a VW employee sounded the alarm bell that the software might ""infringe"" legislation, but that did not prevent the carmaker from continuing to install it. 2014: Researchers test vehicles Researchers  at the University of West Virginia are commissioned by the   International Council on Clean Transportation to subject Volkswagen   vehicles to road tests. The findings suggest the cars spew up to 40 times as much nitrogen oxide than is legally permissible. The researchers inform the US authorities, who in turn ask Volkswagen for a response. The carmaker argues that the anomalies between the tests and   the road performance are due to ""different technical problems"" and   unexpected conditions of use. By the end of 2014, Volkswagen of the United States recalls a number of models for ""software updates"" and tells the authorities it has remedied the problem. May 2015: New tests The US authorities, including the California Air Resources Board,   undertake a new series of tests, the results of which are still unsatisfactory. CARB informs Volkswagen and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A series of ""technical meetings"" between the carmaker and the authorities ensues. July 2015: Environmentalist questions In response to a question from the environmentalist, the German  government says it is aware of the existence of technologies that can skew the results of emission tests, but says it has no information  about whether such devices are actually in use. September 3: VW confession Unable to provide any convincing answers, Volkswagen admits to CARB and EPA that it deliberately installed the software in its cars. September 18: Authorities go public Just as VW shows off its new ""eco-friendly"" models at the IAA auto show  in  Frankfurt, CARB and EPA go public with their accusations that Volkswagen installed clean-air cheating device software to evade US limits on nitrogen oxide and other pollutants. According to the US  authorities, about 482,000 cars in the United  States are equipped with  the so-called ""defeat device"" software that covertly turns off pollution controls when the car is being driven and turns on when it  detects that the vehicle is being tested for emissions. September 20: Winterkorn 'sorry' VW  issues a statement late on Sunday in which Winterkorn, 68, says he  is  ""deeply sorry"" for having ""broken the trust of our customers and the   public."" He vows that VW will ""cooperate fully"" with the authorities  and  ""will do everything to re-establish"" that trust. September 21: Stock sinks VW  shares go into a tailspin when markets opened, plunging more than 17   percent and sending around 15 billion euros up in smoke. The German   government orders immediate ""specific and extensive"" tests on the vehicles concerned. South Korea follows suit, announcing emission tests on three different Volkswagen car models in mid-October. September 22: 11 million vehicles VW shares shed a further 20 percent and drag down other car stocks. The   carmaker confesses that 11 million vehicles worldwide are equipped with   the cheating software and Winterkorn offers his ""deepest apologies"". September 23: Winterkorn resigns Under fire, Winterkorn resigns, accepting responsibility as CEO for the   affair, but insisting that he personally was ""not aware of wrongdoing."" Public prosecutors in Germany launch a preliminary inquiry after  receiving a number of legal complaints from private individuals against VW. Rating agency Fitch threatens to downgrade the carmaker's credit-worthiness. September 24: EU urges probes Pressure continues to build on VW as the EU urges its 28 member states  to  investigate whether vehicles comply with European pollution rules. Private law firms are also lining up to take on the German company, with a class action suit already filed by a Seattle law firm. September 25: New CEO, US ban Volkswagen names Matthias Mueller, the 62-year-old head of VW's luxury sportscar brand Porsche, as Winterkorn's successor. The new boss promises to do everything to shed light on the affair. In the US, authorities ban sales of Volkswagen diesel cars until 2016, while Switzerland suspends sales of new Volkswagen models. September 28: Criminal probe German prosecutors open a criminal investigation against ex-CEO  Winterkorn, saying the probe will focus on the allegation of fraud by selling  vehicles with manipulated emission values. ""The aim of the investigation is to clarify the chain of responsibility,"" prosecutors   say.Source: Timeline of events in Volkswagen pollution cheating scandalMore info on this topic:Aditya  Jais' answer to Volkswagen Emissions Scandal (September 2015): How do  you feel as a Volkswagen employee who discovered the scandal along with  the rest of the world?Aditya Jais' answer to How exactly does the Volkswagen emission fraud work?",mid,high,high,mid,low
Aditya-Jais,"I have been with both type of girls. A beautiful robin and an intelligent, understanding  and interesting macaw.They both seem to have their own speciality. While beautiful ones are eye candies and trophies the other ones are comfortable, mature, adjusting and easy to live with.Then there is a third category which are hybrids, they are mature and educated and easy to live with plus they are beautiful.Now these are the ones which are the game changers in your case.A guy looking for a girl on a matrimonial website undoubtedly wants a girl like you, but he also desires a little beauty on the sides which is more or less driven by his genes.Now you may be the best fitting hat for him, only if he gets to wear you once (not literally, but metaphorically), i am sure he will fall for you with a force of G6. But unfortunately his genes driven by his animal instincts aren't allowing him cross the eye candy criteria.Now i being an invester always thinks from a profit or loss angle. A beutiful girl with none of your qualities is like an overpriced asset whose value would depreciate as time goes. We call this depreciating asset.On the other hand a girl with good values, maturity, comforting nature and education is like an appreciating asset. With time your intelligence, maturity and understanding would only grow. So from that angle marrying you is more beneficial than marrying Alia Bhat.Now the question remains, why would boys not select you?..... And the answer is, Because they are fools, fools not to see over and above the animal instincts, fools because even after being 27 years old they have still not realised what a perfect life partner should be like and fools because one day a guy would notice you, a guy who is matured enough to know your worth, and would snatch you right from his gaze and would prove to you his worth.And then one day you would tell you kids, how you met their father and the love of your life and how you lived happily there after.PS : This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of  pros and cons about choosing the right girl.

This means that you have midcap/smallcap funds in your portfolio which is bringing down the weightage.Now to answer your question,Is 25% weightage for financial sector good?It depends...Depends on what type of MF you have invested into(if its all diversified funds and no sectorial funds, than you are good). On a broader scale i can say that your portfolio looks pretty balanced.However if you would want exposure to a specific sector like FMCG or Pharma, you could invest into sectorial MF. But i would advise you against this, because this would take away diversity from your portfolio.

If I do more practice on my speech, I can even attempt to be around 98-99%, which I started to do now a days. 100% is definitely possible, I just don't mention it as it cannot happen everytime, sometimes my words slip off a bit unknowingly. I might speak a bit too fast, making the letters disappear into thin air :P When I see people's surprised looks, I realise that I spoke a bit too fast, and then say the words again slowly. If it's a familiar person, they don't hesitate to let me know- that they didn't follow what I said, I would say it again.P.S:- What ever I said above about my speech- the speed, or slip ups, it happens very rarely. Most of the people don't really know that I am deaf when they converse with me at first. Only I have to let them know that I am deaf, so that they won't misunderstand me missing some of the words they said to me during a conversation. This all was possible because as a small girl, I was made to go to a school- Bala Vidyalaya for the deaf and dumb. It's a primary school, they teach you up to first standard, they teach us to speak and listen with how much ever capabilities we have. They also include English, maths, basically a normal school.

Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"It happened during this year 12th std board exams in March month. I can remember the moment so clearly as it flashes through my head. I was seated inside a room with my friends preparing for the next exam ‘Computer’. We were in one of the rooms in tution, we looked up, a guy entered in our room, the way he was looking at me seems like we had met somewhere before. But I knew we had never met before, I lowered my gaze as I begun to focus my attention to the subject.  He was about to take a chair as there wasn’t enough chairs at his room, so he went to the corner and made efforts to take the chair. But then a lady stopped him, as it was impossible for him to take that chair due to lots of obstacles to the entrance. She asked him to take the chair of mine and my friends, we got up. He took my chair, before taking my chair he smiled a small smile, and he looked at me and spoke something before dragging my chair out. He was waiting for a moment, my friends were staring at me. I didn’t really listen to him, I didn’t expect him to speak to me, I thought he was speaking to someone else.  I thought he might have needed some help so I grabbed the door for him and opened it and pointed him towards the door. It looks like he was in a daze, and he came out of it. Until my friends and I sat down, my friend asked me if I knew him. I was puzzled as though why she would ask me that. I answered her no. She replied that he actually spoke to me the following words, ""Hi, what's up?"". I was shocked was an understatement. I questioned her whether she was sure, she replied yes. When I asked her “why?” she replied ” You are beautiful.” I answered her that it wasn't true. The other friend replies that not to say more,(name of a guy who they teased me with, honestly there is nothing) would be jealous. But I can’t get over the fact that he tried to speak to me not my friends, usually and always it’s the reverse.   And honestly I don’t know what made him to speak to me till now, maybe he learnt from others I m hearing impaired, or maybe he just liked to flirt, or maybe he just wanted to be friend, or maybe or he was looking for a way to pass his time. I felt sorry that I didn’t reply him back, honestly I didn’t think he was speaking to me. He was cute. Right now I can’t remember his face, but the moment is still strong in my mind. I felt like a bitch who didn’t reply him back. I am not one, it’s just I didn’t hear him.If it's possible that the guy is in quora and reading this answer, sincerely know that I am sorry, I didn't  really mean to be rude.",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Maybe there are many funny incidents in my school life, but as the question suggested for the ""Best"" memory in classroom, there is one memory which will always be close to my heart, it's really silly or something, but that was the day I began to gain a bit of confidence about myself and my life in general. I was in 9th std in a CBSE school, and there was a new English teacher. As I was deaf/hearing impaired, I had to often let the new teachers know that as they wouldn't  misunderstand me, so I did let her know about it. At that time the CCE pattern was introduced, for those of you who don't know about the system, it means we had to do more of practical work instead of paper- pen test to score marks like projects, assignments, group work, presentations, and all. So as a tool for the English subject, there was 'Just a Minute' talk, which everyone had to pick up a sheet from the bowl full of papers which contained the topics we had to speak on the topic for a minute, we were given two minutes time to prepare on what we were going to say for it. I used to be self conscious about my speech and language and still do (but now I am much better than before.) At that time I used to assume that people would never get me when I was talking, except my friends and those people who were used to me. So when my turn came up, the teacher asked me if I could do it, I didn't want to, but seeing the classmates stares and the teacher's patience, I couldn't say no. So I replied a yes softly. She asked me if I wanted to say about any topic I wanted to, I was free to. She gave me that advantage, but I couldn't think up of any topic, and I was feeling weird to take her up on that offer. Instead I asked her if I could pick up the sheet of paper.She still insisted me that I could really say about anything I would like to. But I picked up the sheet, it was written, ""Schooling"". I did prepare mentally on what I was going to say about the topic, I thought I would share about the good things of school more specifically- the boring parts like how the school works, like technical stuff. When it was my turn to speak up to the class audience, I was indeed very nervous, all the people eyes were on me at that moment. I almost forgot my topic. I introduced myself first, then I told them the topic I was about to tell them about. I was looking at the back wall, which was facing me in the front direction as I was giving a speech to them. Instead I just ignored those words which I had mentally prepared, instead I was filled with nostalgia about how we would miss school when we will leave it. So I began it by saying, ""A person's best part of their life will always be their school life. "" I saw one of the front bencher smile a huge grin, from that onwards I kept looking into one classmates eyes to another to look as though we were having a conversation, I just became lost in the memories, recollecting some of the best moments in school life out loud, like bunking classes, making fun of the teacher when they aren't looking, eating each other's lunches, the school trips, how some are teachers pet and others are not, birthdays celebrated in schools, scoldings, punishments received, like that and so on. I didn't even feel that the teacher was there in the classroom, and when I had nothing more to share. I stopped the speech, and it was absolute silence, I was scared of the teacher now as I remembered how I was making fun of the teachers. I didn't care at that moment, if anyone understood my words or not. She showed a blank look and called me to come near her. I went to her with hesitation, I thought she would yell at me or something, instead she gave a kiss on my cheeks, I felt embarrassed, by then the entire class stood up and gave me a standing ovation, again I was feeling embarrassed. When I returned to my seat, the teacher asked me loudly in front of all, if I could have spoke for ten more minutes. I didn't get at first what she was trying to convey to me. Then my friend told me that I spoke for more than a minute, and it was really awesome. I just smiled. She then said, ""There are many others in this classroom, but they can't even come up with two normal sentences, and here she told it so beautifully and perfect."" I was really surprised to hear the words come out of her. That was when I realised that even hearing people do have fear, but personally I feel they should not. She did end up giving me praises and all, my friends and class mates all did say me, awesome speech and all. I still remember the surprised looks on their faces. When I asked my friends, that was my words clear enough for others to understand, they were like, obviously otherwise how everyone understood it, they were telling me that it's all in my head. From that day onwards, I felt a bit better about my speech. The surprising part is the other students from other classes came to know about my speech and all, they were also congratulating me. I was surprised further. :) So this is one of my best memories till date. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Thanks Akshay for A2A :) My answer may not be that interesting enough, I hope I can do my dad justice with this answer. My dad was born into a typical Hindi lower middle class family, where he was one of the 6 siblings. He was a good cricket player when he was young, he was one of the state players in his time, and he could have gone for national teams but he couldn't because of shortage of money funds. After completing his tenth std, he started helping his father in doing jobs (transportation), and he still studied at school up to 12th std. He even got good scores that time even after doing work for his dad. He gave up going college, as he was the second eldest boy of the family, he had to earn money. He grew up and got a job in a good company. Then he married my mom in an arranged marriage, and they settled in Bombay due to my dad's job. And then I was born. When I was just three years old, they came to know that I was deaf - hearing impaired. They searched schools all over Bombay, there were deaf schools available there but they taught in sign languages. My parents didn't want me to be different, so they searched for more better schools. They came into a contact with a good ear doctor who advised my parents that there was a school which helped kids like me to hear and speak but that school was present only in chennai. My dad didn't give it an another thought, he left his job, didn't have much money, and shifted to chennai with my mom and me for my education here. He started his own business in Chennai, and I am proud to say that his business is going good now. And our financial status improved a lot compared to his early ages. Most fathers would have ignored to make any effort, but he didn't ignore it or they would have made me to learn sign language but he didn't want me to be different. I didn't mean to offend anyone, it was my parents choice and I do support it :) I was always smart in my school studies, my dad knew that but he never showed it to me. I studied in a mainstream school. (It means normal one, if anyone was wondering.) He was like most fathers who never expressed their true feelings to us, but they loved us from the bottom of their hearts. I learnt of my tenth std results in one of my cousin's brother marriage. I got a 9.8 cgpa out of 10. I was still in shock as I never expected this much marks, and when I shared it with my father, he had a huge smile plastered on his face, and gave me a hug.(When I grew up, we don't show each other with physical contact like hugs or kisses, even now. That's why it was a big deal. ) I can never forget him smiling the entire day. That day I will always cherish in my heart :) (that's why I am nervous for my 12th results, I sincerely hope it should be good enough for my dad :P Please do pray for me :) ) Then when my 11th std started, I received my first smartphone. I used to text with my friends, and cousins. I made a huge mistake of texting one of my cousin late at night, covering with a blanket, pretending to be asleep at 10:30. I was scared of my dad, he was a bit conservative, and old fashioned. I was caught for doing that thing. My dad threatened me that he would take away my phone. I was upset not because he would take away my phone, but because I broke his trust. The night the incident happened I wrote a letter to my dad, saying him that many of my friends talk over the phone for several hours which I couldn't, and told him that my disability made me more far from them when I didn't reply to my friends often. I said him that if he wanted to look at my phone, he was free since I had nothing to hide and I never did anything bad. I told that I had to hide it from him, because he wouldn't approve me texting to friends. Actually when I use to text my friends in front of him, he used to stare at me and occasionally shout at me for texting a lot with my friends with my mom phone during 9 & 10th std. That's why I had developed that mindset, I had to hide from him, he also comes to home early around 6, my school was done by 3, my friends start texting at that time around 6 but I couldn't text them often as my dad used to scold at me for being addicted with the phone. So I had to resort to such measures. I explained everything in that letter, I let him know that I wasn't happy and comfortable of being deaf as I couldn't talk with people over the phone like my friends. It created a distance between me and them. (it's the truth, but now I have found some amazing ones, I am glad that I did.) I apologised in the letter, letting him know that I never wanted to hurt him and that I loved him.The next morning before leaving for school, I told my mom to hand him the letter I had written the previous night. Luckily dad used to get up after I go to school, so I didn't have to face him yet. The whole day I was at school, I couldn't keep my mind away from that, I couldn't focus on studies or my friends. People say when you are away from that place, you will forget about it especially when you are in school, it's not true at all. I was literally waiting for minutes as to when the bell would ring. I even made a call from a P.C.O in school to mom asking her if dad has read the letter, mom told he did, and I asked her what did dad say? Mom told that papa didn't say anything but his face was serious. I was again scared about it. I was dreading it when I reached home. Due to worries and scaredness, I slept off in the room and I was glad, I thought I wouldn't have to face my dad if I was asleep. I had a maid at that time who woke me up in the evening around 6 and told me that my dad told her to wake me up. Shit, I was terrified to the core at that moment. I was looking everywhere for my mom, my mom was like a security blanket for me. Unfortunately I learnt from that maid that my mom had gone to temple at that time. I was trying to send telepathic messages to my mom to return home soon. I made my way to the hall where dad was sitting on sofa and watching cricket in TV. He saw me coming, I sat on the farthest sofa away from him. He told me softly to come and sit next to him, I walked so slowly, I was praying to God to save me. Then my dad explained from his point, he told that it wasn't that late yet, why did I hide it from him. It didn't look good from his point of view. He asked me to see it from his point of view. He told me that I was better off than anyone else, he told me why I thought negatively about being deaf, he said me to be happy with it. He said that he wanted me to gain a good education and be something in my life, he gave me an example that there were millions of poor people who have all parts of body working, and my condition was still better than theirs. He said if I thought like this, how he and my mom also felt then?  Then he told me that if anyone like our relatives or his friends who ever tried to put me down, he broke contact with them. He explained me his struggle of how he came up with his life when he had no money and he became successful, he says me that all he has was 'confidence' and tells me to have it. That day, we understood each other clearly, then my mom entered after everything was done. I smiled at the irony of the situation. After that day, I felt free to text my friends in front of him or late in night also, he understood me and I understood him. That was our first fight, but it was very revealing and helpful about our feelings for each other. I love my dad and mom a lot, they are really awesome. There are lots of stories about them including my mom, but that's for another question and day. And now a days I feel more close with my dad, I could share with him anything. I am glad of our strong relationship (black touch, wood touch :D ) :)Thank you, papa for loving me the way I am and guiding me to be the best I can :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"According to me, if a person has been born from the beginning with any disability, we have a much better chance in coping up with it, since it's all we have known our entire life, and most of the time we feel ourselves leading a normal life. Though not all has the same mindset, everyone have different thoughts and assumptions about it. No one can think the same about it. These disabilities just makes us to lead our lives in a different way which we are comfortable in. Some people feel like they belonged in it, and wouldn't want to change themselves if there are chances to either hear or see. It's because it's a part of the people's identity and he/she feels comfortable in it. Some people might not feel they belonged in it, and they end up getting frustrated with the things they can't do. Some people chose to look at the brighter side of life, and try to live their life to the fullest. Some people just whine and pity themselves. Sorry I got off track, the question was something related to worse for being deaf or blind? My answer would be NO. You could ask me 'why?' Some of my reasons here:-->I am a deaf person, and I am educated. ->I believe that I have many big dreams to fulfil.->I believe that I have god's blessings with me.->I have got amazing supports in the form of my parents, brother, family and friends.->I have their love, care and affections. ->I have shelter, food and home.  ->I have learnt that in order for me to survive, I need to have strong mental strength. ->I learnt that I am good in many other things. ->I learnt a lot more things too.Yes, there are times when I feel so frustrated if I think about the advantages people get when they can hear, and I ask God, ""Why me?"" Yes, I do end up being depressed, but being depressed has given me a more willpower to come out strong. It makes me to work harder. According to me, the worse people are who doesn't have the above stuffs, like no education, or lack of purpose, or faith in God, or parents and others love, or shelter, etc. It just depends on how a person tries to see the world, if they see it from another angle where cons are more than the pros, then he/she feels the worst, or if they see it from the angle where pros are more than the cons, they feel like the luckiest person. So it all lies on the person's mindset. Honest to God, I was one of those people who thought the worse about it, because of people's attitude and I used to feel alone even if I am in a crowd of my favourite people. But slowly, now I am trying to change my mindset, and trying to work towards making me feel better and to love myself. I know deep in my heart, that I am much better than I give credit to myself. So yeah, I am on the path to appreciate myself more (I started it from some months back.), so it's a ongoing journey, and it's a really beautiful journey. I am 'all talk and no action' kind of a person, but lately from past few months, I started doing little stuff like appreciate myself and feel better. I can be a great motivator for others, but I was the harshest critic for myself. Usually if anyone who knew me personally would think I have an awesome life, and I am the happiest person in the whole world. They failed to have a look into my mind and it's thoughts, but from past few months I stopped it and tried to be a good motivator for myself as I realised that I was supposed to be motivating myself not putting myself down, I can honestly tell you it feels so much better and happy. :) So being deaf or blind ( You need someone else to tell you from their perspective, I don't know about their opinions, but so far I think they have the same opinions as mine.) is not the worst thing in the world. :) It can also be called as a blessing in disguise. :P You might say, ""Come on, Shraddha. I get it, it's great about it and all. But please don't really make stuff up or be filmy that it's a blessing in disguise."" Well some of my observations are there, like:- ('You' is for reference if you were a deaf person.)-> You get a great night sleep, no snoring, no sounds, and you can sleep anywhere and anytime even if it's noisy. :P-> You get to escape talking over the phone to all awkward classmates or far relatives you haven't heard of. :D (I have seen many people who feel awkward having to talk over the phone to a lot of people who they don't really know, it's India so everyone have to talk to their 2nd cousin and so on.) -> If you are a lip-reader like me, you can eavesdrop on people's conversations if you know the language they are speaking in. :D (Many friends and cousins and people always ask me to teach them lip-reading as they feel it's a good talent.) -> You will get lots of people's compliments about how you are an inspiration, or how they are amazed about your lip-reading skills, and so on. :D ( I know I sound like a self-centred person but hey get all the flatterings while you can. :P ) -> You can escape from talking to a far relative face to face if you don't know their language, just give a smile and a namaste and go back to whatever thing you were doing. :D -> If you wear hearing aids like me, you can shut it down during the boring lectures or irritating sounds, you can be in your own dream world :D -> You will use your other senses to the fullest, like observing stuffs more clearly (in my case, I can read people's expressions not all though), and feeling even the slightest vibrations. :)-> If you want some excuse to escape the stuff you don't want to do, or if you forgot to do it, just say that you didn't hear when it was said. :P (I know that's so mean or bad, but you gotta admit it, it's a genius idea which could never fail. :P) Many more points are there, but it's enough for now. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Being a hearing impaired girl, I just had to write an answer for this one.Well first of all fantasy and reality are completely different. If you are looking to find a cute and vulnerable girl? You feel that kind of girls is available only in deaf and mute category. I don't know but I feel a bit appalled if that assumption is true. I may not be very pretty or vulnerable, but that doesn't stop me from living my life and enjoying it. I might dream of living a good life with my future partner afterwards but I would make sure that he lets me live my own life comfortably and every couple has to make some adjustments for each other, I might ask him to help me out a bit like letting me know I missed anything, or something like that. I will also make some adjustments for him. No one is perfect, everyone needs to adjust and trust a person.And if that is the qualities of a person you are searching for like 'cute and vulnerable' it's available in many people including in normal hearing people.I don't know but I feel like you want a girl who has low self esteem and low confidence and control her life. You want her to treat you as a prince.Maybe you can't really find a girl with confidence who you can make her like you, you just want to have the upper hand. Sorry for sounding harsh, I just get irritated when people make silly assumptions of people like us. Some people think we are weak, and we need someone to save us. At times we do really feel vulnerable but that everyone whether they have disability or not, goes through it at least once in their life. I have gone through several speech therapy sessions when I was a kid, and so my voice is almost at par with you normal people. And I do have my own dreams and hopes for the future but they are truly realistic.Love the girl for her personality not for her disability, if you tell her that you like her because of her disability it will make her feel that she is really deaf not normal. Everyone of us wants to be normal and we are truly. So let us be normal without the society's talk.",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"I thought it had been banned by now. I feel hurt to know that it still exists out there (I had to surf in the net to find out if it exists out there, sorry I am so clueless to this, I seriously thought it stopped ages ago.) What the hell are these teachers trying to convey to the children both girls and boys? Are they trying to just punish them out there like that, spoiling their innocence, giving them their first taste of humiliation, depression, and what not? This is not the way to lead the life or to guide a child to learn from their mistakes or failures, punishments  like this stops the creativity of the children to become our future leaders. These punishments causes the students to fall sick, and even sometime death (I saw it in newspaper long back, I can't forget it, it was written that it's being banned, so I thought it would be the end of this.) But it's not. People who see these things happening in your place with your own eyes, please try to step up a bit, look at world through their eyes, they are really innocent, they are slowly corrupted because of their experiences in school. Caning, beating, spanking are not allowed at schools, but some still practise this sort of punishments, I can understand the plight of the teachers when the students purposely don't listen. The teachers can use other approach like explaining the student that their studies is the only way which can lead them to have a good life, if the student still doesn't pay attention the teacher can give him extra homework or give detention like in western countries, etc. Murga punishment should be globally banned, and the parents should be aware of this if it's happening to their children and should take the step in protecting their children's innocence.",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Dear ma'am,        Please WAKE UP! You got a job even if it's not that great, but okay according to you. There are many people out there who are unemployed and still you have your own job. That's one reason you should be proud of yourself. You got out of an abusive relationship, kudos to you, you realised that you are important, and special enough to be treated with respect. So that's really great that you got out of it. :) Your parents must be feeling insecure with your brother's relationship with them, that's why they want to please him and his wife. But why do you want them to affect your thoughts, why should you let their insecurity affect your life? You are YOUR own person, love yourself, don't wait for other people to love you. Don't even care about anything, just forget everything that happened. Imagine that you got a new chance to live your life to the fullest, discover your hobbies, laugh out loud for all silly things, learn new things, go out, follow your passion. ""You is KIND. You is SMART. You is IMPORTANT."" I would like to request you to chant those words often whenever you feel down, look at yourself in the mirror and keep repeating those words. Believe in it. As soon as you can save enough to move out, please do it only if your parents doesn't appreciate you as who you are. But I would still suggest you to let them know that you were depressed, and that you need their support, and let them know which ever actions they did hurt you, let them know that they didn't do it intentionally or wantedly, and ask them not to repeat it in the future. But again if they don't get you, then move out when you save enough cash, you don't need to be surrounded by negative people. But don't break your bond with them, even if they aren't supporting you, as once upon a time, they were your parents who loved you and cared for you. Keep in touch but keep it in limits so as to not be influenced by the negative atmosphere surrounding it. For now, try to be patient, love yourself, read positive thoughts and answers, be busy in quora or anything you like. Keep chanting that line, which I mentioned above. I sincerely hope everything goes well for you. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"I couldn't help but try to answer this one. Honestly dear, no one out in the world or is very beautiful neither is ugly. Everyone is really beautiful on their own. I don't think that you are not beautiful, I know you do. It's just the lack of confidence in you, and you haven't really discovered yourself.You look only at the bad sides and that's what life will show you. If you start looking in the good sides especially with your mind and life shows you amazing and a beautiful outcome. Just trust your flow of life, good things come to those who wait. And have faith and don't be desperate. No need to be too flirty or anything else to attract the  guy's attention. Honestly just be yourself, smile a lot (a true smile not simply fake ones), share your thoughts and opinions. Be a good friend, make the first move (maybe the guy is shy to approach to you) Just be yourself and be confident, don't ever put yourself down. It's YOU :)I hope you change your perspective and focus all your energies in something new. Make new friends, learn something new everyday, develop a skill, do anything which makes you happy and proud of yourself. There is a one for you out there who is also clueless like you, might be worried as you, so it's all really fine. Just go with the flow.I hope this answer was what you were looking for. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Well I belong to the latter, it's not because of the looks it's actually because of my shyness to communicate with new people. Personally what I find is looks really don't matter that much, it's just a bonus. The thing which actually really makes a person (both male and female) attractive is the self confidence they possessed, high self esteem, happy and cheerful face, etc which basically screams an amazing personality. :)I hate to admit the truth, I don't really have that kind of self confidence, or high self esteem, etc because of my disability (hearing impaired from childhood). I like to blame it on my disability, which I truly know in my heart that it's not the real reason. I have been an introvert from the young age.I am on my way to gain that confidence and self esteem, etc. But if any situation arises in such a manner where I need to stand up for myself, I never fail to do it. I do have those qualities when it's needed, but I don't possess it for daily and simple purposes. I don't really envy people who are good looking, I envy those people who possess an extremely good self confidence and etc. :)Btw if you offered me the chance to gain attention or not, I would prefer both as I like to be in touch with people who are like minded based on intellect, confident, smart, witty, good sense of humour, not those creeps type or people who are crazy only over looks :) For me inner beauty matters more than outside beauty :PI hope I answered it properly. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Well I am a young person to be answering about this. But as soon as I read your question, I couldn't help but remember myself in your shoes I mean not in a professional way. There are a lot of things I envy my friends and family. My friends can actually hear everything but I can't. My friends find it easy to mingle with anyone but I don't. My friends know at least 3-4 languages minimum but I know only one and that's English. My friends spend a lot of time gushing about music and talk on phone for hours but I can't. My friends and family always talk to each other in other language whenever we are in a group which I always miss out in the conversation. Even if I did my best to fight with hurdles, no one notices my hardwork and efforts, instead they just notice my failures. And the fact is I am doing double work as compared to a normal person ( I am hearing impaired.) but I am put with the same competition as the rest. My friends or cousins always gets approached first for anything, I am always the last person to be picked for anything. My friends can follow their ambitions but I can't. ( I don't mind now, but I am just sharing the situation.) My friends and family have their own faults but no one notice it, but for me everyone notice it. (I can't hear.) Even if I am speaking normally as a normal person, living with a great family, having some good friends, my life is far from perfect. I can't believe I am saying this- but I have even thought it a few times that it would be better for me to be dead than alive. (I have never told anyone that I had such kind of thoughts, but I have never done anything to myself. ) My friends and family are far far better than me, they got everything easy as compared to me. But it's okay, slowly we can come up in life, try to look at that as kind of milestones you want to achieve in life. It will be a heck of struggle, but the day you come out victorious with tears in your eyes, will be the most wonderful moment of your life. Get up from the self-pity, look at yourself in the mirror, keep saying what a great person you are. And  remember all your good qualities. Look at your friends closely see how they did it, and you can do it a better way. Find out other jobs which provides you better pay and which gives you HAPPINESS. Keep working hard. ""Rome was not built within a day."" Without hardwork, nowhere you can come up in life. Keep working hard. Within a day you can't expect to reap your fruits, it may take several months or even years to achieve the place where you want to be. Don't give up, work hard, and you will emerge victorious. :) Good luck!",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"As an Indian girl, I was supposed to be cooking all delicious dishes, and maintaining the house beautifully etc by now. I am 18 years old now, I have started my college just a month back. (To give you an idea of the situation.) My cousin sister who is just 12-13 years old can make delicious dishes, and have an idea on how to run the house. All my lady relatives, my grandparents, and even my dad used to pester my mom to teach me all these. My mom used to take their numerous advices from many years- the year I became 13-14, my mom never forced me to prepare food or to learn about household works. I used to have that mentality that why should I learn this stuff in such a young age, I was going to learn when it was needed, at least by college time. My mom used to request me to learn how to cook, to clean up the home when it's messy and all. I used to simply nod my head as I knew she would leave the topic after a while, as I have heard several times the same lecture. She told me that everyone is forcing her to teach me all these stuff, but she doesn't as she believes that the time will come where I will willingly learn it and love the work what I am doing. I used to scoff when she told me that the time would come where I will love to do these stuff. As I never believed that I would ever love it. My mom was worried that I would be too late, as she tells that she also learnt late as she was pampered in her family as she was the youngest child there. I used to be like ""Ma, I will learn it one day.""Although I did learn a couple of things like - preparing tea, sandwiches, Maggi, rice, dal, rotis, over the years. But I take a long time to prepare rotis, and I am not confident of my cooking skills. That's what my mom wants me to improve on, and she wants me to learn more cooking skills. I had my vacations time last month, so we visited to my paternal grandmother's place which is in Hyderabad. I have cousins there also. So while we were watching TV, my chachu (father's younger brother) 2 daughters were younger than me aged 16 and 14 respectively. The elder daughter was cleaning the house, while the younger daughter was preparing delicious paneer butter masala vegetable and my Chachi was talking over the phone, she didn't even ask her daughters to do the work. The daughters did it themselves, so I was incredibly jealous of them. I felt bad at that moment as I realised that my mom never was treated in that way as their mother was treated as like a queen. So I said the dialogue to my younger cousin sister, "" Chachi is lucky to have you guys, you cook delicious foods, and guddu (elder sister) manages the house. I don't even know how to do anything."" I gave a giggle at the end to remove the weird feeling and awkwardness. My mom heard it, and as soon as she opened her mouth, I was prepared to hear the comparisons between me and the cousins and how I should be more like them. But what she said with a huge smile on her face, I was surprised ""Shraddha, it's no problem. I will handle the household works, and the maid will handle cooking, and you focus on your studies, nothing else and become something in life. I will be the proudest person and you will be the best."" I was on top of the world at that moment, I was glad that my mom supported me on my journey for studies, she didn't even pester me to learn about these stuff. My cousins didn't like studies as much I did. You know what, the time I wanted to learn these stuff without any one influence like my mom said, has finally happened to me just a few days back and is still going on. My mom and dad are seriously happy now, they are kinda over the moon.There are many other incidents, this is the recent one. :) Mothers are the best, no matter what. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Other people who have supplied the answers are more better than what I am going to say to you.It's just my own opinion what I feel is: you don't love yourself, you don't accept that you did do the success, you automatically feel that you suck in everything, you feel like no one can get you, you feel that your life is the worst. It's just my opinion. You didn't have proper upbringing from your parents when you were younger, maybe that's why you have this kind of perspective and attitude towards life. Change your attitude, love life and embrace it. You are really fortunate to have a family, success, job. There are millions of people who lack those stuff. See your wife with new eyes, never take her for granted, smile often and talk to her and let her know what's going on, I am sure she will be by your side and support you.I don't remember if you have kids, if you do, please spend some time with them, learn more about them, try to be better than your parents ever were, they might feel like you in their later stages of life, surround them with positivity and cheerfulness. You automatically will feel lighter and happy when everyone is happy. Spend some time aside to learn yourself, maybe you do have flaws but it's okay no one is really perfect. Accept those flaws and embrace your good and bad points. And believe that you are indeed lucky. If you have a lot of money, share some with poor people and orphanages. Spend some time with them, their smiles will really lit up your heart. You will know what life means and how important it is.About friends, go join something new which you have always wanted to try and make some new ones there :) Honestly once your attitude towards life and yourself changes into positive, automatically people will be attracted to your personality. Please develop your communication skills with those family members, friends, co workers who actually mean something to you, let them know that you are in a dark place and trying to come of it. They will support you, and if not then you know you are better off without them. Meditate for some minutes everyday, make someone smile everyday, have some gratitude and thank the God or universe for the things you have. And for that sex addiction or anything other addiction try to look for counselling and get some help and truly follow it. Please think from your wife side how she would feel if she knew that. I know you can overcome everything, but you are the only one who can actually turn this all around. All the best for everything, and good luck :) I hope that this answer was some help :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"I couldn't help but feel emotional while writing this. I and my brother have a huge age gap 9-10 years gap, I thought that we wouldn't be close at all and I am the elder sister here. I am 18 and my brother is now 8. Some of my favourite incidents:- (Before reading these incidents, my brother doesn't say or show his feelings about me openly.  Being the elder sister I am kind of bossy sister, I also don't show my feelings openly. ) -> When he was around 6 years, from that time we use to have opposite personalities. He used to be outspoken, naughty, playful, and not studious at all. The only things we were similar at being left handed and artistic. He used to have all building friends over several times. In front of them he used to argue with me about silly things which made me to pull my hair literally, I can remember how mad I used to become, but as his friends were there I had to control myself from blasting at him. It seems that in front of me, he fights like hell with me. But when I am not there he praises about me to his friends about my studies, my achievements and all which he just give me a normal look or a shrug when I show him my achievement or anything. I was surprised when I heard that he did through my mother eavesdropping on their conversation and that he knows about what I have achieved. -> My brother from day one he used to talk to other people be it family or friends or cousins or anyone, if he ever talks about me, he says ""MERA Didi ....."" (My sister..) I was the only own sister and everyone knew me but he always emphasised ""my "". I didn't believe when my mother told me this, the next day I paid attention to his conversations with the others he did used ""MERA Didi.. "" specifically. I was overjoyed. -> I am a huge novel fan, my brother knew that even when he was so young. One day randomly I asked him what he was going to get for my birthday gift ( I was joking as I knew he couldn't) he just told my mom in her ears to get some novels and wrap it up nicely and give it to me. I was surprised when my mom told me this, my brother didn't tell me as he wanted it to be a surprise. I didn't get that gift from him, but I was really touched that he knew me so well and that he thought about what gifts to buy as to what I did like, he listed a couple of my favourite accessories like watches and others, I only told him I wanted different thing. I never ever thought he would think about my novels. He used to make fun of me reading novels. -> When ever we go out with family without our parents, my brother refuses to go anywhere without me. He always asks if I am going and then only he does. And the biggest happiness is that he actually listen to me when our parents are not around and doesn't do silly or dangerous things. -> If he goes out anywhere to buy anything with my mom, if he buys any eatables for him he never fails to get something for me, in fact he reminds mom to get something for me.-> I used to dream about being an architect, but I had to change that dream (another story). Architect was pretty tough for a small child age 6 or 7 to understand about it. My mom asked him that what he wanted to become in future, he replied quickly architect. My mom was surprised that how he knows the word, she asked him again, ""Architect?"" He replied, ""Shraddha Didi is doing that."" My mom was surprised and just smiled. I was touched and I asked him if he knew what architect was all about. He did and he explained with a look that he was caught in following my footsteps and he smiled so broadly. I couldn't help but kiss his forehead. (That dream I gave up for a new and better one.) -> We had a language barrier, he used to speak in Hindi full time and I used to speak in English full time. He use to try his best to talk to me in English and I with him in Hindi. Our conversations were really hilarious. He doesn't know or show that he knows that I am hearing impaired. He is the one who I feel happy with actually, he pisses me off, hurts me, fights with me, doesn't give a care about anything else, but he loves me and care for me. He is the only one who I feel safe and secure about my disability as he seriously don't even show me a hint of my difference like others. (Language barrier is because I learnt only one language to talk and listen- English, but as all others my brother was normal and he picked up our actual mother tongue- Hindi and so that's why. I couldn't learn Hindi at that time as it was difficult to even learn a language, but now I am working on my Hindi language. ) -> Usually when friends come over and they meet the siblings they ask the sibling of the respective friend that their siblings (friends) were bad, and the sibling would agree to their sibling friends. But in my case, my friends asked my brother, that I was bad girl, my brother was nervous and shook his head no. I was surprised as I expected him to say yes to them as we always fought like hell. My friends were also amused and surprised. That's all I can remember for now, and I do love my brother like crazy but he still irritates me a lot. But I guess that's what small brothers are there for :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Honestly, at first you can only just wait for the person to finish their lies. Then if that person never really lied to you in the past, it might be something he/she is afraid to share the truth with you. Just let them know politely but firmly that you know the truth. Ask them gently what made them to lie to you, and try to keep an open mind. If that person has never done it to you before, it's possibly that he/she feels scared of sharing the truth with you as it feels that your relationship with them will be damaged. If their reasons were really valid and true for lying, give them another chance and let them know that they should always feel free to come to you without any judgements. Ask them not to do it again, let them know that you really value them and don't want to lose your trust in them based on such tiny stuff.If that person lies often, just break your relationship with them. It's really not worth it. Tell them that you are done with their shit, and are tired of such stuff. Tell them to grow up and not to take you for granted.  Tell them if they are really important in your life that until they mend up this habit of theirs, your contact with them is done.",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"I don't know exactly the answer you are asking for. Let me see from my own point of view, I have been hearing impaired from birth, I have a pair of hearing aids and can talk almost clearly as you people. With the help of hearing aids, I can actually hear the water sounds, the fan sounds and all those sounds. The problem is I don't know where exactly the sound is coming from, I can hear a person speaking but if I don't look at their lips I would be lost. I can hear their sounds but the clarity of the words I don't have it. If I miss anything it's not being able to talk to a person over the phone, or watching a movie without subtitles,or enjoy the lyrics of music.I have been surrounded by hearing people all my life, so that's why I know what I am missing out. If I wasn't I probably wouldn't have known.I have learnt to be happy with what I have. I do have difficulties and moments of depressions, but it's okay. It's life. I have really got an amazing support from the people in my life, that's good enough for me. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Hi there :) I just glanced at your question and so I couldn't wait to answer this one. Well I am hearing impaired and living in India. So I know where you are coming from, according to me it's really important that you continue your studies further and it is really very helpful in life. ( I am just starting my college now.)If you study in the area of your interest, it will make you knowledgeable and experienced in that area, and help you score some high and great jobs. But I am not going to lie to you about this, you need a load of patience, hard work, faith, and confidence in the journey. There will be loads and loads of obstacles in the way, but you will have that inner strength that will help you come out victorious. If you are hardworking and good at what you do, it won't be difficult to secure a job that you want. Believe that we all are equal and talented enough to go for our dreams and seize it :) I believe that there must be some quota specially for hearing impaired/deaf people in companies and government jobs to employ us, so you can go that way also. These all were just my opinions, I hope I was helpful. All the best, good luck with your future and I hope all your dreams become fulfilled :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"The other people who posted the answers are also good, so do follow their advice if you like it. :) Well from your explanation, it sounds you got a good life, but you are bored and lonely. You haven't really discovered yourself really. You are just surrounded by people and stuff, you can't embrace the peace just by being with yourself. You are your own best friend and your worst enemy. My suggestions would be: explore yourself, find out what makes you happy by doing stuff, what really interest you, your hobbies. Change your lifestyle, try to wake up earlier, improve your personality, strengthen your intelligence by reading newspapers and watching news or just learning about anything which interests you, do meditation for a while it will help you a lot- especially your moods. Do anything you like- playing video games, or sports, or music, or anything else which makes you happier. :) Learn about yourself, love yourself the way you are, and keep on improving your personality. There is no full stop in life, it still goes on whether you like it or not. You must be missing those happy memories you spent with your loved ones, but you have to move on.  It's life, and believe me- there are a lot of opportunities out there waiting for you to embrace them and explore. You have a lot more memories yet to make. So go ahead with a smile and live your life to the fullest. :) One more suggestion, if you can't do all the above I mentioned or don't want to. Just focus on making a person smile everyday whether it be a close one or a stranger. Knowing that you made them smile, will brighten up your day better :) You can also do volunteering for teaching poor people or physically handicapped or anything else if you want, personally I feel this is the best suggestion, your entire life will be much better. You will embrace people close to you, your life, your family, everything. You will also discover yourself along in the way. :) I hope I helped you out a bit. :) Good luck with your life, smile :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Hmm, this question had me thinking, what exactly we hearing impaired people might actually be good at? Well, in response to your question, I agree with the other person that we do develop strong vision power, that's because we rely on our other senses. Personally I feel that there is no specific talents that all hearing impaired people possess. It's just like asking what are people (hearing) good at? Your answer would be like people are different, and they are good at different things, well there you got your answer here. Take example of me, I feel that I am good at art and hopefully at writing. My one hearing impaired friend is good at sports specifically badminton, he is a state player, he is aiming to be a national player, it makes me proud of his achievements. ( I have no athletic bone in my body, lol :D) :) Other one is good at making people feel at ease, okay in playing the piano (not that great but enough to be said good at especially if she is hearing impaired since its sound related stuff), dance (she is an extrovert, I am the opposite of her :D ), everyone is unique and are good at some fields. :)But we people, yes we may have some universally talent, that's reading lips, those who have been taught orally :D One more universal talent is we can read a person face and expression, that's our talent since we put stress on our other senses, so we can figure it out :) I hope I answered your question correctly :D",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"I would do nothing, just do my usual routine, and be the same as usual. So as not to create a fuss or anything, just be in peace. I have a lot of me- time, so they won't worry as to what I am doing. I would prepare letters for ->my mom- let her know that I love her from road to sky (when I was a kid, I used to say that dialogue to her, it's a beautiful memory), tell her that I was the happiest person to be her daughter, I would be meeting her later, and to live her life happily as I would be watching her from above and to be strong for dad and my brother, tell her to donate my organs to the people whichever is possible. -> my dad- let him know that I love him, and that I admire him the most and tell him that I know he loves me even if he doesn't say, for giving me everything I have ever wanted, tell him don't feel guilty or upset for not being able to save me this time (he is very overprotective of me) and to be strong for mom and my brother,->own brother- I would say him that he is the world best brother I could ever have (I don't say that to him as he's naughty and playful and very small than me), I would tell him that I will not miss any of his achievements whether small or big, I will always be watching out for him, take care of our parents and now it's his responsibility and that I love him to bits. ->closest cousin - I would apologise for our first fight which is really silly but it was our only fight. I would tell her to move on, that I am happy. Let her know that she filled my childhood with beautiful memories, and tell her that I love her a lot. That she was my first childhood best friend. I would tell her to take care of my parents and my brother- make him to feel that he still have a sister with him. To please write in my wattpad account that I am incredibly blessed to have amazing readers out there, and that I love them, and then tell them that I am following my other dreams not writing. (Don't ever let them know that I won't be alive.) obviously I would give her my password and username. I will tell her not to delete it, as it was my first work even if it was so lame at least somewhere people can read it even if I am no more. ->school best friends (together) - tell them thanks for believing in me, helping me out and I love them to bits. Tease them for a while, and tell them to follow their dreams, and write some good memories of us, and tell them to move on. I will be still there watching them smile and achieve their dreams. ->college new friends (together)- thank them for welcoming me to a new college atmosphere, tell them it was great knowing them, and I wish I could have known them much better. Tell them that I love them, and thanks for helping me out and for having fun. Tell them to smile and follow their dreams. and my Nani home relatives (together), dadi home relatives (together) - I love each and everyone, I would miss them and every single memories shared with them. I got the best family. It would be around 30-45 mins. I would then go through my old photographs and achievement and smile through them. It would be 10 mins. I will lie down in the bed with closed eyes and a smile on my face, where I would hold a god photo with me as I would pray for the last time. Tell God, thanks for giving me a beautiful life on Earth, and can't wait to meet him soon. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Your question is my life story basically. Well I am deaf from birth and I have some sharp brains. I mean I am smart, but not to that great extent as I would like to be. Well it all depends on how is the child raised when they were really young. For example: When I was just two-three years old, my parents found a great school that helped me to speak and listen with the help of hearing aids. I am not going to lie and say that I picked up everything as soon as I received my hearing aids and joined that school, it is the complete opposite. It seems my mother had to keep conversing with me the entire day at school and at home. Obviously as a deaf child I never replied yet, my mom used to cry a lot but not in front of me. The teachers at that school used to scold my mother for not making efforts as I wasn't talking yet. It took more than five months of joining that school and my mom hard efforts, I finally spoke those words ""Keep it there."" for something I asked mom to do in the playground. My mom was very happy and she got hope back, after that day my mom did double hard work and never gave up. It is because of my mother and father I am the person I am today :) I will try to explain the process on how they try to teach us to learn. In the school they encourage talking, and they talk in a bit louder voice, and there was only one language- English. They keep on talking for every single thing, even if they was taking a pen, just to make us realise how words are formed and pronounced and what it indicated. They used to give assignments for parents, it's like my mom has to teach me new three - four lines daily. And I had to show the assignment at school and explain what my mom had taught me the previous day. And the same system followed in school also, teachers taught us three four lines daily and then we had to explain them to our parents. We learnt reading, speech therapy, mathematics, listening, and dictation words. I have made some pretty good friends there. And there was an individual teacher for 4-5 children. They taught us up to preschool level, after that I could join into a normal school from first standard and further. Now I have found my passion in art, and hoping to be good at writing. I got good scores too on my results with the normal people level. (Like school topper in maths and English olmpaid, a couple of art prizes, and a couple of rank prizes in the younger classes, 9.8 cgpa in tenth std and 90% in twelfth std.) These all I achieved in a normal school with normal people not a special school. It was all because of that special school, my mom hard work and efforts, and dad support, I can say that I am normal and happy now. I hope that I explained it clearly. Our disabilities can't stop us from being bright and anything we want to be in our lives. So who ever have any sort of disability, work hard and never ever give up. There will always be struggles and obstacles on the way to success, be strong and have faith to overcome that. Have confidence in you and believe in yourself. :) You can actually achieve anything in life :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Thanks for my first A2A :)Honestly I don't really have much idea about this. But hey there are a lot which they lie to the public like advertisements promoting fairness,or attraction with the opposite sex, or even those forwards where if you forward the message you get that much amount, or even those random pops up where you happen to be a lucky winner. But yes face to face it also happens in the form of our government, before they are elected they give out lots of promises like they will give food, shelter or improve the lifestyles or do something for our country and after they are elected, they might do just one month of that promise but after that they don't really do anything. They just like to be in power, and I am not talking for those who are really good ones, they are there but it's very rare to find them though, I know it's hard to believe them :)Oh and one more thing, they say either in movies some random dialogues which make a girl or guy fall in love and that too within a second, that's not really true. Yes, this male - female differences: physically they are different, but mentally wise they are same, everyone has their own dreams, hopes, feelings, choices. I really don't like people who automatically just assume that it should be make dominated area or country. Females too are talented maybe even more, they also have some brains, they are not weak, they certainly know how to lead their lives happily and know their strengths. It's not true that only males are earning members of the society, even females do it. And yeah the society have a mental mindset that people who have disabilities are a liability and don't have futures. I am sorry to disappoint the public on this one, I am one, specifically hearing impaired. If people say that deaf people cannot hear and talk, sorry I got to disappoint you there, I can talk almost clearly at par with you guys, yes I can't listen perfectly as you guys can but I do hear the tiny sounds like fans spinning etc, and I do lip-reading also. And I have lots of dreams and hopes for my future and it's realistic too. It's a lie that people say to others and make the others also develop a narrow mind set about people like us. If you are one of those people, meet me in real life and then you try to find the difference between you and me. I have come across people who feel that I am different, but I successfully disappoint them for their false beliefs :D When they say that an actor or actress uses the product, it's not true at all :D I don't really remember more points right now, when I will, I will add it later. Sorry if my answer was harsh or sounded angry or lame I just needed to let it out my points across :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Well, I am assuming that the girl is your close friend, a person who is close to you. Tell her that it might not be very worse as she feel it might be, tell her that some hope might be there, does she have any quota by chance (I don't have one, just asking if she did, she would have much brighter chances than she feel so.) If she does, tell her that she has a lot of chances if not, tell her it's not the end of the world yet. There are a lot more things out there, there is something better waiting for her out there. Maybe it wasn't her time now, but later she would realise that it was just a stepping stone for her success. And the most important thing tell her that the result doesn't define her at all. She is smart and intelligent. If you know her result, and she didn't get good one, tell her that the college lost a talented girl, it sucks for the college. Maybe it will make her smile a bit. If you do try this line, let me know the outcome :)Sorry I cracked my mind, thinking of some good answers for this one but I couldn't really find a perfect one.

Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Hey there, I get you. :) Okay whatever you have described about yourself, I too have the same personality, I can never be a complete girly girl, nor can bitch about someone. I dont gossip much (my gossip is only knowing about who is who. I don't know if that is defined as gossip.)That's really better, I am not trying to flatter you, it's the truth. It's actually a great way to be happy and truly be ourselves, not like a fake exterior just to impress the people. It's very rare to find a genuine one, and when you do, those people are always there for you in your lifetime. I have a couple of friends who also belong to the same category as Us and I am glad to say that my life is beautiful in that way. I can be who I actually am :) And those people who are 'girly girl' and gossip may have a great social life but in reality they have a load of dramas, which isn't really great to have in our life.

Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"I am no expert in this field, but all I can say it happens to me quite a bit. Some times, our minds are still conscious when we dream while we are still sleeping, and so when we wake up, we remember the best part of the dream or the worst part of the dream. Its actually our sub-conscious mind which does most of the dreaming. Most of our dreams usually involves our true desires, hopes, fears, tensions.The dreams might be more entertaining than our usual routine, and so when we wake up, we can't really wait to continue that dream and be lost in that world.Or even if we happen to wake up before knowing the ending on how the dream turns out to be, we try all our options of the ending.If its an horror and scary dream, if it was me dreaming that, I would like to dream that it got a good ending. Lol :DIt depends on the persons where their interests lies on, and it triggers our conscious mind to think the way the dream is supposed to finish. Its usually when those dreams are really amazing or scary or something really picked up your interest about it.We actually recollect those recent dreams when we wake up. We are sleeping lightly at that moment, our conscious mind is also activated at that time and hence that's why we remember the dreams of morning if we wake up at that time.As I said above if the dream has your favorite stuff like your hopes, dreams, desires, or fears, or its unfinished, you end up trying to dream further than that when you are awake. When we like something, we don't want to let it go. We feel at peace with it, we would like to be in our own world for a bit more and be happy. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"You haven't been specific in your question, is it often or rarely, or it happened recently or from long back, or a one time thing or its naturally like that for you, or is it only for some specific persons or all (notice this one, I feel that you might not shiver with some people) According to me, I feel that is because you are nervous, shy and afraid of what the other people of the conversation think about you. Again it's just my own observation, or maybe you don't have a good command over the language while you speak, you struggle to use the right words you are trying to convey your message across. If you are nervous or shy or afraid of their opinions, all I can say you is they are actually in the same position but they don't show it and they got good practise and experiences. Every experience can not be the same and all the people are not same, you can't try to please everyone.If you struggle with the use of words, try to speak often as you can even if you are slow and nervous, remember the proverb ""Practise makes a man perfect."" Slowly you will get there and be confident. Your question wasn't really specific, I tried to answer with what I thought you tried to ask .

Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Dear, I couldn't help myself when I read this question, I was interested in knowing the answers for this one. I skimmed this page, but couldn't really find an helpful one. So instead I will tell you guys some tips what I do when I study for exams. Please don't copy my tips, if you do, it's your own risk, I'm not responsible for it :PIf you are anything like me, who procrastinate a lot before starting studying, then this one might suit you. Before starting study, tell yourself, it's okay to remember what you can, don't get frustrated if you can't remember exactly at least get the idea of this topic is about (By topic I am referring to the studies what ever topic you are studying for exams).And again if you do study in the last minute, tell yourself you got the whole night to burn and you can sleep comfortably after the exam is done. Do this only when you are tensed and not yet prepared :PFor motivation, this sure is an useful one: if you are not in the mood to study, try to visualize your results getting announced: with both scenarios if you study properly now, how much you will get and your parents reaction (if you are an Indian, you will know what I mean.) The other scenario if you don't study now, then the marks you receive will not be your desired marks and your parents reaction :P This one always works in India :DI hope I answer it as much I could, if I get some more good ones, I  will definitely share it here :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"These are just my own opinions and thoughts.1) First of all, don't depend on other people's image of you, try to see yourself with your own eyes. If you can't do that, try to look yourself as a new person who you have just met and learn all about you all over again.2) Learn to love yourself as you are. 3) Pamper yourself a little every day, as you really would like to be, not on the other people's choices, but your own :)4) Notice all the tiny things which almost goes unnoticed by others including you about your likes, dislikes. Try to find out what are those and make changes accordingly :) For example, if a person offers me some kind of fancy traditional sweet, I used to have an uneasy feeling, but I end up eating that sweet and regretting it later. I learnt that if I didn't like doing that activity, and I started using the word 'No'. It makes me happier now :)5) For the sake of some people desires, never sacrifice your own dreams.6) If anything might make you feel guilty later, stop doing that activity or  lose contact with that person who is not really a good influence in your life.7) Meditate just for a few minutes every day. You will be in peace. :)8) Laugh out loud every day without fail. :D 9) Make at least one person smile every day. :) (I hope that I made you smile now. Lol :D )10) Pick up something which you have always wanted to do, but never had the chance to.11) Live your life every day as though each day is your last day. :)12) Let your loved ones know how much you meant to them, share your feelings with them.If I get any more points to add, I will edit it later :) I hope it helped you a bit :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"I couldn't help myself but smile sheepishly while reading this question and decided to answer this one :)As all humans, I do possess a couple of fears. (couple sounds really less :P)For now I will share only one fear of mine that is being in a dark room. For most of you people it's nothing, but as a hearing impaired person from childhood I do rely on light to read a person's lips. I never used to go for night stay in my cousins home wherever it might be, even if I used to go, I would put a condition that there should be at least a small light to be on when we sleep. If they agreed only I went for a night stay. I never thought of sleeping in the dark ever, I used to get that feeling my heart stop pounding, like someone is crushing my heart and soul, I feel numb, I feel like crying without tears. The same feeling occurs for me when there used to be power cuts especially at nights. It made me feel weak, and vulnerable. I used to fear that I couldn't hear if a person tried to kidnap or kill me if they come to my home, I wouldn't be able to protect myself, I used to be scared of Devils and ghosts (this one is from being a kid) :D I used to be upset that I couldn't have night talks with anyone in the dark, I felt like I was missing out on something.I realised that I needed to overcome that fear, I wasn't a child anymore, and many children could sleep without light (hearing people, I have no clue about hearing impaired ones). I tried it when we had to stay somewhere with our huge family elsewhere and there wasn't possible to have a light on. And I always had something with me a portable light lamp. That's how scared and terrified I was of the dark. I encouraged myself to sleep in the dark by the following points, that I have a light lamp near me, if anything happens to me I can press it on. I realised that ghosts and devils weren't real, even if they were, God is there with me (I believe in God from the childhood.) About those night talks, I ignored them, if I needed to talk to them about something I could before the light is off. I can't have everything, maybe it's not really that great as I hope so. Now a days, I sleep with the light off. I got used to it, and I still have a tiny fear for that but it's better than before. I am happier now. I thought I would never overcome it but I did. :)For those thieves, killers, and kidnappers, if I feel it's there I could just scream and other people can be awake and help me out, that was another solution I came up with :DSorry for my lame answer, I hope it answered your question :D",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"This question indeed had me pondering quite a while, I felt unsure whether to reply this one. But someone asked me to answer this one, I couldn't try to avoid it.I am just going to start my college now, I haven't yet have an experience in doing some job, so that's why I couldn't think how I could answer this one.Like Anki Sarkar answered, that people should do jobs according to their own interests, but if they don't they could try to put some time aside for their interests. I agree with it totally, have some interests, you need to be happy in your life :) (Sorry I don't yet know how to tag a person in Quora.)Like Nikita Gupta answered, keep reminding yourself why you need the job (not want) is actually very true. To help you further, write a list of pros and cons even the tiny details. You will see that the pros overcome than the cons. Write the pros in a paper stick in post thing, and stick it in your workplace- desk where you can see it often to be motivated.Keep some rewards like you could have your favorite food (try to avoid eating that till you complete your task) after two days of proper work completing all tasks in time, or other rewards like buying an novel, or anything else what ever interests you. :)If you are not motivated by it, surf in internet, look up at people who has been in the same shoes as you, read their blogs for inspiration.Thanks for the A2A, I hope my answer helped you a bit :)",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"Well mine is a funny experience. I did come across the quora site many times in Google for finding some answers, but never found it useful as they always asks us to sign up before we can read it further. So I didn't like the site, as I thought it wasn't great enough that's why they needed more users for the website. I ignored this website. Then one day I just chatted randomly with a random guy, he used to praise about quora and specifically he told me that there was a lady who inspired him and others here, that is none other than Virali Modi. :) So one day, out of curiousity to know this lady who inspired everyone here, I signed up and visited her profile and read some of her answers and became inspired by her. And then I downloaded the app in my phone, as it was my vacations time, I didn't have anything better to do. So I surfed here and explored the many and diverse questions over here, some answers were incredibly beautiful. I became officially 'addicted' to quora. :PI upvoted many answers, and initially I thought not to answer to any question as I thought it would be better to have that 'anonymity' tag. But one question kind of provoked me and the comment of someone was just writing based on their assumptions and not actually being deaf, it wasn't true- her perspective (I am not mad at her, but I just wanted to correct hers and every others perspective of us. She did change her perspective though :) ). And so I began writing an answer for his question, and I tried my best to make the others see the actual truth. After that experience, there was no looking back, if I knew the answer then I would try my best to write an answer for it :) P.S: The guy that introduced me to quora is here, and he has no clue that I joined here. I am not in touch with him though.",mid,mid,low,low,high
Shraddha-Agarwal-9,"This question sums up my thoughts process. :) Yes, I used to be hard on myself, I used to be the worst critic for myself. The funniest part is, I used to try to motivate the others around me, and they feel really good when I motivate them. I used to envy them on achieving their targets even when I was the one who motivated them. That's when I realised that I need to be the same kind of motivator for myself. The person who I should be kind to is to myself. That's the first and foremost lesson to everyone out there- appreciate yourself first then only appreciate others. No, this cannot be confused as arrogant, or self-centred, or egoistic, or proudy, or any other word. Keep this in mind, ""No one is perfect."" Keep chanting it as long as you get this sentence through your head. It will calm down all your pressures atleast upto an extent. After you relax after realising that above line, appreciate yourself, say a few lines like ""I love you"", ""You is kind."", ""You is beautiful."", ""You is important."", ""You is smart."" to yourself in a mirror, it feels awkward at first, but you feel better after it, and after many days you get used to it and you realise it's true. :) Whenever you fail in any activity or stuff, just smile at yourself and say it to yourself, ""Atleast I came till here,"" remember all your other achievements and rejuvenate yourself. If possible go back, try out again in whatever you failed at with a more positive attitude. I am sure you will succeed in it along with a happy nature around you. :)",mid,mid,low,low,high

Medha-Bansal,"Okay, I thought about this at the time I first saw the episode. And the first thought that crossed my mind was this is what distinguishes Frank Underwood from Harvey Specter(sorry Suits lovers, but Harvey had been bothering me for quite some time at this point of time) who's usually portrayed as some sort of demi-god with the magical solution to all legal problems.Apart from going along with the story, where Frank is taken aback by the unexpected confidence of Marty Spinella and his sudden accusation, Frank's poor performance also had a veiled motive.He's shown to be mortified by his response when he watches the re-runs.This, I think, was a smart move by the makers to show that the character we assume to always be in-control and prepared, too has his flaws and imperfections .This concept, I presume, is taken even further in the following episodes and the next season, where many of Frank's plans backfire and create situations of extreme duress for him. He's also shown to many times leave things to take their own course(while still trying to regulate as much as he can) and then act accordingly.I think this is where the beauty of the character lies, in not being perfect, not always having control over all possible situations and being his ruthless, undeterred self nevertheless.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"This EXACT thing happened to me. Last year. While I was buying coffee from my college cafeteria.A little back story. I go to an all girls' engineering college, however we share our campus with two other institutions, both of which are co-educational. Hence, the presence of boys on campus.So back to story, I was buying coffee for myself while my friends were waiting for me a little distance away. As I looked up, I saw this dashing (yeah!) guy walking up straight towards the canteen from a distance. He looked suspiciously headed towards me and was smiling all the while he walked up. He came right upto me, said ""I think you are beautiful!"" in this most amazing voice, smiled a killer smile, stood there for a sec and went back the exact same way. It all happened so fast that I couldn't register it properly. I was only beginning to half smile, when all my friends had already rushed up to me. They asked me what the guy said, and I told them.Their first reaction was that it might obviously have been a bet or a dare. I was still thinking slow, while their minds were running at double the usual. So two of them instantly went the way the guy had gone, to trace his gang and check if our speculations were true.They returned to report that the guy was sitting alone outside his library .After deliberating a little more, we seemed to be going nowhere and the conversation moved to another topic, leaving me secretly smug and wishful. I had just received a wonderful compliment from a pleasant (seemingly harmless) stranger, who didn't ask for anything in return and that had left me feeling warm and happy.That's where I thought I left it.But my friends had other plans. They did not intend to let me forget the incidence that easily and every time I passed the guy on campus, or he passed me, they ended up singing James Blunt's ""You're beautiful"" at the top of their voices. This went on for almost two weeks, and needless to say was embarrassing as hell.So what I did was tell my friends what had just happened. What I thought is pretty irrelevant as my friends were already thinking for me by then. And what I felt was warm happiness at having been complimented, followed by extreme embarrassment for the following 15 days :)",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"A person with a twisted sense of humor is assumed to have a not so conventional approach towards appreciating humor in things and situtations. They tend to find funny such situations which do not go down well with most people, and which some may even deem disgusting. In simple words, they laugh at, as well as make jokes which others don't find funny and hence, their jokes aren't usually appreciated.Topics inducing humor for people having a twisted sense of humor may include blood, gore, traumatic events, sexual twists to perfectly innocent statements,racism,personal remarks, deep sarcasm or pure stupidity.Some examples of such twisted jokes are as follows:One particular gem that emerged on my Facebook feed after the tragic death of few engineering students in India, who died in an accident during a road trip.""Oh, four IITians died in a car crash.That's four engineers less.""If you laughed at any of the above, consider yourself part of the pack. You finally know why no one laughs at your jokes.However sometimes, having a twisted sense of humor may also be used as a friendly expression, in casual conversations, for a person whose jokes no one seems to understand.Disclaimer: The images posted above are purely for the purpose of illustration.

Medha-Bansal,"Okay, so you are getting down at 7:30 in the morning.Well there are a number of interesting things you can do.The first, of course being getting out of the mad chaos at the station.For starters, you can eat at Comesum. It's a chain of 24*7 restaurants, which are spread across Delhi, mainly for the convenience of people travelling at odd hours. Nizamuddin has arguably one of the best and oldest outlets. I know of people who specially plan night outs so they can go eat there, or maybe it's the other way round. But definitely worth a shot. And of course, nothing to lose since it is located right outside the station.Then, if you are spiritually inclined, there's the Dargah of Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya after which the station has been named. It's pretty close by, if you want to remain in the close perimeter of the station. You can also visit the Humayun's Tomb, also within the same perimeter. The compound is scenic, but has practically nothing more to offer.A little farther off, but still within a 15-minutes-to-Nizamuddin-Station bracket are the Delhi Zoo and the Old Fort. The former is fun, but the latter is an absolute delight, what with the beautiful compound, compelling fort and a host of water related activities(boating,water zorbing..last time I went) at the lake within the compound.Visiting these would more enjoyable if you have company though.And last, but certainly not the least, the nearest metro station, at a 20 bucks auto ride, is the Pragati Maidan Metro Station.If you are comfortable travelling by the Metro, or a quick learner, then the sky is the limit for you, as the Metro can take you practically anywhere in Delhi. However there are times when the metro has technical issues and travelling too far is not advisable. My nearest suggestion would be Connaught Place(or Rajiv Chowk) which at just three Metro stations(approximately 8 minutes) away, is probably your best bet at getting a great feel of Delhi, and a great time of course. It is one of the biggest cultural and commercial hubs of Delhi.So that's my 2 cents. Being a Delhi lover, I really hope you have a good time. And I definitely hope I was more helpful than the dude before ;)",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"The most part of my life has been spent in Delhi, which is often referred to as the Crime Capital of the country, and for good reasons I must say. So forgive me if I sound a little too sour. And though it may not be as bad in other parts, I'm pretty sure my contemporaries will still have a lot to tell.Let me reconstruct a day in the life of a Delhi girl for you. Not generalizing, but trying to speak from experience. I'm sure you'll find the answer to your question here.It's a normal working day, you're heading out of your home to college. You stand outside your apartment gate and wait for a rickshaw. School boys and daily wage workers of all ages are passing you by, some clicking their tongues at you, others passing comments like ""maal"" and ""totta"" and even others who happen to remember songs like ""tu cheez badi hai mast mast"" just when they are about to cross you. You have to pretend like you didn't hear them, while on the inside you are brimming with anger and disgust.You take the rickshaw and reach the metro station. You are in the queue to get your metro card recharged. Suddenly you feel an unfamiliar brush on your arm. The guy standing behind you has tried to touch you. You give him a sharp look, and he quickly withdraws his hand, but what the heck, he's had his kicks. You rush towards the metro. You climb into the general compartment. You happen to be one of the only two girls in the compartment. You feel all eyes in the compartment scanning you. You feel uncomfortable in the gaze, and try to hide yourself in the remotest corner.A few stations later a guy climbs in. The metro is relatively empty, but he decides to stand uncomfortably close to you. You are firm you will not me made to move from your place because some lecher feels he has that kind of command over you. He keeps getting closer. Too close for comfort maybe. No one else seems to notice. You ultimately decide to wriggle out of that space and go and stand somewhere else. You look back at the guy and find him smirking. You come out of the metro and start walking towards your college gate. You see two guys walking in your direction. You already begin to look down, or start listening to music or pretend to talk to someone on the phone, because have no clue what they might have in store for you. Thankfully they pass you without any comments, just a lecherous look or two. THAT you think is okay, manageable.You reach college, spend a fun day with your friends and head back home, hoping your journey back would be better than the morning's.Your friend calls you up and asks if you are free to hang out. It's already beginning to get dark. You know it takes you 1.5 hours to reach home. You politely refuse. He insists. You agree. You hang out with your friend for about half an hour at some random food joint and then you both head back home. It's 6:30 pm,just beginning to get dark. He says he would drop you to your house as he feels it's unsafe for you to go back on your own. You agree. You are walking back from the bus stop to your house with your friend. Suddenly you feel you are being followed by two sets of bikers, who are riding suspiciously slow and close to you and you can't understand what you should be doing about it. You and your friend just pace up and walk faster to your apartment gate. Then the bikers suddenly speed up and whizz past you laughing. They had their share of entertainment for the day. You are happy to be back in the safety of your housing society. All your friend can manage to say is ""What the bloody hell was that!"".This apart, I have had a wonderful upbringing, with my parents encouraging me and even going out of their ways to help me with all kinds of pursuits and dreams. But it's not the same for more than half the girls here. I am one of the lucky few. We are evolving, and we have a tediously long way to go.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"Greetings from India! All the answers here are beautifully descriptive. I'd like to quip in with a short         list of must-knows about my country, which I hope will put through a clearer           picture of what and what not India is.India is not the land of (just) snake charmers. In fact I've never seen a snake charmer all my life.India, Pakistan and Dubai are not the same country.We do not eat spicy food all the time. But we definitely eat food with spices in it. Also we have a wide variety of vegetarian food which does not involve salads, except as salads! Not all of us know how to do yoga. In fact very few of us know how to do it properly. We are usually too busy eating the above mentioned food :PCamels, horses, elephants and tigers are not as easily available to us as we'd like to believe. In fact, not easily at all.We do not speak English like Apu from The Simpsons. It's far more smooth, but we do like to complete our words before we move on to the next ones.The actors and actresses in our movies sing and dance, and it is not always to take the story forward. We usually enjoy it and don't find it funny unless it is meant to be.Also, Bollywood isn't the only type of Indian dance that exists. There are far too many to mention.Yes the Kama Sutra was written in India, but most Indian people haven't ever read it and mostly never will, and never ever openly. Sex is still taboo.The majority of us have arranged marriages, which usually last us a lifetime. We usually live with our parents and it's a way of life for us. Most of us couldn't think of life any other way, it is mostly out of love and respect and we are certainly not the least bit embarrassed about it.We respect and welcome people of all cultures, religions and nations, and despite being the second most populous nation in the world(with less than half the land area than the most populous one) comparatively very easily grant visas and citizenship .Crime against women and gender discrimination are huge here. A lot more in the villages and remote areas.Despite all our flaws and societal evils, we are time and again quoted to be among the happiest people in the world.We have a rich cultural, geographical, spiritual and intellectual heritage, but I think a lot of the other answers have covered it far more beautifully than I ever could.     Thanks a lot for reading!",high,high,high,low,mid

Medha-Bansal,"I think there's nothing weird to find about students of other engineering colleges. Most of us come from co-educational schools and have good friends across several engineering colleges throughout the country.(It's not like one suddenly forgets how to interact with guys as soon as they leave school.And I say guys because I assume that's what you mean by ""students of other engineering colleges"", as otherwise the question does not even make any sense).Even those who dont,come here with an open perspective. I personlly have many friends who happen to be from all-girls schools and have created great places for themselves as far as any kind of personal or professional interaction with guys is concerned.Personally I think it depends more on the person than the institution.And since the topic has come up, I would really like to bring up something that I have been telling people ever since my First Semester.1.Yes IGDTU is a world in itself. It's an all girls institution ,but it is not a nunnery. Boys are allowed on our campus. In fact, we share our campus with two other co-educational colleges.2. The purpose of setting up IGIT was to promote engineering education for women, and not to keep girls away from boys during the course of their college education.3.IGIT girls are not desperate weirdos, whose only concern in life is to find themselves boyfriends, since now they do not have any guys on their own campus. They are independent, friendly and outgoing girls who also happen to be some of the best brains in the country and are as much focused on  their careers as anything else!Thanks for reading! :)",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"Well, if we strictly consider college and the time spent within it, a lot of big and significant changes took place during my stay at IGIT. I, alongwith my batchmates, basically saw the entire face of the college change over the duration of the four years that we spent here. Here are some notable changes:Beginning of an entire new stream i.e Information Technology started from my batch onwards. We were the first batch of IT here.We were welcomed(read: interacted with ;))on Campus by seniors from both IGIT and the University schools. There were a decent number of guys on campus, so much so that it was hard to believe it was an all girls' college. Within our first two months here, the University schools departed.Consequently, the entire campus came under the control of our college alone. We got a new, enviable library building as opposed to the previous, very small library room near the workshops. It was a pigeonhole, trust me!The new IT Department building came into being, along with a promising new HOD . For a complete year, we were the only class to occupy that building.The said HOD got made the state-of-art Computer Center in record time, god bless him!There were only Xebec and Impulse before we joined. We saw Tremors coming up from scratch and then eventually Espectro. Hence, the four technical fests.Then we started hearing the University rumors, and a certain Madam Dixit paid our college a generous visit.Soon the MCA and M.Tech courses were introduced, right before our eyes.Ambedkar people moved in, and USAP people suddenly got uber creative.Eventually, the East Hostel, where boys from the University schools still lived, even after the schools had moved,  was vacated and came under the control of the West Hostel warden. Pity some of you will never get to experience the jeering and cat-calls that ensued from their windows, once evening approached within campus :PPreviously unheard of events like Spic Macays and Cutual evenings started taking place. A nice and much needed change.Many fun FB pages came us, which became quite a rage, Like Aap IGITian Hain and IGDTUW Confessions and Compliments.We saw many generations of canteens, from the old Handa Canteen(now inactive), to the momos and aloo chaat wale bhaiyya within campus( his stall was blown in a gas cylinder tragedy), to the new Maggi and Pasta offering kiosks and eventually Ambedkar's Stri Shakti.We saw the Ritz as ruins and shambles and then after months of repairs and speculations, it reopened, giving us all hope for boring lectures and longer than 2 hour breaks. The newest of movies at stone's throw,it really was a dream come true. Comapnies like Cisco, Qualcomm and Microsoft visited for intern selection for the first time. It was unprecedented at the time it happened.Someone had the good sense of opening the indispensable Photocopy Shop, finally. Going all the way to KG market, or the metro station, I cant even begin to recall what a pain in the  rear it was to get a document xeroxed.Finally our own Cult Fest did take place. It was hard to believe we were in our own college, even when we were actually there and the events were happening before our eyes. Taarangana '14 FTW!And last, but certainly in no way the least, IGIT became Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. A GIANT LEAP for the college as well as for all of us us. Only hoping it keeps getting bigger and better.Funny how the oncoming junior batches will have these things as they are, unlike us who witnessed the transitions actually happening, but I am sure they'll have stories to tell of their own.This is all I can remember for now. Eventful college life no? :P",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"Without a doubt, 'The Power of Love'Snape's love for Lily, that made him a dedicated ally of Dumbledore. God knows what would have happened if he has remained truly affiliated to Voldemort while still working at Hogwarts.Dumbledore's love for his family, that made him give up the dark arts and practices, and eventually defeat Grindelwald. Voldemort would else have been a mere Death Eater in the order set by Grindelwald and Dumbledore.Obviously, Lily's love for Harry, which left him with a protection that even the most powerful dark wizard of all time could not fathom.Neville's love for his parents and their honor, that made him come out of his shell and become a rebel. Trust him for killing Nagini, the final horcrux, that made Voldemort truly mortal.Mr. and Mrs. Weasley's love for everyone, which made them such kind and gracious hosts, at all times and under the direst of situations, even when they and their family had to suffer.Narcissa's love for Draco, which didn't let her reveal that Harry was indeed alive when all the Death Eaters were revelling in his death.Dobby's love for his freedom, and Harry, that made him save their lives while giving up his own. Similarly Kreacher's love for his master, Regulus.Harry's love for all wizarding folk, that made him give up his life in a wink's time, leaving behind the same protection for them that his mother had left for him.And finally, Voldemort's inability to understand it all, that led to his ultimate downfall.The entire series, I think sends out a strong message that we human beings are nothing without love and he who does not love, does not live.  It's importance has been so beatifully veiled in the gripping narrative by JKR, and that's what I find the most inspiring.",high,high,high,low,mid

Medha-Bansal,"To all the people answering here, and let me be very clear that I do not wish to demean you or your experience in any way,the women in question most definitely must have left you feeling extremely hurt or harassed.But I can't help myself from observing that these are very particular incidents(And I in no way mean that the women in question were right in what they did).Get a girl to answer the same question, and she'll open up(if she actually gathers the courage to) about the long list of experiences she has had to, and still continues to  face at the hands of men- friends,relatives,known, unknown, unwanted-all kinds- since early childhood. So please look at this forum as a way of sharing a really bad experience you had with a woman , and not try to justify what the person who has asked the question means to imply or as a reply to the questions whose links he has shared.I can go on record saying that I personally know a lot of people, who never were and will never be- rapists/stalkers/molesters...etc. But the fact remains that there are a lot of men, WHO ARE. And they are in far greater numbers than any such women.To the person who asked this question: I wish you were a woman for one day, just one day, and tried to walk the city streets laughing about with your friends, or maybe just simply tried to walk, or were some little girl in a village carrying pails and pails of water while your little brothers went to school, expected to give birth to no less than 3 children before you turn 15, or worse, some newly married girl, who instead of weaving dreams of peaceful matrimony with your husband, are thinking of ways to die, as your parents cant afford to spend a single more penny on you and you cant think of anything else to protect their honor and your own.Take your pick.

They capture Old Delhi (Chandni Chowk) through the eyes of a hungry 19 year old college student, who went there in search of the famous Paraanthe Wali Gali, and came back completely mesmerized by the old world charm. Dusty, quaint and always ready to take one by surprise, the by lanes of this locality have truly so much more to offer than what first meets the eye. Kindly bear with the picture quality, these were taken 3 years ago, by a low resolution cellphone camera! Welcome to Chandni Chowk, where dwells the quaint charm of a very very old Delhi.The very famous Ballimaran. Dingy, crowded and full of hanging overhead electric wires, but also the wholesale hub for shoes, spectacle frames and glass bangles.And that, in the distance, seen through the hanging wires is a mosque.Bangles and shoes. Bling and comfort. All at once.Main roads like that, seldom seen anywhere else in Delhi.Pointing to the various kuchas, katras and kalans.A monstrous haveli makes way for numerous stalls and shops.The old delhi  jaalidaar architecture( or whatever's left of it).Another one of those beautiful havelis giving in to more modern quarters.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"There is no problem I guess, but we are all (both Indian guys and girls) a generation behind, or maybe we have our own distorted idea, as far as the concept of dating is concerned.We first need to be comfortable with the idea of what dating actually means.Lets start with what it does not mean:Girls: It does not mean texting each other about every small detail of what's happening in your respective lives, calling each other for the rest of the time and chatting your ways through whatever little is left.  It does not mean the guy who's asking you out is trying to get physical with you, or wants you to be his girlfriend. It does not mean you have control over what he should and shouldn't be doing(it applies to the guys as well). It does not mean fancy proposals followed by innumerable fancy ""dates"". It does not mean the guy always paying the bills. It definitely does not mean being in a relationship.Guys: It does not mean the girl is your girlfriend. It does not mean she's ready to get physical with you at the drop of a hat. It is not a free pass for sneaking out a girl's number from somewhere, sending her messages showing intent of getting to know her or be friends with her and then on being rejected by her for being a complete stranger, complaining that Indian girls are not easy to date.(Try to get to personally know the girl, even if the slightest bit, or even if you are asking her out on a complete hunch, at least be upfront about it.Please, not through messages or emails. It is in a girl's nature to not trust anyone whom she doesn't know, and she can't be blamed for it. It's what she has been taught since early childhood, ""for her own safety"").Lastly, it does not mean you are now expected to do everything she wants you to, and that you have lost your freedom or space.What it means:Girls: For me, it means someone wanting to get to know you. Just that. And you reciprocating with the same gesture if you happen to like the person in some way. Or saying a simple no if you dont, without feeling the need to call the cops or security or thinking that the person is a freak/molester/rapist(You could wait to find that out if the person continues to persist once you've said you're not interested ). It may be that he approached you because he liked the way you looked or talked, but that may not be the only reason why he did so.You can find out, by actually going out with him. Give him a chance.Guys: It means wanting to get to know a person you liked, for something that might have struck a chord with you. It also means taking rejection in your stride(and I say this for guys  because it is kind of an unsaid norm that the guy asks the girl out. I am not in complete agreement with this , but that's another story altogether). Not every girl you ask out will want to go out with you, and that is not always because you are not extremely rich, powerful or good looking. She may just not be in the space where she wants to date anybody, or might already have someone in her life. So it means not directly associating it with your self esteem. You took a chance, it didn't work...leave it at that. And yeah, it means finding out if the girl is more than just a pretty face or intelligent talk...or whatever it was you initially liked about her.Basically it means spending meaningful time with another person, trying to decipher them and finding out if what you find works for you. It has its root in something different than friendship,some kind of attraction maybe, but it does not necessarily have to develop into a relationship unless both the people mutually feel so. And currently, I believe we, as Indian youth, are still not totally comfortable with the idea. So I think we need to work on it a little more before dating comes to be accpeted for what it actually is.Signing off with hopes of finding more people take this concept forward with an open mind, trying to have fun, with much less hangups and even lesser hangovers. Adios!Disclaimer: I am not making any generalizations and not trying to typecast anybody. People who are dating may chose to do or not do any of the above mentioned things and I accept there will always be people who believe otherwise than what I have written. The answer above just expresses my personal views on what I have found out, based on a general observation of the people around me, and even me myself.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"It may not probably be the nicest thing that anyone has ""ever"" done for me, but it's the one thing that came to my mind when I read this question.It might be a little long, but I think the details are important, so here I share: I was once travelling by the Delhi Metro, during peak office hours. I had an exam and I was VERY late. I jumped off into the general coach( and not the women's coach,I had forgotten how crowded it gets in my hurry to board). But I thought I would simply stand against the door on the other side, like I usually do when I travel in the general coach and somehow manage to alight one piece at Rajiv Chowk. This day however wasn't the usual Delhi Metro day, as I soon learned. I noticed that the train was running slower than usual and more people than usual were boarding at every station. Obviously there was some technical fault and the metro was behind schedule. I kept to the door as I saw the compartment get more crowded with each passing station. Okay, here I have to mention that somehow, I was the only girl in the compartment at that time. And being my tiny self, I was finding it harder to sustain myself as the compartment filled up. Barely 5 stations down, I was gasping for breath and no one noticed. People pushed against me( and not in an intended-to-molest way but in the general making-space-for-themselves way).I couldn't push anyone back, however hard I tried. I couldn't get down as for that I would have had to cruise  through the entire crowd between me and the door, which was next to impossible at that point of time.People were falling on me, I was totally crushed against the door, I was helpless and I had tears in my eyes. I thought my spine would break anytime. Just about that time, I felt some space making up in front of me. I could finally breathe a little.Then suddenly a guy appeared, facing me, between me and the rest of the crowd. He spread his arms and put them on the train doors, on either side of me.Our bodies touched a little, but there was no sign of any kind of physical advances from him. I was so relieved to have finally gotten a tiny bit of space.Saving myself from being crushed was so important to me at that time, that I hardly noticed anything else.I was still terrified.I stood there, exactly in the same position, for over half an hour. So did he. He never moved.Almost as soon as the train stopped at Rajiv Chowk, he moved away and everybody was so busy trying to get off the train that I never noticed where he went. Walking away from the train, I suddenly realised that he had taken the entire weight of the stumbling and falling crowd upon his back to protect me. And had stood there, without a cry of pain or distress, for over half an hour! I never saw his face, as I had not looked up while he stood there, and I never got to thank him. But he definitely saved me from getting brutally injured.And that's how I will always remember him. For being the nicest and the most thoughtful person I had met.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"No thanks for the A2A Devbrat Rathore, because I very clearly understand the undertone :P , but I'll answer anyway!Bits of this are from another  answer that I have written ( Medha Bansal's answer to Dating and Relationships in India: Why is it difficult to date an Indian woman in general? )No, it's not okay to suddenly approach a girl and ask her out. Not in this country, nor in many others. Her worst intuition will suddenly rise to her defense and you shall mostly find yourself in highly uncomfortable situations that might involve a lot of ""how dare you""s and ""what nonsense""s in high pitched voices, angry parents/boyfriends/brothers/friends, security guards and if you are really lucky, even some cops.This is how girls in India have been taught to react to over friendly advances from random strangers since early childhood, ""for their own safety"". And even if we keep societal diktats apart, does this even make sense?Would you go out with some random girl, who saw you at a park or a mall, and asked you out just because you look ""beautiful""?The girl has no reason to trust you or believe you, unless of course you are equally ""beautiful"". You must try to get to know her, even if a little, and certainly not in a creepy way, before you ask her out.As far as your issues are concerned, I'm a little confused. If you are actually socially awkward, specifically around girls, then this is the most anti-phobic thing you could do. And why would you want to do that, specially in a country like ours, where the consequences might be life threatening to say the least.Then you say you are taking it subtle, where you are trying to meet and talk to as many people as you can in order to open up. You had me lost there.That should have helped. It was exactly what I was going to suggest you do.And if the most logical approach isn't helping, the stunts you plan on performing definitely won't.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"Okay, we all know the story of two teachers from a famous department getting married. So I'll not go into that :PHere I'll talk about the other love story, which almost all of us go through. The story of hate and disappointment turning into love and affection. Our hate for the college and the disappointment of not getting into a tier-I institution. Also that it's all girls' for a lot of people.To be honest,the first 4-6 months suck, to different extents for everyone, but they do.You are hopeless and sarcastic of everything that surrounds you.And then, you talk to seniors. And find friendships. And soak in the freedom that comes from being in an all girls' institution. And start hanging out and going places and looking for ways to still be successful. You start realizing it's ""not that bad"". You begin working for your grades(or decide not to). There are moments that take your breath away,make you wish time just stopped, turning into beautiful memories for a lifetime.You realize how indispensable all your gal pals have become, the center of your small world.You smile to yourself often thinking about the crazy things you guys do and all the girl love of course. There are the highs and the lows.You go through good, bad and extremely tense times together. And just when you are about to leave, that's when it strikes you, you are a woman, an engineer and an  IGITian for Life.Someone very wise once said to me, ""The best love stories are your own"".

Medha-Bansal,"This experience is memorable both personally and for my entire team.There was this big annual quiz competiton which used to have a theme every year and the theme for that year's competition was ""Science As We Know It"".I was in 10th standard at that time.I wasn't a member of the initial 4 member squad from our school which had qualified through the initial rounds(It comprised of two seniors from 12th, and two others from 11th...all of them from the science stream). I was chosen as the last minute replacement for a senior, who had fallen sick with Jaundice. I was informed by my teacher through a phone call on the eve of the competition. I went into a tizzy. I wasn't the least prepared and moreover I was going to be on the same team as my quizzing idols, my favorite seniors. These were people I looked up to and didn't want to let down. So obviously I tried to read up on everything I could through the night. The next morning too, as the other three chilled,I couldn't help but go through my quiz diary. Having had enough, they snatched my diary from me and asked me to relax. I was a kid, I had to obey.But I couldn't help feeling restless,most people were much older, and hence much more knowledgeable,I assumed.Then we sat at our respective positions. A guy on the team seated next said: ""Good luck, little girl!"" with strong emphasis on 'little', and even stronger on ""girl"".The quiz went on for a good time, I couldn't answer much questions as they were mainly from higher Physics and Biology.I mostly just sat along and my team-mates were extremely supportive. Then a question rolled over to us from our neighbours."" Who discovered the chromosome?"". It was the win-lose question for us. Funny that I didn't think I knew the answer when the other team was asked this question, but as soon as our turn came, I blurted out mechanically:"" Morgan, in 1901"". I spoke out without consulting my team, and they all looked rather disappointed. After speaking out everyone's scores..and creating the obligatory suspense..the Quiz Master declared our answer correct. We totally lost our minds on this one and went crazy celebrating.WE HAD WON!My team member then asked me on our way back how I knew the answer.

Medha-Bansal,"This is from a star watching trip in college. I don't think it's much, but it's my spookiest ever.It was an overnight trip to a place some 2.5 hours away from Delhi. It was a sparsely populated village in the middle of nowhere where we were told there would no electricity after 9 pm. Complete darkness. Perfect setting.We were to observe from the middle of a vast field and were camping in an under construction school building at the edge of the field. Since there was nothing much to look forward to in the school building or village, we decided to camp outside in the open field all night long and dumped our backpacks in the building, carrying along just our torches.We were a little unlucky that night, as it turned out to be extremely cloudy. It was 1 am already and we hadn't had much luck with the phenomenon we were trying to observe. I was suddenly bored and sleepy and decided to go back to the school building(some 300-400 meters away)to sleep.I had already dragged my friends there twice and since everybody else wanted to be in the middle of the field, I decided to go back all alone this time.Mind you, there was not a single person in the building at that time.This is where the spook begins. I reached the dormitory alright. Laid down my backpack and just when I had rested my head I started hearing low moans. Then heavy breathing, as if someone was in the room with me. I tried to waive it off for some insect, but it kept growing stronger, like the person was coming closer to me. I was already a little creeped for having come out on my own, and this was a too much to take. I immediately got up and decided to rush back.Though it could have been a pure coincidence, but my torch (which I had put new batteries in, just for the trip) stopped working!! I was scared as hell. I shakily walked back to the middle of the field, and all this while I had the strongest sensation that somebody was walking beside me, even brushing by me now and then. I obviously couldn't do anything but keep walking, my heart thumping. It was about 3 minutes of pure creeps!Ironically, when I reached back, there was a lot of shrieking going on. I learnt people were discussing ghost stories and trying to scare each other off. I just sat there dumbfounded, not speaking much and never mentioned the incidence to anyone, until now.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"Well, I am not the ass-kissing type and have always let my work talk for me. As far as my college teachers are concerned,I have been completely rebellious. I have never engaged in chit-chats or over friendly gestures with any of my teachers to get those two extra marks or whatever else people do it for. Don't take me wrong, I have always held my teachers in the highest regard, but I just don't see the point of engaging in casual gossip with them and honestly can't even come up with any, even if I try.So the only experience I have of a real boss hitherto is that of my Manager during a summer internship program.He was a good man, and did not bother anyone much in general, but he was a taskmaster and wanted his deliverables in time(or even well before). I wouldn't exactly call this epic, but yeah I did let go off a much awaited team outing to this amazing locale(and I regret it to date) to get in his good books and establish myself as a sincere worker.

Medha-Bansal,"Okay, this is my thing. Smiling.To answer your question, yes I smile. At friends, at kids, at random strangers. I feel it can make a difference to a lot of people's day, and even my own. In times of stress or difficulty, I tend to smile even more. It can be annoying as hell sometimes and often I am myself left to wonder. But still I smile. It's my secret weapon. It helps me to not give away my anxiety or fears .It helps me not be weak.It gives me a reason to believe that all will be okay, as it usually turns out to be.I smile so much that  People usually tend to remember me as ""that girl who smiles a lot"" and they often find this endearing. Narcissism alert ; And I have been told by a lot of people that I have a beautiful smile, that it reaches my eyes, and honestly I love it. I love being complimented for my smile because I know there isn't an ounce of fakeness in it.Whenever I smile, it truly comes from the bottom of my heart or never at all. And that's about it.Well also I personally believe I have a hideous smile, because of my very large front teeth( the reason for one of my very famous bunny-smiles, but that is another story) and can't smile with my mouth closed, however hard I try.

Medha-Bansal,"Honestly, everything that I know of or have become or hope to be is because of my mother. I have no clue where I would be standing,if at all,if it were not for her. I have learnt so many things from her, both through her telling me and through observation that it is difficult to contain them in a single answer, but  If it were to be brought down to just 10, then I would choose the following:1. Strength of character: My mother has an extremely strong personality, with very strong beliefs and principles She has always encouraged me to hold my own in any kind of situation and not be intimidated by it. All the strength I have, I draw from my mother, and it has helped me sail through the toughest of times.2. Not attach my self esteem and happiness to any particular person or situation:She basically wanted me to be independent and happy being just myself. She always says that that he who is completely comfortable in their solitude will never have a dearth of good company. 3. Importance of reading good literature and having productive hobbies: She had me reading since a very early age and I took to it like a fish to water. I basically used to watch her read everyday before she went to sleep, and soon took up the habit myself. It has so majorly affected the person that I am today, and I can never thank her enough for it. She encouraged me to take up several other hobbies, as she believed  they play a major role in shaping our characters, and I find they really do.4. Difference between success and failure: Here I'll quote her directly, ""Sapne dekhne aur sapne sach hone mein bas ek chhote se shabd ki doori hai-Hausla"", which translates to that between watching dreams and making them come true, there lies only the small difference of courage.  She has always told me that talent will only take you as far as the threshold. It is your hard work that will take you through.5. Have four good friends, but have them for life: She always told me that even if I have one friend, it should be one true friend, who I can always rely on. I was always so busy trying to surround myself with people that I never understood what she meant. NOW I do.6. Not live in the past, carry on: This I learnt with great difficulty, but nevertheless I did. Shrug the past, pull yourself together and move ahead with all the courage you can muster. Everything can be overcome, or at least you'll die trying :)7. Humility and compassion: She says that how we behave towards the less privileged really shows the kind of person we are. I have always seen her treat those lesser than her in any form with even more compassion and respect than she would have for her peers. Love everyone equally and make no one feel small. And this is a trait I am proud to inherit.8. The importance of dreams: She has encouraged me to dream, to fly and to be anything I want to be. 9. The importance of trust: She has always laid such good faith in me that it has forced me into never being able to lie to her, or never even feeling the need to.Also I know that I can tell her anything, and it will be safe with her.I have thus learnt how battles can be won without ever picking up the arms.10.No job is too small, no pay is too less:Self explanatory. An extended lesson in humility I think, not just towards others, but also ourselves.and finally, the more general one,which keeps coming up every now and then. Never take BS from anyone. Protect your family and always try and have a job. Be good to everyone around you, but if someone smacks you once, you smack them twice,AND HARD!I know it's a little long, but like I said, it's hard to contain. Thanks for keeping up until this.

Medha-Bansal,"I am sharing three. 4 years of college and countless pictures clicked with countless number of people, but these three particularly stand out for me, and always will.This first one was taken on a day during a phase when I was very upset. I wanted to be free of something that had been bothering me for quite some time. This was on a usual day in college, when I was mulling over yet another non-issue. Then this SLR owning friend suddenly turns up and asks me to give her my best shot. All I could think was that I wanted to fly. Out and away, from everything. And be happy like I used to be. This picture is everything I am, or have ever hoped to be: happy, perky, zesty and yes,free and it always reminds me of how things changed as soon as I realized the mess was created by no one but me, and hence was my own to clear.The next two are from my final day at a pretty unforgettable summer internship. I was heading back from two months of plain awesomeness to a much dreaded placement season and an entire year of maddening anxiety in general, and there were a zillion thoughts running in my mind all at once.

Medha-Bansal,"Oh, this should be fun, I remember a few of these things from my childhood.I'm not sure if they count for much.When I was very young, probably 7 or 8, I had a habit of collecting stones. I used to collect stones which I found distinctive and used to give them points and store them in a box. I remember I used to mark them on physical appearance and weight. Since I had no way to weigh them,and I don't remember how I devised this method, I used to put them in a glass and see how much water had risen, mark starting and ending points with a pencil and measuring the difference with a ruler. This was way before I knew it was based on the Archimedes' Principle and I was honestly surprised when I learnt it was something that needed to be studied.Also my parents taught me the mathematical tables quite early on.According to them, I had started doing mental math way before I learnt to read and write. I don't remember that part but what I remember is that I have been using the cyclic properties of numbers for as far back as I can remember. The table of 9 has been my absolute favorite and I remember discovering the digit reversal property as well as the cyclicity of the digits, and using it in my everyday calculations since a very early age. Even today, I break the calculations in my head into parts of 9 rather than 10, as I find it easier to deal with.As a 5th grader, I remember watching some show on Discovery channel, and sitting on my building rooftop for one entire day, making weird markings around a stick stuck in a ball of dough, and measuring shadow lengths and angles with my geometry set. I had made a lot of calculations based on what I had seen in the show in a notebook and then forgotten about it. A few years back, I found that notebook on an old shelf and opened it to see that it had results for the Earth's radius. When I searched on the internet, I found my results were in very close approximation to the actual radius. Boy, was I elated! I further found the proper technique, a reference here: Measure Your World - Calculate .I plan to do it again one of these days, and see if my calculations and patience are any match to those of the 10 year old me.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"What is unique about Claire Underwood is she is as much a part of the relationship arrangement as Frank . It is mutual in the true sense of the word. She let go off Adam Galloway, her carefree lifestyle and even her ambitions of ever becoming a mother, all by choice.She's shown to be completely ruthless and pragmatic. What I am saying, and I may be wrong, is that such a relationship takes a lot more effort from the woman in the relationship than the man. All girls, even career focused ones, are not always like that. Every person is different and they can easily tend to play down their emotions and prioritize life goals to appear to be strong and succeed, while still harboring desires of love, friendship,companionship and romance at some point of their lives. Such people will find it difficult to alienate themselves, while still be attached, like Claire does. It will either come naturally to them, or it will never.Discussing this openly with the person is the best bet you have, but they need to have a clear understanding of what you want, and it is important for you too to understand if they really can be the person you are asking them to be. Else, it will only make the situation messier.",high,high,high,low,mid
Medha-Bansal,"Thanks for the A2A Manasvi :)I used to read a lot of blogs some time back, but time spent on blogs has dropped significantly ever since I became active on Quora. They were usually too varied to categorize, but I'll still list out the ones I particularly loved:1. The now famous, Hyperbole and a Half by Allie Brosh. I began reading it in first year of college. it's a little crude, but cool too.2. Then there's ZEN PENCILS which isn't precisely a blog, but it is kind of too. The comics are wonderful and offer great perspective in a way that stays with you without being too preachy.3. My ever favourite The Delhi Walla by journalist Mayank Austen Soofi. It started off with his weekly columns in the Hinustan Times and metamorphed into a blog and then a complete website. There's no one who can give you a better insight to everything Delhi, whether you are a Delhiite or not.4. Then I quite regularly visit Aayi's Recipes and RAK'S KITCHEN because I love to cook and these websites offer great ideas.5. I ABSOLUTELY (x2) love the following blog My Life is a Jalebi by a guy called Sarthak Ahuja. He is ridiculously funny and you've got to read it yourself to know what I'm talking about.6. If video blogs are to be considered as well, I follow IISuperwomanII on YouTube. Trust me, she's awesome.7. Then I keep an eye out for the newest posts on Terribly Tiny Tales on Facebook, they kind of make my day.8. I am on and off on almost all National Geographic blogs, Intelligent Travel - Cultural, Authentic, Sustainable in particular.

Medha-Bansal,"Not very bad features, but these are a few things that I found make Quora a little less comfortable to use for me. 1. The entire comments chain on an answer opens up when we click on the Comments tab and we cant move on to the next answer until we either scroll down through all the comments, or scroll back all the way up to close the comments tab.2. We cannot make edits on our answers from our own Answers archive, while we can still comment on them and share them from there. Also, if we click on our answers, it takes us to the question page, where we have to search for our answer and then make edits. It sometimes gets a little tedious if it is a question that has evoked a large number of answers.3. Also the answers with maximum upvotes are usually found at the top while I've seen some really great answers lurking somewhere down below. I think it is a little unfair to writers who may have answered the question late. They should probably appear in random order and tabs like 'most upvoted', 'most popular'(based on the discussion and comments that follow), 'maximum content', etc. should be there for readers' convenience. Just saying :PPlease do tell if there's a way around these, that I have been missing, since I'm comparatively new here. Thanks!",high,high,high,low,mid
Mehek-Bassi,"Girls make 'those' men their 'brothers' who 'they' think will cause a trouble later on!Let me tell you the story of my inbox -On Quora, I receive mostly questions from readers who want me to help, and I'm always glad to see them. I help them too! But sometimes, this is what I GET:And just when I thought I was getting to rude with this man who was just giving me his whatsapp number and wanted to ask a 'personal' question, I thought I might give him another chance to speak for himself, and then - THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS:He ended up asking me 'what is the right age to have sex for boy and girl'. Either this man is born yesterday or he is simply 'not' a human being to realize the answer to this question based upon his own 'instincts'. And even if I think that it was an innocent question, the FACT that he ASKED Me for my number (without knowing me at all) CREEPS ME OUT EVEN MORE!So, my point is - every girl has experienced some creepiness in her life. And her past experiences make her adopt 'PREVENTION is better than CURE' and so, the guys she thinks might turn out to be creeps, she makes them her 'brothers'. And that is ONE CASE.The other case is - she is already interested in someone else, and doesn't want any other guy in her life, not even as a friend so that her boyfriend has no problem. That's why she makes all guy-friends her brothers so that they pose no problem in her relationship in future, and even if someone ends up liking her, they can't do anything about it because the girl already made them 'her' brothers!EDIT: Some highly intellectual people have reported my answer for being 'irrelevant' to the question. To them, I would like to make a request that please 'read' the question once again - It's ""WHY"" do Indian girls make their male friends their brothers, the question is ""WHY"" and not ""WHAT KIND OF INDIAN GUYS"" do girls make their brothers! My answer is relevant because of the above mentioned points. I'm not saying that Indian girls make 'perverts' their brothers, but their 'past-experiences' with men, force them to keep them in 'brother-zone' to AVOID any kind of 'situation' in future.",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"There are many awesome reasons to date a Punjabi guy, but here I would mention the top 10 benefits of having a Punjabi boyfriend:1. FOOD!You can never worry about dates, or food because Punjabis are BIG foodies, and there is a very negligible chance that your boyfriend will take you to the same place 'twice' unless it has an amazing variety or delicious platter!2. MONEY!All Punjabis may or may not be rich, but they are all highly generous people! So, you don't need to worry about money-issues cropping up between the both of you. Chances are, he will pay for almost all of your dates (being a gentleman) and he will rather 'enjoy' spending on you if he loves you. Don't be freaked out if he FORCES you to SHOP!EDIT: This is the case of my guy. And no, I don't FORCE him to pay but it's his choice, he never lets me pay because paying for the dates makes ""him"" happy. And what is a relationship? Caring about each other's happiness! Some people said it is hypocrite that I call my guy a gentleman just because he pays - my answer to them is - NO! It's not that I never offer to pay or always ask him to pay. Since the day he proposed to me, the first thing he said was - money should never come between us. We are 2 people in this relationship, Mehek - don't make it 3! On one date, I tried to pay, but he threw my purse away saying that I was trying to create a drift. After that I never tried to pay! For those who say I don't have any self-respect - well, my guy and I meet for only 3 times in one year as we are in a long-distance relationship, and after so much time and distance, when we meet for a few hours for a movie or lunch, I let him do what makes HIM happy! I don't want to fight or argue on those little dates and make them worse. And it's not that I am just letting him spend money on me, and doing nothing - NO! I make sure that on every date, while he chooses to pay the bill, I gift him something for his efforts, for coming to meet me, for taking out time, and spending a day with me. And that gift can be anything - it has been a Guess Watch worth 'Rs 15K', it has been a cardboard box with paper hearts inside worth - 'Rs 0' as I made it myself. The point is - we don't DISCUSS money. We don't let it come between us. The people calling me hypocrite and having no self-respect are someone who can do nothing, but JUST CALCULATE the money spent in their own relationships. BUT we don't do THAT! We are 2 people in this relationship at the end, and NOT THREE!3. FUN!Punjabis are super-fun to hang out with. There is no chance that you can ever get bored with him. He will keep entertaining you no matter what! Punjabis are born 'pranksters'. Chances are - you might see yourself pulling pranks on your dates, rather than sitting like a usual couple, fighting over which soup to order!4. TRIPS & TRAVEL!Punjabis are very fond of vacations. If you end up marrying a Punjabi guy, he might make you travel the whole world with him! Almost every second couple in Punjab these days, is exploring Europe, Australia and New Zealand on their honeymoons (even the people who are middle-class, they somehow save and pack their bags and get going! I've seen it myself!).5. RESPECT!Punjabi kids are taught to respect their elders since the day we are born. A Punjabi guy will always treat your parents very respectfully, 'uncle-jee', 'aunty-jee', 'namaste-jee', 'pairee-pauna' etc! Punjabis always respect elders, unlike some other cultures in India where kids are calling their parents as 'tu'!6. LOVE & PROMISES!Punjabis are die-hard lovers! All the tragic yet, historical love stories - ranging from Heer-Ranjha to Sohni-Mahiwal are Punjabi! Punjabis are known to make sacrifices for their love. If you are dating a Punjabi guy, and he is serious for you - he will marry you. No other option! They don't care about society or people once they commit. That's how they KEEP their promises!7. POSSESSIVENESS & EMOTIONS!No idea about other culture-guys, but a Punjabi guy is usually really possessive for his girlfriend. I'm not talking about it in a negative manner, but they look really cute when they are jealous! Above all, a Punjabi guy is a really emotional one. If he loves you - he will do anything for you - ANYTHING!8. EGO!The thing I love about Punjabi guys is their male-ego. NO - again NOT NEGATIVE! I am referring to the male-ego in a sense where if some guy has passed a comment on you, or touched you inappropriately or done anything to annoy you - God save him from the wrath of your boyfriend! A Punjabi guy will give his life before someone touches his woman and he can even take another man's life for touching his woman! Yes, they are so egoistic about it.9. FRIENDSHIP!More than a boyfriend in a relationship, a Punjabi guy will be your best-friend! You can share anything with him, any time you want and he will always welcome it! There are chances that he might love to get your bizarre wishes fulfilled like - having a tattoo, sky diving, under-water diving, parasailing, anything that you want to do, and if it involves pain or danger - don't worry if you are dating a Punjabi guy! He will make you jump into the water, and push you down the cliff to enhance the fun-factor - yes, they are so AMAZING!10. The Ultimate Punjabi VYAAH!Punjabi weddings are NEVER boring. If you date a Punjabi guy, and you end up marrying him - chances are that you are going to have the most amazing wedding out of all your friends! The weddings functions last for like a month - with all kinds of ceremonies you have never heard of before, and with all kinds of rituals you've never seen before. There are always new things in Punjabi weddings, things that other cultures can't even expect to have. You can expect unlimited booze and drinks, you can dance like no-one's watching and you can have fun all you want! The cocktail, bachelor-party, sangeet, mehendi, wedding, reception - all in all a month full of fun and frolic. It's not a wedding-day for Punjabis, but a wedding-month! Relatives from all across the globe (especially Canada and UK) visit Punjab to attend the wedding of their beloved, and you can expect really awesome gifts as a new bride! Plus the love you are going to get in the family!SOURCE: Myself. Dating a Punjabi guy since 5 years, and not even a single minute of boredom!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"In Arranged alliances, the tension is too much! It's not a regular date where a girl and guy are meeting because of their will, but they are meeting because their parents want them to meet, so you have to be a gentleman in asking questions.First make sure that the girl is comfortable, and not nervous or shivering or crying! Make sure she is okay and she wants to talk, only then proceed.Your first question should always be 'How are you?' For courtesy sake! She will appreciate the fact that you cared about her before you bombarded her with your questions!You can ask her about her qualification, her education, her college, her interests, her hobbies, what she likes to do in her spare time. But don't be BORING!And DON'T behave like host of a quiz-show! Don't just keep on asking questions! Also tell her something about yourself 'along' with her answers. LIKE - You ask her 'what are your interests?' She says ""I like cooking and baking in my free time. I really like baking muffins!"" You can say: ""Oh, I like eating muffins! I would love to taste some of your delicacies..."" See? You not only told her about your love for food, but also added some humor into the conversation! You need to be interesting and funny, try to make her laugh, so that it's not only you who is asking back to back questions, but even she should ask some!Keep these things in mind for the first meeting, rest everything will go fine :) Good Luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Well, if your parents are not ready to listen to you, or let you marry someone you love - there is only one solution that is left!Marry the girl of their choice. That's what you can do, because neither your parents want you to marry someone else, and nor you can marry your girlfriend after going against your parents. If you can't do any of these, you are in a deadlock situation, and the way out of such a situation is just marrying someone of your parents' choice. That's the only way, you can keep your parents happy, and you won't have to go against them!However, in all this, your girlfriend is someone who will have to suffer the most, and God forbid, if you get a girl in this arranged-marriage who is completely opposite to you, or you both have no bonding at all even after years, and she is unwilling to adjust or you both are simply incompatible, or anything like that - you will have to live a life full of compromise. Good luck for that!Talking to your parents is the only thing that is sensible and EVERYONE will suggest you this! There's no magic want on Quora that people will give it to you and your situation will be alright overnight. We all can just give you suggestions and advises, what has to be done, it has to be done by YOU only. So, wait for a few months, show denial. If they ask you to marry some other girl - say you don't want to get married EVER in life. What will they do? They won't force you, tie you up in ropes and chains, and get you married, will they? Simply show a denial towards marriage and the entire concept of marriage. After a few months or years, when they will be tired of you and everything, they will simply be pissed off enough to let you marry anyone, but just get married! Then you can marry your girlfriend.It's a difficult and risky thing, but this thing was done by one of my distant-relatives. Here is his long story short -So, my distant-cousin was in love with this girl since 10th standard (both were 16-17 years old), who was the only daughter of her father. Her father was a multi-millionaire, and owner of a hotel-chain throughout India (won't reveal the name here) and wanted to marry off his daughter to someone who was a millionaire as well, and then hand over his entire business empire, and hotel chain to his son-in-law. When daughter confessed her love to my cousin, her father repelled, and shouted, and attempted suicide as well, but the girl wasn't ready to subside. She said she would either marry him, or stay a spinster for her entire life. Her father was fine with the latter. He didn't pressure or ask her for marriage till she was 28. One day, when he asked, she again took his name saying that she will marry either him, or nobody! And then her father called my cousin (who was doing a nominal engineering job at that time), at his home for marriage-proposal. Her father asked him to leave his job, his family, and everyone, and stay at their home with him! My cousin revolted. He wasn't ready for this at all! He said, 'Sir, if you want to marry your daughter to me, marry her to the person she fell in love with, marry her to what I am, and what I have been. Don't marry her to someone, who had to change just to marry her. I can't take your business because it's YOURS. You have made it, and you have nurtured it so far. I cannot take even a penny from your side. I will keep your daughter happy, I promise, but she has to stay with me after marriage, like all girls do. I cannot leave my parents and my home, and stay with you!'With that said, her father called the marriage off. It would be a big insult in front of his friends, and social-circle, that he was marrying his daughter to a middle-class man. Again they had to part their ways. His father brought in alliances of rich boys for his daughter, but the girl was adamant. She would either marry her love, or marry no-one at all. 3 years passed by and she turned 31. Her father, sick and tired of her, and worried more about her age, finally called my cousin again, and married them off in a simple ceremony last year. My cousin took a one rupee coin from her father on his wedding day! And that is how he got married to the love of his life, after 14 years of relationship, in 2014. They have a gorgeous baby-boy now, and her father is too happy because the girl is very happy!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Ever wondered why most (99%) conversations just ""DIE"" after a ""HI""? You need a STRONG reason to start a conversation, and that reason should be ultimately responsible to keep the conversation going!That reason can be any, but there has to be one, so that you don't come out as a creep to the girl! You can initiate conversation any way you like, just DON'T say the following things -You are the most pretty/beautiful/cute/smart/intelligent/charming girl I have ever seen. Girls HATE it in FIRST conversation, especially when you barely know her. It's nothing but a ""creep"" alert!NEVER ask her if she has 'whatsapp'. I mean - come-on! She has whatsapp, everyone has, but that's another cheap trick to get her number and all girls know that already!NEVER ask her to add you on Facebook, when she barely knows you! Chances are, it will be the 'last' conversation of you with her.NEVER bug her with 'hi', 'hello', 'how are you?', 'How was your day?', 'Had Breakfast?', 'Had Lunch?', 'Had Dinner?', 'Had evening snacks?', 'Do you drink or smoke?' - basically any stupid question that makes her wonder if you are actually from this planet! These questions just put everything off! She might answer a few of your questions for courtesy sake, but remember - you are already added into her 'ignore' list.NEVER bug her again and again, if she has said ""NO"". She's not interested? Be a man, and move on! Don't run after her, and please - no crawling either!!Anything other than this, with a solid reason and good conversation skills can lead to a good friendship!

Mehek-Bassi,"LONELY!I am saying this, because I am in a long distance relationship, and we can't meet to celebrate birthdays or anniversary or any special day together, so I am basically single, and I feel really lonely. I believe that singles would also feel the same, so mostly I try to hangout with my single-friends, who actually ENJOY more than I can!Subconsciously, I always have this thing in my mind that I am committed to someone. I miss him, I can't see him, I can't visit him because he's very far away, and I can't spend any time with him, so I can't even enjoy myself, half of the time I am miserable because of his absence. I believe that is NOT the case with singles. They don't miss anyone! Missing a partner in general is one thing, but missing a specific person, and knowing that you can't do anything about it - it just kills you!And spending your 20s without a partner isn't that BAD! You first need to love yourself, before you can love anyone else. So if you are single right now - I suggest you to start enjoying your own company, and start dating your own self before you date someone else, because believe me - when you will fight with your partner or will miss him because of any reason, more than him you will miss yourself! I miss myself because I know I was NEVER this miserable before - and now I can't help it. LOL!So if you are single - ENJOY while you still can.

Mehek-Bassi,"Impressing someone is one thing, and falling in love is the other. But there's NOTHING as 'making someone fall in love with you'. It's something that purely coincidental, purely based upon the other person, and you have nothing to do with it. If she has to fall in love with you, she will, and if she doesn't like you that way, she won't ever like you that way EVER! So no matter how hard you try, things won't work out in the direction you want to steer them.However if you want to impress her, you can have 'interesting' conversations with her. Before talking to her from your side, know what 'her' interests lie in. Know what she's passionate about, and then find out information on that subject so that you have something common to talk about! Since you said she's open to everyone in class, so it's going to be a little tough to get her attention as there might be many, craving for it already, so you need to do something little extra! Once you know what her interest lies in, you can talk to her about those things, then you can move the conversation forward and tell her about what you like, and if she's interested in you, and your interests, you can take your friendship a step ahead and ask her out.

Mehek-Bassi,"Oh my God! This sounds totally like my story :PI am in a long-distance relationship since 2010 as well, and since last 3 months, even I'm having a very forced relationship I think.

I feel so pissed off and empty at times, but then I found a solution - 1. Be BUSY!If he has no time, you do more things in a day, and keep yourself busy so you don't feel empty and miserable all day long.2. SKYPE or FaceTime!Technology has one benefit and that is - we can see each other miles apart! Bring it to your use, select a day for video-call and make sure to have a video call on that day every week or every month, or whatever you decide. Make sure you are nicely dressed that day, so that he misses you more! He should also feel that there's something missing from his life, isn't it?3. Go out with your friends!Watch movies, hang out, basically have a life. I have realized this thing pretty hard way! I used to ignore everything and just sit in my room, doing my stuff, but that doesn't help. You need to socialize. You need to hang out, and then share your pictures with your guy, this way, you will befriend new people, meet new people, and have new things to talk about to your boyfriend! It will certainly renew your relationship!4. Play Games!As stupid as it may sound, but it works in bringing you closer and sparking up that lost magic! Write down a couple of questions that you would like to ask him sometime in life, but you don't think you have the guts to. Convert this entire questionnaire into a game and ask him to do the same! But make sure, that you make a rule of - NOT taking anything seriously after the game is over! Then ask each other some questions, and answer them to the best of your ability. They can be fun questions, sexy questions, random questions, but make sure NOT to include his/your past into it, if you have any. And not to include questions that you think can hurt the other person. Just make this game for FUN and pure FUN!5. Plan out dates!In Long Distance Relationship, it sounds like a very bad joke, but yes, you might plan out when you want to meet next, it can even be after 10 months or 1 year like in my case! That way, you have a hope. And when you have a hope, you can get things back on track. You can discuss what you will do on your next date, where you will want to go, and stuff like that. Even the thought of seeing each other, can heal you a lot! :)I think these 5 things will help you out a lot :) Just try them and be positive, nothing is wrong. It's just a phase, and it will pass.

Will her body be able to go through so many pregnancies and deliveries one after the other? Before DECIDING anything anonymously, consult with a good doctor, consult with your wife, and then talk to her about actually executing this plan! Moreover - saving for 5 kids, taking care of them, providing for their education and life in future - are you sure you can afford that? And even if you can - raising 5 kids can be a tough job. Don't think that they are going to be five chubby babies, they will grow up one day into teenagers, and then it will be the time of your real-examination, when they will start demanding freedom and independence, when they will step out in the world and you will have to provide them with money, cars, their individual vehicles and their respective pocket-money!

It's like reading a book that you've read already, in a hope that this time the end will change.Courageous - because not everyone can waste their time and energy on something as vague and random and fragile and what more can I say - painful, hurting and miserable thing as 'one-sided' love. Because someday, s/he will find someone else, and you will see them happy with their better half - and that will be painful! But, the best part is - you can't blame anyone, because you inflicted this pain on yourself - so you are responsible for what has happened! If you think Devdas was a hero? LOL no! Devdas was the biggest Loser of his time, who ditched a girl he loved, couldn't stop her from marrying someone else - when he could actually stop her, but attended her wedding like a grey-shaded character from mystery novels, he later spent his life in booze and prostitutes, and at the end, died in front of his lover's gate, thus making sure that even she can't have a peaceful life in her in-laws place!

He is busy, he has no time for thinking or planning all this, so he is content, because what he wants from you, he's getting it. But you, you want a lot more from him, and your expectations are being broken. First of all -Right now, you both are just dating and not living together, and every couple passes through this stage once the courtship period is over. The moment you will start living together or get married, you will feel that those emotions and feelings have bounced back again! It happens! You just have to be patient, give him and this relationship your time, and love and wait for things to happen at their pace.If you think breaking up will solve your problem, then let me tell you - You will come into a relationship with a new guy. He will love you, care for you and will be head over heels for you for a few months, just like this one, but then what? What after that? The same thing will happen. You will want this to continue forever, but sadly it can't. No matter how many relationships you get into, eventually this stage will arrive where the courtship period will be over and you will have to pass this phase. So it's better that instead of whining about it, just keep yourself busy, or plan things for him. That way, you will also have something or the other to do, and when he will see you doing efforts for him, he will love you back as well! That lost magic will be back again :) But don't think of breaking up, it's the stupidest mistake people make, blaming their partners that the relationship became boring or emotionless. While this stage will arrive in every relationship with every person of the world! You just have to stick together through your thick and thins - that is what a relationship is about, after all. Isn't it?I hope you pass this phase :) Be happy and don't expect too much. If you will keep your expectations low, you will always be happy even at little surprises, but if you will keep your expectations sky high, even big things won't be able to make you happy.

Mehek-Bassi,"No, not at all!But when you are in a relationship, you should focus more on 'why' than 'how-dare-he?'Have you asked him 'why' he decides the clothes that you wear? Or if your clothes look inappropriate to him? First 'know' the reason behind his decision, and then talk to him if you feel bad about him choosing your clothes. But first listen to him. Maybe he has a better reason, and maybe he wants you to dress decently?We girls wear what's in trend, and we like short crop-tops, spaghetti, shorts etc, but sometimes we forget that this is not the USA, but India, and here - clothes can lead to molestation and rapes too! It sounds absurd, because the girls in salwar-kameez also go through the same horror as the girls in jeans and shorts, but the girls who are in short/provocative clothes seem as 'easy-targets' for the molesters. I'm also an Indian girl, and I also feel equally frustrated when in summers, I can't wear shorts in a market-place or with my boyfriend on a date, just because this country is still living in dark-ages. If your clothing is inappropriate according to your boyfriend, talk to him about it. If he's asking you to wear the clothes of his choice, believe me - he loves you very much! No guy would care for any girl especially not her clothes, unless he respects her like his own mother, and only that guy respects his girlfriend like his mother, who truly loves her! If he was passing time with you, he won't care about what you wear and what not, he would rather encourage you to wear short-clothes so that you can be an eye-candy for him and his friends! But a guy who is serious for you, will never treat you like that.Feel lucky that you've got such a caring boyfriend, and do discuss things with him before being judgmental and rude to him for his decisions regarding your clothing or your life.

Mehek-Bassi,"Every girl's parents want a few things from the guy whom their daughter aspires to marry -He should LOVE her. He should be a MAN, and he should be a good man.He should NOT be after the dowry or moneyHe should take care of her, and take responsibility of herHe should be honest and truthful with them about everything from his lifeNow, let me explain these points a little - The man (son-in-law) should be loving and caring, he should respect their daughter, and love her, and take responsibility of her. He should stand for her rights in 'his' home after marriage, because it's their daughter who is leaving her home to get into theirs, and moreover it's the husband's duty to support wife. He should act like a man, and should be a good man! He should not be a mumma's boy like some guys are (who listen to their mothers more than wives and who fight with their wives because their mothers ask them to!). He should keep his private life with his wife 'separate' from his family life and relationships with the rest of the family. His wife should be his NUMBER 1 Priority after marriage (which is obvious!). IF you want to make a good impression on your girlfriend's parents, talk to them honestly about everything. Don't lie! Don't think that lying about your family, your job/business or your financial situation, will make a good impression on them. They are not sitting there to crack a business deal. They are hoping to make a new relationship with a man who is going to marry their daughter, and they expect him to be completely honest. Even if you have family problems - TELL THEM! So that they 'feel' that you are considering them close and a family now. So that they feel closer to you, and consider you also, as their family. Tell them about your family, how many siblings you have, how many people live in your house, where do you work etc. Apart from all this - tell them you are NOT interested in dowry or money (if you're honestly not! Remember - don't lie!). And tell them that marrying their daughter is your only wish in life, and not the money or dowry (only if you honestly don't want the money!). And tell them that you will love her, you will protect and care for her, and you will always stand by her side even in the times of dispute or arguments or fights in the family - because let's be honest here about one thing - NO RELATIONSHIP in the world is such, that it has no scope of disagreement. We all have fights and arguments, and it's a part of everyone's life, even those people who love each other. So, it's natural that after marriage there are 'chances' that there 'might' be an argument between your family members and your wife, in such a situation, a man is someone who is torn between the both, so you have to just and unbiased about it, and if your wife is right, you HAVE TO take her SIDE no matter if your own mother is on the other side. Tell her parents that no matter how much you earn right now, you will always make sure that their daughter has no problem/discomfort in living with you.If you talk to them politely and with respect, and tell them all the above mentioned stuff, I don't think there will be a problem. Good Luck! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"USA is comfortable compared to India. Better roads, cleaner environment, lesser pollution, more sophistication, better work culture etc. But there are some things that even USA can't guarantee, and can't even come close to if you compare it with India -Indian cultures, have love & respect. Something which USA doesn't have! Indians 'know' and CARE about even their neighbors, the people they work with, while in USA there is a lot of racism against Indians (no, not categorizing anything, but for someone who has been a victim of racism, it can be a BIG reason to leave USA and return to India! A place where he isn't judged because of his skin-color.)There is no comfort anywhere in the world, as it is in India particularly because of Indian foods! Food is a real BIG part of your life, and Indian food, spices, the oils and recipes are best known to Indian people. The 'Tunday' Kebab of Lucknow, the Paani-Puri from Delhi, the 'Vada Pav' from Mumbai, no country of the world can match that level! AND if someone is a BIG foodie, coming back to Indian can be his dream!Indian festivals! Diwali, Holi, Dussehere, Eid, Ganesh Chaturathi - all the colorful Indian festivals are enough for attracting people back home! And what's the fun of celebrating festivals without friends and family? It's a big reason for someone to return to their hometown, it gets really sad and lonely in other countries for Indians when their own country is celebrating Eid and Diwali!There is no better place than India when it comes to witnessing religious and cultural harmony! Indians are WAY EMOTIONAL than everyone else, because we love our families, we don't run out once we are 18. Some children are still living with their parents, despite they are 40-50 years old. There is no rush of leaving your parents alone here. The joint-family culture is still alive. Grandparents don't see their grandchildren on weekends, they wake up with them, play with them, sleep with them, and grandchildren KNOW what grandparents are. They don't see them as a bunch of oldies, they respect them, they love them. We value our culture, we value our tradition and we value the love we have for each other. Ones motherland is ones own after all. No matter where you go on a vacation, eventually you come back home, right? And India is HOME to every Indian. No matter where he goes and even settles down, inside he will always crave for his home, his place, his people, his family. Home is home after all...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"I think I pretty much qualify to answer this question.I came into relationship with my guy in late-2010, and within 6 months of our relationship, his whole family relocated to a new city and since then, till the date, we are in long distance! Earlier I had many doubts, especially when I would see other couples hanging out, spending time together, doing things for each other, for me, my relationship was more or less only virtual. We used to see each other on Skype, talk to each other on Phone and write each other messages. Since his whole family knows about me, so there was never a problem in keeping up the communication, but the meetings were limited. He visited my city only around his birthday or mine. We never celebrated any birthday on our actual 'birth-date' together, but we would always make sure that either before or after the birthdays we had to meet, that was something decided when we were ripped apart by distance!But I can tell you the best things about being in a long distance relationship:The distance makes you value each other so much more than you can imagine! You can love and value a person by living with him, but you realize the actual value, only when you know you can't see him everyday. You make every single date SPECIAL! The excitement to meet your partner after a long-gap, just makes everything 'awesome'. You can't experience this thing in a regular relationship.The nervousness is still there, even after 4-5 years. I still can't completely be myself in front of him, and I know that awkwardness will go away only once we are married. And I believe it's a good thing!The awkwardness or nervousness, whatever you call it - is a good thing, why? Because the intimacy is very less, and so the excitement is way more. It will be like a whole new thing, and a whole new start to our relationship 'after' we get married!We keep on discovering things about each other even after 5 years of dating. I can't say I know him 100%, neither can he, because we change so much with everyday, and when we meet each other after months, we notice those little changes very strikingly, and it never gets boring!You never know what will happen next! The element of surprises and getting-surprised in a long-distance relationship is quite high, because couples usually have 'low' expectations because of the distance!You can do a lot of stuff that couples in regular relationships can't, and the best one is - writing letters! Here are a couple of letters I sent to him on his birthday this year. We can't meet for another year, so I wrote him 23 letters for his 23rd Birthday!AND the absolute joy when he receives the letters and sends a picture back saying that he loved his birthday present!!!Life can be hard or easy, all that matters is - How you handle it! It doesn't matter if there's distance between a couple, if they are true, loyal, understanding and caring for each other, nothing else matters! There are couples who are living a life of lie with each other, isn't it better to be in long-distance and know that a person loves you, and only 'you', than living with someone who can't be loyal? I believe, distance is just a 'number', if you are willing to be together in life, if you love him and want him, your life will walk in the direction of bringing you together! So, if you are deciding to breakup because of long-distance relationship - THINK AGAIN. You might be leaving someone who loves you dearly, but can't be with you at the moment - for someone who might be with you all the time, but can't love you as much as the other person can!Good Luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"You CANNOT change a mentality. This has happened with me too, and I'm sure many other girls have witnessed this silent harassment many times over on their social networking accounts, but that's something we have to deal with. Since the guy is on the other side of the screen, we can't go and slap him or kill him, though it feels like killing them when they start with their disgusting questions! But All we can do is - IGNORE them and move on. There's no use of replying or arguing or fighting with such men, they are just looking for something 'exactly' alike! And by arguing, we are doing nothing, but wasting our time on people who are worthless!Changing a mentality is by far an impossible thing because men who think they are above women, or they dominate women, or they are superior, will NOT stop thinking so unless they really witness something that makes them believe in gender-equality. Until that day, we can only hope that things change, but they won't. In North India (especially Gurgaon-Delhi-Noida the NCR Belt), you can't go out alone after 9 or 10 pm. It's so unsafe! Some pervert men living in that belt, don't they know this thing? They know it! But have they changed themselves? NO! They rather prey for single/lonely girls at evening, and touch them inappropriately or pass lewd comments or rape them if they get a chance. Are those men not having a family of their own? They have! What drives such mentality is their mindset, which has a firm belief of treating women as inferiors. They treat their own mothers-sisters and wives as slaves. They will never allow them to wear modern clothes or allow them to go out alone after evening. Their regressive thinking is responsible for lecherous mentality that has been highly responsible in a hike in crime against women! And when they see a girl partying out or even walking on street alone after late evening, their superior-ego is hurt and they will rape her - to CORRECT her! The Delhi gangrape that happened in a bus on 16th December, and the BBC documentary on it - which showcased that even after two years of jail-sentence, the convicts don't feel that they did a wrong thing. They still think, whatever they did was to correct the girl, so that no girl dares step out of their homes after 8 pm with a male-friend!And the perverts we meet online are no different! Just that they can't do any physical harm to girls on internet, saves us from the horror, otherwise, it would be the same scenario as on the NCR streets in the midnight!I will not say it's the girl's fault to be modern, outgoing, open-minded, but the guy's fault who believe that a woman should be veiled and covered and stay inside the home! They don't want to see women competing with men or even getting successful. They can't see women having a good life, they want them to stay under men, and serve them, rather than having a life of their own! The Uber-Cab rape case revealed this mentality, when the driver said he raped the woman who called the cab - because she was wearing modern clothes and she was returning from a high-class party! He said he was a man, and just a driver, and how dare a woman rise above him, in social and financial status? That drove him crazy and he raped her!So, if you are answering openly about sex, menstruation, or any topic that's a taboo in India, you have to expect some perverts sending you filthy texts! It's something that's inevitable and unavoidable, because the society we live in, has still a long way to go, especially in accepting that women are as capable of doing anything as men! And some men think that if a woman is discussing such topics - she is automatically a slut. She is there only to get someone into her pants and so they just attack when they see such a girl! What they fail to realize is that - this is a modern society, and talking about sex, does NOT make you a slut!Just keep such men at bay. Ignore them. You have a much better life than they can even dream of! Have a nice day :) <3",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Depends upon if ""YOU"" want to make it last long :) I've seen many long-distance relationships turning into beautiful marriages, that lasted longer than anything else! I can narrate two stories here that will clear your doubt:My grandparents were introduced by their families and mutual friends and relatives, back in mid-1940s, they were about to get married too, but eventually catastrophe struck and there was a war in 1947 between India that lead to formation of Pakistan. Both my grandparents originally belonged to Lahore and Punjab (now in Pakistan), and since they were Hindus, they had to run away to save their lives! They were only engaged, not married, but had become good friends eventually in that time. In those times there were no phones or means to stay in touch, even letters were not reliable as in the war times, everything was disrupted. My grandfather was around 11-12 years old and my grandmother was even younger (7-8). Weddings used to happen early in those times and child-marriages were common in India. My grandfather's father (my great-grandfather), lost his life during partition while their journey, and my grandfather acquired his government job after a year or so once they safely reached India, but there was no news about my grandmother yet. Almost ten years later, they were introduced by fate again, this time in Pathankot (Punjab - India) where my grandmother was teaching in a school and my grandfather was 'posted' there as a telephone-operator (That was his government job). Mother of my grandmother was a 'sarpanch' in the same village at that time and she educated all her children after partition. They finally got married in 1960 (when they were in their early twenties) and shifted to Ludhiana (and settled there permanently). It's amazing, shocking and unbelievable today, but that was the love they had for each other. IT can't be called exactly a long-distance relationship for many reasons (the biggest being - they were not in touch and totally unaware of each other's whereabouts), but since they are together practically since their childhood, I can't think of it to be anything else, but only a long-distance relationship that was connected by two hearts, and worked out better than 99% of relationships of this generation!That's a picture from their 50th Wedding Anniversary (Golden Jubilee) -And the SECOND story is my own -I am from a digital age (obviously), and in a long-distance relationship with my guy since 5 years now. We feel disgusting at times for not being together, and lucky at times to value each other so much when we finally meet after a gap of 6 months or a year! I'm studying (in Ludhiana) and he's working in Bombay. There are limited dates, but we skype each other, call, message, text and even write letters. And when we meet, we have so much to talk about! There's not even a single date with my guy that I found boring or worthless, it's always special. Everything with him is special NOT because he's a great-guy or I'm a great-girl - WE BOTH have our FLAWS, we both are imperfect, we both make mistakes, we argue, fight, yell at each other too, but at the end of the day - we have each other. We never go to bed angry, we make sure that no matter how bad the fight is, we will NOT start a new day with past-regrets or fights, and this single promise has made our lives easier! Before being my boyfriend, he has always been my best-friend & that is what I love about him. So far, if I can summarize my relationship of past 5 years with him in 3 words, it would be - Roller Coaster Ride!Managing long-distance relationships is HARD, but when you know that the person is 'worth-the-wait', there's no if or but then. There is just 'DO IT or LEAVE IT.' Handling LDRs is hard, but if you can manage to take it to marriage, nothing in your life can be a better investment than that! There's no reason to breakup with your guy/girl just because of distance. The distance will eventually end someday when you will be married, but what matters is the love. If there's love, go for it. If he respects you, cares for you, is loyal to you and trusts you, there's no reason for ending it. It might be hard to sail in a rocking ship in the middle of the ocean, but one day, you will get to the shore, and then when you will look back into the ocean - the journey will look adventurous and totally worth it! Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"In Hinduism - we are taught to be God-Loving, not God-Fearing! I am born a Hindu, and even if I was born into any other religion, I'm sure I would have been inclined towards Hinduism as much as I am today. We have awesome festivals with awesome food, as some of the people have already mentioned in the answers on this thread.Apart from festivals and food, we are free to choose any God! I worship Lord Krishna, while my father is a devotee of Shiva, my mother believes in Lord Ram, and my brother is a Hanuman-bhakt! We are a family of four, believing in 4 different Gods, and there has never been a conflict over it because that's what Hinduism teaches you - to be tolerant and accepting!Hindu mythologies are BETTER than the books we are getting in Indian-Literature section these days! I would prefer reading stories from Mahabharata or Ramayana any day over reading any college love story with sex and alcohol involved (90% of the books have this similar sounding plot!). The stories from Mahabharata and Ramayana are not only well versed, but they also come with a Moral! I'm amazed at the fact that Hinduism has scientific explanation to many of the beliefs we follow like - surya-namaskar in the morning, married women applying sindoor (vermilion) in their hair-partition, folding hands to greet someone (Namaste) and many other beliefs that we practice in an everyday life, they all have a meaning and a purpose and an explanation that even scientists today, agree with!ABOVE all, I love Hinduism because there is NO discrimination on the base of GENDER or SEX. Females are considered to be equal to males! We have as many Goddesses in Hinduism as Gods - Goddess Lakshmi, Kaali, Durga, Vaishno, Naina Devi, Jwala-Devi, Chamunda Devi, Raadha, Seeta etc. Ladies are treated with respect in Hindu households, there are no restrictions that are imposed upon us. We can do whatever we want to, study as much as we want to, and enjoy our lives as much as we want to! Certainly, Muslim-women don't enjoy that privilege in some rigid-Islamic states!Calling Hinduism a RELIGION would be wrong - it's a way of life that was practiced tens of thousands of years ago. People living around Sindhu river were called 'Hindus' and their way of life was highly liberal, open, tolerant and very accepting. They all were CONVERTED later into Muslims or Christians or Jains or other religions, earlier they practiced Hinduism. And the best thing about Hinduism is - THERE is no law or method for any kind of forceful conversion! You are a Hindu -If you are born a Hindu and you want to practice itIf you WANT to be a Hindu, so you ADAPT it as your lifestyle with your OWN WISH! (Like many foreigners have done it)No forceful conversion, no gun-point vows and no horror! You can't be converted unless you want it. And if you want it, you are free to adapt it. If you visit ancient cities of Varanasi or Vrindavan, you will find many people who are native-Americans or hail from UK or any other country of the world, they are living in India, worshiping Hindu Gods and preaching Hinduism!Apart from all this - another thing I love about Hinduism is - the amazing Ganga-Aarti! If you ever witness Ganga-Aarti in Haridwar at 07 pm especially in cold months like December or January, you can't really go back to your normal life without being awed and amazed at it!Thanks :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"You can convince her parents, but it might need a lot of courage! So, if you have guts and a pair of balls, only then go for it, otherwise drop the idea.You might need to do a lot of things in order to convince her parents, and that involves MEETING THEM too. She doesn't want you to try? How will anything happen without it? Can she talk and convince her parents? If yes, then good, but if not, you MUST go and talk to them, and not just sit and watch your girlfriend marry someone else, that's horrible! You need to do a lot of things, starting from -Ability to talk - Not just TALKING, you have to convince them that marriage is NOT about money! Tell them that you are working in a MNC and planning to start a company too, and if they marry their daughter, you can get rich within a few years down the line. Loans will be paid off side by side, that's nothing to worry about, you just need to be confident that you can do it, and that confidence should reflect in your talks, so that her father is forced to think about it! If they refuse to marry her to you - tell them - ""What if I get rich in a few years and the guy you marry your daughter to, is working in my company? Money is all about destiny. I can get rich overnight, and if you think the guy you will find for your daughter will always 'remain' rich, that's also highly dependent on his destiny. Neither you, nor anyone can guarantee someone's future! What if tomorrow I become a millionaire? Then will you regret not marrying your daughter with me?"" Remember - all this has to be spoken with UTMOST confidence and a lot of politeness. He's a girl's father after all!Presenting Yourself - When you go to meet her family, dress up nicely. They should know that doesn't matter if you earn less, your lifestyle is good! You are not a miserable poor person who won't keep their daughter happy. Your dressing, your attitude will show what kind of person you are! For a girl's parents, nothing is important than the happiness of their child.Discussing Future - Don't be shy to discuss your future with your prospective in-laws. Tell them what you have planned and tell them how do you 'plan' to make things work out, how do you plan to repay the loans and how do you plan to start a company, what amount have you saved, how much you need etc etc etc. All this will do nothing, but increase your respect in their eyes, because there's nothing better than marrying a daughter to a 'man' who knows how to handle his life! A man with a plan sounds a great deal.Don't ask for DOWRY - I don't know if you are planning to seek some financial help from your in-laws or not, but if you 'don't' ask for any money, it will be awesome! A girl's father needs nothing, but his girl's happiness and a contentment in his heart that he has married her to the ""right"" person who is not greedy and will not bother her for money in future! Tell her parents that you don't need even a penny on wedding but their blessings - this one emotional line is SURE to impress them!Do all this, and I'm sure a great deal of your problem will be solved.",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"I experienced severe bullying in my college when I was in 2nd year. Right now, I'm in final year, and yes - I still see that guy usually roaming around, but whenever he looks at me, he lowers down his gaze and I know that the lesson I taught him will stay with him forever!So, the story goes back to 2013 to Social Media (Facebook) where I shared my views and opinions about 'Eminem's raps being abusive and filthy', that he didn't like, and he wrote an offensive and abusive 'rap' for me, and shared it among his classmates and friends. I didn't know the guy, as he was 'not-added' in my Facebook ID, but he was 'following' me because I published a book in the very same year, and I instantly became pretty much popular with college teachers and the cultural groups (that is something that happens when you do anything out of the ordinary! Publishing a book in 2nd year did that to me). So, that guy, wrote a rap against me for no reason, and shared it on college groups and pages, and the next thing I know is - my friends sending me links of that filthy piece of shit! I was shocked upon how could someone fall so low? What if I don't like Eminem? I still don't like him, but that's my personal choice! How can anyone feel so offended when he doesn't even know Eminem personally? The entire matter sounded like a joke over all, but the repercussions it brought along were pretty serious. Very soon I found myself targeted openly by even juniors who were sharing that filthy-rap on their facebook accounts, and making fun of me. That was the time I thought I should step up and do something about it.I told my boyfriend about the matter, and he asked me to ignore it. I ignored it till the bully somehow got my number and started calling me, sending me filthy texts on whatsapp and abusing me over messages. When I told about it to my guy, he was enraged and asked me for his number. He passed the number on to his friends, and every guy he knew in his college. They all started calling him and abusing him, with full 'maa-behen' going on in the calls. The guy was so pissed off, that he posted about 'this-incident' on Facebook saying that I have hired some 'goons' to make him learn a lesson! I didn't respond anywhere on social media. It was getting sicker! Sharing number and passing it wasn't doing any good, so I thought about the next big-step.The first thing I did after this was - bring my parents in it. I told my dad and my uncle about it all, I even told them how I shared his number with my friends and they all have been abusing him and asking him to stop, but he's not listening, and they agreed to accompany me to the director's office the next week (as college was closed for a few days at that time due to Diwali). The next Monday, my father, my uncle both of them accompanied me to the Director's office, where I showed all the screen-shots of the shit he has been writing against me since 10 days. The idea of my boyfriend to 'ignore' everything and 'don't-respond' worked strongly in my favor when the Director asked the guy that why was he writing shit, when I wasn't even saying anything to him at all? I said nothing to him EVER! Just that one Eminem-status post was enough for him to lose his mind, and the Director was laughing at the guy's immaturity. The next thing my uncle did was call Police Commissioner's PA (who is my uncle's best friend), and he asked the guy talk to the PA. For all I could sense, the guy almost peed in his pants as he was apologizing and saying sorry again and again and refusing to talk to the PA! Director then asked the guy to write an apology to me for all that he did, he even asked him to 'write-down' the rap in the letter and also state at the end, that if he's found in any nonsense again in future, he will be rusticated from college without any prior warning! I got to take the pictures of the letter, and I shared it all over social media. That was something that shut-up all the college juniors and seniors and kids who were earlier sharing his raps.Behaving maturely and sensibly, I deleted that apology letter after a few days, when the matter cooled down, and now whenever I see that guy, he can't face me or look me in the eyes anymore! And whenever any student asks me about 'what actually happened', I say it was a nightmare, and that it's over now.PS: I am in final year of college now, and I'm going to be a pass-out in another 6 months. I am not the kind of person who would keep grudges forever, so I have even decided that on the final day of college, I'd talk to him, and make things alright, because that's something that will give 'me' contentment. I don't want to leave this place with any regrets or remorse or grudge against someone.",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Coming to the problem:You have to get married someday, isn't it? May that be arranged marriage or love marriage. You will eventually get married someday. And after marriage, won't you have sex with the guy? If you will NOT do it, your PARENTS will be the ones to force you to do it in order to maintain a healthy relationship! And if you have to do it anyways in life, then why think about all this?If you really love your partner, you can have intimacy with him. It's something that is even mentioned in the vedas of Ramayana and Mahabharata time. If you look back in Indian history, sex is treated as a very holy practice, and we come from the land of Kamasutra! It's WE people who have criminalized it and dirtied it with our polluted mentality. Physical intimacy is as important in a relationship as 'talking'. You talk to your partner everyday, right? But if you won't be physically intimate with him for six months or a year, you will witness tensions, fights, arguments, problems, and he may even get interested in some other girl because of your behavior and the solution is nothing, but intimacy. And there is NOTHING wrong with intimacy as long as you don't end up getting pregnant, and since you said you are not going to have 'sex', but just kissing and making out, I don't think there is anything wrong with it at all. Ultimately, if you get married to your guy, won't you do it then? Being loyal to your partner is something that is of utmost priority in the relationship, AFTER 'caring for his happiness', and if his happiness lies in kissing you or hugging you, what's the harm in it? Let him love you! Don't shoo his love away. There are women, who are dying for getting some love from their partners, but they don't.Feeling guilty is normal because hailing from Indian traditional families, it happens. We are taught to see these things are 'wrong' things and we are always taught to stay away from all this. But one fine day, our parents find a guy for us, and ask us to sleep with him naked! That's the biggest HYPOCRISY of all! First asking all the girls to 'not' talk to any stranger, and then marrying her to a stranger and asking her to have 'sex' with him! Physical intimacy is something that everyone has to indulge in at some point of time, and at that time, will you ask your parents about it? OR will you feel guilty about doing it? And marriage is just a 'documented' proof that you can sleep with a particular man, no matter if you love him or not. So I don't think getting married has anything to do with expressing your love! Marriage is just a documentation, while love is an emotion that you express with your actions, may it be a hug or a kiss or sex. There is nothing wrong as long as you don't do something that poses difficulty for you or your partner in your relationship, like getting pregnant. Otherwise, it's all fine!Don't think much, you might end up losing a really good guy because of this guilt. And if he respects you enough, he loves you, he cares for you, and he wants to marry you (in future), then there's no harm in giving some love back...Take Care!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"I can't disagree with your question, as I also think the same. There are many cases of FAILED and DECEITFUL arranged marriages in my family, where in some cases the girl revealed that she is still in love with her 'ex' boyfriend, in some cases the girl simply fled away with her ex after 6 months of marriage, in some cases the guy was in love with 40 yrs old woman and he married my cousin because of family pressure, and in some cases the guy was 'gay' who simply married to save the family-dignity.Whoever says that having 'sex' or children 'strengthens' the bond are fucking stupid! It does NOTHING, but rather adds complications, and after a child, your life is nothing but a big compromise, where you can't divorce the person because the child's life will juggle between separate parents and it will make your kid's life hard, so the idea of divorce is shunned away. They ask you to have 'children' simply so that you cannot take a divorce!And whoever says that well-verified arranged marriages are successful, don't know that this is 21st Century. Lies and cheating is common. In this technological era, you can't say what is true and what is false, and even if you inquire about the prospective groom or bride, the relatives and friends or that person will always say that s/he is the best man/woman of the world! Obviously they have to get them married, why will they say that they are bad or have any bad habits? Like in the case of my one cousin whose husband turned out to be 'gay'. His entire family knew that the guy is homosexual, but they still got him married, she came home after a year since the guy didn't touch her for one year and when she demanded the reason he revealed he has a boyfriend and can't be disloyal to him. My cousin is still sitting at home and the alliances that she's getting now are from the men who are either divorced or widowed or have kids already. My cousin who had 'no-marriage', no sex at all, no bachelor guy is ready to marry her just because she was married for one year to a man, and nobody is ready to believe that the marriage wasn't real. It's been 5 years she's sitting at her home, and now she's so much in depression because of whatever happened to her, that she is taking psychological treatments! One arranged marriage, destroyed her life! And the guy, her husband (the gay man), he was well known and son of best friend of the girl's father. They got her married because they had seen the guy grow up in front of their eyes, but when things opened out, everyone was shocked!",high,high,high,low,low

How can they (or anyone) guarantee that the Jain guy they are going to find for you won't turn out to be a jerk in future? How can they (or anybody) guarantee that he will respect you and not hit you? That he will be good with you, and won't turn out to be some maniac in future? Who can guarantee these things? And if you are going to leave your boyfriend (whom you know) for someone whom you don't know - I don't need to tell you what your future will be! You are choosing something that you've no idea about, OVER something that you know well that is good enough for you!What is important for spending life? Money? City? House which is made of bricks and cement? Or LOVE? Money - you can earn good amount for yourself in future and you can even save a lot! City - you can always shift to bigger city and convince your guy to shift, if he gets a good job offer, it's not like someone is gluing you to one city for the rest of your life! Home - what if he's from a middle-class family? Not everyone is born rich! If Gauri Khan would have rejected SRK because he's from another religion, and didn't make enough money as her retired colonel father, she would be with some middle-class Hindu boy today, and not with a Muslim Super-star who is Bollywood's richest actor! Let's not even discuss their lifestyle today, as you know it too!If you marry the Jain guy found by your parents, and he divorces you in future, or there are problems between you two - WILL YOUR PARENTS ACCEPT THEIR MISTAKE? Ask them! Will they admit it that they were wrong? And what if they admit it? Will that change your life? You can't let someone else take decisions of your life, especially not the decision related to marriage! That's plain stupid. You are a graduate from IIT, you are qualified enough to understand all this, before someone else comes to convince you!The biggest thing - in India, marriage doesn't happen between a guy and a girl but between two families. What if the Jain-guy found by your parents, his family doesn't love you as much as your boyfriend's family does? Will you be able to live with such a big compromise all your life? What if the mother-in-law scolds you and taunts you for no reason? What if they don't let you work in future? What if they impose certain restrictions on you? Your degree from IIT won't save you in such conditions!I believe you are qualified enough to understand what's right and what's not. And convincing your parents for marriage is NOT a tough task. There are many cases where the guy/girl fail to convince their parents and spend their entire lives as an ""adjustment"" trying to love the partner their parents found. Same thing happened with a cousin (female) of mine. Her boyfriend wasn't approved by my uncle and aunt, and she was forcefully married to this guy, who was just ""okay"" compared to her boyfriend, who loved her more than anything! And her husband won't let her use facebook or whatsapp or anything, fearing that she might get in touch with her 'ex' somehow. Now her life is nothing more than a compromise. She can't work, she can't use social media, she can't do anything. She says all the time, that had she fought for her love, her entire life would be something else today! While her boyfriend, he shifted to USA a few years back and married someone else. He's the coolest guy anyone can never get! And certainly my cousin did a huge mistake by letting him go, and settling for this crap-bag who doesn't allow her anything at all!So good luck for your life, and marriage is a BIG thing. Don't let it just 'happen' because of someone else's sake. Fight for it. Die for it. But don't settle for something that you know you don't deserve!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"It's a tradition!In Punjabi it is called ""waarna"". It symbolizes 'blessings'. The money is thrown over them, and later given to the poor. It is believed that the blessings of poor people are the strongest, and so the needy and poor are given huge amounts of money on any wedding function or on birth of a baby so that they bless the couple or the baby with the purest heart and that the couple can start a new life or the baby can have a healthy life ahead! There is also another belief associated with it - When the bride leaves her home after the wedding ceremony, she throws back rice without looking behind. It is done to ensure that her family has good financial condition even after she leaves. In North-India a girl-child is considered to be an incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth and money), so when she leaves the house to join her husband's house, she throws back rice to ensure that her family doesn't face any kind of problems financially. And the money is rotated over the newly wed-couple to bless them that they don't have any financial issue in their new life, and that their life starts off on good-terms!There is another custom that is followed when the bride enters the groom's house for the first time after wedding. A roll of coins is thrown over them by the groom's aunts and the bride is then asked to take out money from an earthen-pot. It is done to make sure that the groom and bride have a life full of richness and financial stability. And since the new bride is considered the incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi, so she is offered 'money' right at the doorstep! It is like offering ""Laddoos"" to Lord Ganesha! It is done to ensure that Goddess Lakshmi blesses their life and family.",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"A girl aiming a rich guy for marriage!A guy aiming for good career can fail 100 times, 1000 times, let's say a million times, but he will anyhow achieve it if he really wants! It's probability is at least a thousand times higher than a girl aiming to marry a rich guy.Let's assume the girl married a rich guy, and the guy became bankrupt next month or next year, or maybe a natural calamity struck and all his property vanished away, or maybe his business ran into losses, and if he has inherited his wealth from his forefathers, he might not even be so passionate about working hard and making a career at all! He can't understand the value of money, because he is born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and since that the girl has married him now, can that mistake be corrected? NO! So once the marriage is done, it's all upon fate what happens.But if you compare both - middle class guy getting rich v/s girl aiming to marry a rich guy, the former has higher probability of happening because a rich guy may or may not be rich for his entire life, but a middle class man CAN get rich easily if he is focused and determined about it!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Loving someone too much can become a poison if that love isn't returned!Returning love or expecting love in return might sound cheap right now, but let's admit, everyone expects their partner to love them back as much as they love them! It's the truth. We might say that we don't need his/her love, and that we can survive only by ""giving"" love, but that's not the case. Loving someone is the best feeling of the world, especially when that person loves you back too, but if you love her way too much, or are obsessed for her, man you need to stop and think a few things over -What are the chances that you will marry? If they are very high, and you are sure, your families have agreed, then go ahead loving her as much as you can!What are the chances that she will take 'your' side if her family goes against this alliance in future? If you are 100% sure that she loves you that much, then go ahead and keep loving her.But if there is a second thought in above two situations, then you need to think about it. Ask yourself are you prepared if she leaves you? Will you be able to handle yourself if she breaks-up? Will you prevent yourself from killing yourself or diverting towards suicidal plans if she leaves you? There are many other questions that you can ask yourself but these are the foremost ones. If the answer to all of them is 'NO', then you need to be mentally prepared, because actually 'future' is unpredictable, and anything can happen. Don't be so sure, a junior of me committed suicide after his girlfriend of 2 years, left him for another guy. He was my college-mate, and for 1 year he kept convincing everyone that he was fine, but one day, in the month of June/July this year, the college juniors found him dead in his hostel bed, with a letter written for his girlfriend that had she not left him, he would still be alive! The girl actually shifted to Delhi for her college and the guy was in my college (Punjab) so they came into a Long distance relationship, but the girl found a new guy in Delhi and left her boyfriend, who ended up killing himself!If you are sure you won't take any such extreme step if she leaves you, then it's fine, but if not, you need to prepare yourself mentally, and start maintaining a safe-distance so that you are not too much attached that it becomes impossible to leave her! Your girlfriend's fears are genuine, as she is not that much in love with you as you are, she might fall for you eventually with time, but right now, she obviously is scared that if she leaves you or you guys breakup for any reason in future, you will end up taking some drastic step, which she doesn't want! So, talk things out with your girlfriend, and be sensible and mature. Loving someone is great, all roses and rainbows, but when they leave you, you should NOT be so empty that you can't breathe. You should be able to pull yourself together, and handle the breakup, and not take some extreme step and kill yourself.If you prepare yourself mentally enough, that you are ready to live without her, after that you can be in the relationship fearlessly. You won't fear that you'll die if she'll breakup or leave you. And if you guys end up separate and apart, you will thank yourself for being mature and sensible enough, and if you end up marrying each other, you can let go of the distance then! But unless things are not 100% official and final, don't put yourself in any extreme...Good luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Since you didn't mention whether you were looking for a 'real' story or a 'fiction' one, but I have a story I wrote quite long ago. It's about India v/s Pakistan war, and how a war-hero is treated in both countries. Here it goes:                                      JAWAAN - Story of an Army-ManMARTYR: A person who is killed because of his religious, or national, or other beliefs. Day-74Twinkling like distant stars, her beautiful eyes glimmered,My heart raced and with every breath, she was nearing me,A tear escaped her gloomy eyes, and on her cheek it shimmered,She wiped it off, bid me a good-bye with a promise to see,Me in good health, once again, me in her arms, once again… The poetry was sad and depressing. Ahmed kept the diary back on the shelf, thinking of it to be a lost property. The colonel called him again for a check on all the injured Indian soldiers. He took a brisk walk towards the tattered camp, and witnessed so many dead bodies, lying around like a pile of yesterday’s stale food, which had no significance today.His heart skipped a beat, as he saw some injured Indian soldiers fighting and struggling for their lives in those filthy camps on the Jammu and Kashmir border area. The bombing was over, but the war was still on. Just like the Indians, the Pakistanis had also captured some prisoners of war, and those surviving with difficulty were one of them.‘Please…’ someone from the camp spoke up. Ahmed rushed in to check who it was.It was an Indian captain, the name plate was not present, his uniform was torn from places and his right leg was completely dismembered due to bombings. He had some serious injuries over his chest and shoulder area, but still, the man was strong enough to talk.‘What happened?’ Ahmed tried to behave coldly and stone-heartedly.‘Kill me…’ the Indian soldier, spoke up with dignity. He knew that living here would mean a disgrace to his own nation, and he would be considered a traitor.‘I can’t. I have orders to keep you alive.’ Ahmed was a junior official, he didn’t know much about the rules and regulations as he was new in the Pakistan-Army, but all he knew was, disobeying his seniors could cost him much more than he could imagine. He got up with an emotionless face, and walked out of the camp.‘Major, a captain in the camp is asking me to kill him. He’s badly injured, and I don’t think he’ll survive farther than today…’ Ahmed courageously spoke up.The Major flared up, and ordered him to keep his suggestions and remarks to himself. He was still a junior and had a lot to learn, providing suggestions to the senior officials wasn’t his job. Ahmed immediately shut up and walked back to his duty, of keeping a check on the captured Indian soldiers.In the evening, he was back to his own tent, and he again picked up that lonely diary from the war. He flipped some pages and reached to page number 75, from where he left in the evening. Day-75I talked to her for the seventh time. On phone, she’s shy, maybe because we’re recently married, but in letters, she’s pretty outspoken and open. I asked her about her openness in letters and her introvert behavior on phone. She replied, she’s nervous and afraid. I couldn’t stop myself from laughing, but she thinks I’m a serious man with a disciplined life, so I won’t like her jokes and light-hearted talks over the phone. But something which truly made me happy today was her letter, which arrived just a few moments back. Something that forced me to add up an event to this diary, and that was her signature at the end. She signed it by writing ‘I Love You…’‘Dinner is ready!’ the cook called out everyone from their camps, and Ahmed ran down, shutting the diary closed and keeping it safely in the inner pocket of his coat.After the dinner, he couldn’t wait to rush to his tent and once again start reading the diary, but he heard some noises from the camps where Indian soldiers were captured. They were too weak and injured to resist, then what was all this sudden noise about? Everyone was busy in dinner, at one corner, but Ahmed rushed down towards the camps to see if everything was alright.As he entered tent number 12, he saw that same Indian captain who was pleading to kill him, crawling down on floor with his half cut leg, and badly bleeding injuries.‘What are you doing? You’re not supposed to be here…’‘Why are you saving me? Call some of your heartless men, who can just kill me in one go, why are you always around?’ The captain was irritated with Ahmed saving his life again and again.‘I don’t know anything, you’re supposed to rest, that’s all I know!’ Ahmed put him back on his bed, and covered him up. He again pierced the syringes into his veins and covered his chest with some band aids.‘I don’t want to live a life in one of your prisons, nor do I want to return to my homeland, being a crippled and burden for my family. Just kill me and end it all!’Ahmed chose to remain silent. He knew, talking with a Prisoner of War could be dangerous, and moreover, his seniors would fire him anytime now, as he had already done so many blunders.As he was about to leave, the diary fell on the floor, making a sound that woke up the captain.‘Where did you get it?’ the captain asked.‘It was lying in the captured items from the other side, there are beautiful poems inside it!’‘Give it back to me, that’s mine!’Ahmed was awestruck for a moment. The captain who was pleading him to end his life, had a newlywed wife at his home, still his love for his nation dominated his love for his family.‘Is this really yours?’‘Yes, it is. On the front page, there would be my name, Captain Mohan Pratap Singh.’ The captain spoke weakly. All his memories of his bride were fresh now, a tear escaped his eye, and he turned his face to the other side to avoid the Pakistani soldier’s sight.Ahmed flipped over some pages and reached the front cover, he was right, Mohan Pratap Singh, was embarked on the diary and even the date was mentioned, which was barely 3 months ago.‘When did you get married?’‘Last month, why?’ Captain asked angrily. He wanted the guy to kill him, instead of torturing him more with his past.Ahmed didn’t speak anything, but silently walked out. He stood outside the tent and the captain himself didn’t say anything. Ahmed turned to page 75, from where he left and started his poetic journey once again. The only difference this time was, the writer himself was lying injured and on the death bed, in front of him, which was making it all the more difficult for him to read further. He cried and read, and cried again.Soon, he reached the last text of the diary, at some pages there were poems, at some, small textual paragraphs. Day-89I never thought the war would start, and that I have to leave my bride to serve the nation. But I’m feeling proud today. The feeling of being a true soldier has surrounded me and it’s time to fulfil the purpose of my birth. If you’re reading this, then that would probably mean that I’m not alive, because someone will own my possessions, only after my death. This diary belongs to Captain Mohan Pratap Singh, please return it to my wife, Roshni, who is waiting for my return. I’m sorry Roshni, please forgive me for shattering all your dreams…As Ahmed finished reading the last line, a feeble squeal was heard and he rushed inside. The Captain was lying on the floor with his hand on his heart. He died the death of a true martyr, sacrificing his life for his nation, and serving his purpose.Ahmed informed his senior officials about his demise, and they scolded him for not doing his duty properly. Three Months LaterIt was a dim lit room, with just one window covered with curtains, barely allowing any light to come inside. A woman, in her mid-twenties was sitting on the bed, with her head held in her hands.‘Roshni, daughter…there’s a parcel for you…’ her mother-in-law called her.She walked outside slowly, wiping off her tears and pushing back memories of her deceased husband, Captain Mohan Pratap Singh.It was a big envelope, addressed to Roshni. As she saw the sender’s address, the parcel fell off her hands. It was from Karachi, Pakistan. She started crying badly, knowing that the war ended the life of her husband. But she was also the widow of a martyr, knowing the honor of such a title, made her feel proud inside, and she accepted the parcel with dignity and pride.Inside, in her room, she opened it, and found an old, dirty looking diary, covered in dust and torn from several places. She opened it up, it was from Cpt Mohan Pratap Singh. Her eyes were glued to the name of her husband, written in his own handwriting, she kept admiring the name for next few minutes, and flipped the pages further, to find out his daily stories.The poems he wrote in her love, the little things he noticed about her. How much he loved her and how much he cared for her. As she finished reading the last post, she found a letter crumpled untidily, hidden in the sheets of diary stealthily like a secret message.She took it out, and unfolded it. It wasn’t a familiar hand writing, it was not from her husband. Rather it was a message, which stated:‘I’m a Pakistani soldier, who found this diary lying unclaimed on the land of Pakistan. I didn’t know that I would be so connected to it, by reading a few pages. But I was, and I witnessed Captain Mohan Pratap Singh, when he was taking his last breaths.It would be hard, imagining that someone, you dreamed your entire life with, is no more. But I’m writing this letter to tell you how great your husband was. He loved you and your country more than anything. I saw it in his eyes. Before dying, if he uttered something, it was Roshni, and Jai-Hind. Although you may think of us as traitors and terrorists, but we are also people like you, we also have families. Your husband’s love for you was something, which forced me to parcel back this diary to you. Because you’re the person who needs to know, how lucky you are to have a husband like Captain Mohan.There are martyrs from our side, martyrs from your side, war does no good. There is only destruction all around. I have seen it all, survived it all, but your husband was lucky enough to die for his motherland. Till the end, he kept on pleading us to kill him, but we didn’t. At last, he died with honor.’You can read more stories from my blog here: Short Stories - Mehek Bassi THANKS!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Hi, first of all you really need to calm down, alright? Nothing is wrong, and nothing is destroyed that badly that it can't be fixed! Now, let us try to solve your problems one by one. Okay? First of all, talking about the girl - You love her since past 5 years and she is in a relationship with someone since last 8 months. You know what that means? It means, it's a dead-end now. You really need to move on from here, and focus on your life. She is gone! Forget about her. It is easier said than done, I know, but there's no other choice that you have. You can't go on breaking them up, or you can't force her to be with you when she is already dating someone else! There will be a girl in your life too, and a girl who will ""love"" you as much as you will love her! It's not only about 'loving' someone, it's also about getting back that love in return. I know they preach about being selfless and only about 'giving' in the books and movies, but you know what? That's not true! Nobody can survive in a relationship, if he is just giving, and giving and getting nothing in return. Nobody can be in such a relationship! Not even the writers of the books who preach such stuff!Sadly, there is no other option here, but to move on, and later in life when you find someone who is into you, who is of good-nature, loving and you know she is really fun to hang out with - you can always have a relationship! But right now, forgetting her and moving on, will be the right and the best thing to do.Coming over to your second problem - Your cousin cracked SSB and is going to join NDA - you should be happy for him! It shows how hard he worked, and how focused he was to be cracking a national level exam and going into such a great institute. You shouldn't curse him, because it's HIS hard-work that has paid off! Had you worked hard, had you been focused, you would have been in NDA too right now! But let the bygones be the bygones. You are in 3rd year, right? I am a computer science engineering final year student, so please excuse my limited knowledge about the subject here, but one of my friends did appear in some Air Force exam (I don't know what exam) in final year only and he cracked it too! It is not the end of the world. There are still millions of unexplored possibilities and career options for you to choose from, and if you are focused enough and work hard, you can achieve it too! There's nothing difficult or impossible in this world, and as far as I know, there are thousands of options in Indian Navy and Air Force even after graduation. You can try for it, but you have to be focused.Your cousin has done it - congratulations to him, but it doesn't mean that you put up an undue pressure on yourself for doing something right now! You will also be successful, when your time will arrive, but ONLY IF you are focused and dedicated enough to work for it, and you are not diverted by anything in the world! You want to see your dad happy, right? You want to see your relatives proud of you, isn't it? Then start working - NOW! There's no tomorrow, there's no 'next-week'. What is tomorrow today, will become today tomorrow. So if you really want to start working, stop giving yourself excuses, stop begging for emotional support, stop being a cry-baby, forget that damn-girl, you can always get another if you are well-settled! Just work right now - work work work and don't think about anything else! You are with your friends - enjoy. You are alone - think about your future, career, exams you can give, make a list of the important stuff, plan out your day, plan your schedule well, and just WORK ON IT!If you don't end up anywhere, it will NOT be anyone else's fault but YOURS. You weren't focused, you weren't dedicated, and now you are giving yourself excuses that some girl prevented you from studying - how? By coming into your brains! Ah, come-on! Don't do that! YOU WILL BE HELPLESS and you will have nothing to do but to REGRET. Don't let the regret be your future. Make your future while you can. Work hard and just keep working till you achieve the desired goals. Good luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"First of all is is POSSIBLE! If you want to make it work out, everything is possible. Marie Curie was one great scientist and chemist and one of the smartest women of her time, she married an average guy! However it depends upon the girl - if she's someone who cannot value your love and admiration, and just needs someone of her IQ level then she can never adjust with you, and such girls can never be satisfied because finding a person just like you in a relationship is impossible! You have to make things work, you have to adjust and compromise, you can't imagine to get exactly the package you ordered, it's not online shopping going on! But if the girl is mature and understanding, nothing will matter to her but only love and bonding between you two. Talking about whether it's possible in India? Well if the girl is intelligent and haughty - then no. Don't waste your life marrying such a girl who wants a guy of her IQ so rigidly. You'll end up repenting your entire life. But if she's mature and sensible enough, you can marry her. Ultimately it depends upon person to person. If she's really intelligent, she'll be mature enough to handle a relationship but if she's just having high IQ and ego problem, then you can't call her intelligent. She's a fool for making such demands in the first place. Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"I've no idea about meditation or Yoga because I really refrain myself from these things, but what I do is something different. I learnt it in my gym-cum-aerobics class where we used to do hardcore exercises and strength.Okay, so this might sound easy to do, but it's not so easy -Lie down flat on your stomach on any hard surface (floor would be the best). Place your lower-arms including elbows, on the floor with your fist tightly closed, and slowly rise up just on your toes, without your knees touching the ground. Hold yourself in this position for 25-30 seconds and repeat 5 times. This tightens up your abdominal muscles and improves digestion too, as you can't breathe normally in this position, you have to quickly inhale and exhale to keep the body balanced.NOTE: The stretch in this strength will be in your abdominal area the most! If you're not feeling anything in your abdomen, you are doing it wrong.Here is a picture for understanding -The second thing you can do is - Lie down flat on your stomach and place your hands on the ground, from your fingers to your palm, everything should be touching the ground. Slowly rise up, on your feet - remember - your ""heels"" should touch the floor! Basically the entire foot and entire hand should touch the floor, rest of your body should be balanced on these 4 limbs. Hold yourself in this position for 10-15 seconds and repeat 5 times. This stretches up your entire body, including your spine, abdominal area, thigh-muscles, arm-muscles and especially lower legs. It's the toughest to do (according to me!).Here's an image for understanding:Do these 2 stretches every morning before breakfast, your whole body will open up, and you will feel less fatigue throughout the day. However, initially there will be nasty cramps, but if you continue doing these, they will go away! Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"I am suffering from myopia (short-sightedness) since I was 11-12 I think. My doctor says that watching TV, facing screen has nothing to do with having a weak-eyesight, and I believe he's right! My diet was always good, I was good at sports too, and in 6th grade, I didn't have a computer, neither did I watch too much TV in that time. And now, my number is stable, although 90% of the time I'm awake, I either watch a laptop-screen, or mobile screen or TV-screen, it's all just eye-work! On the other hand, my web-designer friend (who is 28 yrs old now), spent his half life working on and with computers and he has no eye-disease or weakness! His sight is perfectly fine, though he eats so much junk food and indulges in no sport, just sits in one chair 24/7.So I really believe that my doctor was right! Diet or habits don't induce eye-sight weaknesses in 100% of the cases, it's mostly genetic (in DNA). My father, grandfather and grandmother all wear spectacles, and that explains why I and my brother wear them too! Diet and habits are responsible too, but not in all cases.However, you can do the following things to rest and soothe your eyes after a tiring day -Place a finely sliced cucumber piece on each of your eyes for 5 minutes. It cools down your eyes, and relaxes the muscles.Slice a potato finely, and place it on your eyes for 10 minutes before sleeping - it reduces puffiness and dark-circles from around your eyes.Use hydrating eye-drops once a while, as they maintain the hydration level of your eyes, and keep them fresh!Wash your eyes with cold-water every morning right after you wake up. It freshens up the eyes, as well as washes out the gunk from last night's sleep.You can buy any good quality eye-cream (light in texture), and gently massage your eyes and the area around it for 2-4 minutes with your ring-finger (as the pressure induced by the ring finger is the lightest, compared to the other fingers of our hand). That will add moisture and the components in the cream can help your eyes to remain healthy for long.Basically, more than weak-eye sight, it's the look of the eyes that matter! They should not look tired/dull and sick, rather they should look fresh, wide-awake and healthy. Good Luck :)PS: I have tried all 5 remedies listed above and they all worked very well for me. Just that I Wasn't REGULAR maintaining a routine :P I hope they work for you as well. Take care!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Convincing parents is something that every Indian person does at some point of their time because Indian parents are so much into lives of their children that no kid can take any decision independently without having to either fight or break off contacts with his parents. Very rarely parents do understand the child and agree to his wishes, but mostly it's a never-ending struggle.You should convince your parents, and leave no choice before them. You love that girl and you know you will be happy with her. Tell this thing to your parents! Ask them if they can guarantee that the Indian girl they will find for you will be completely honest/loyal about herself? Every other Indian girl has a boyfriend these days, even 15 yr old girls are in relationships, and in arranged marriages, most of the girls are in touch with their boyfriends even after marriage as mostly they are FORCED into it! You don't want a messed up relationship, right? And since you already love someone and she loves you, what's the issue? Tell all this to your parents.Ask them what 'their' problem is. Behave maturely and sensibly. Have a good talk. Ask them the reason of ""why"" they don't want you to marry and ask them what's their issue? If they think that the girl won't be able to understand Indian-traditions or culture? Tell them - that your girlfriend is willing to, and might even learn things, but the arranged-marriage girl that they are going to find, what if she turns out to be ultra-modern chick in future? Will your parents apologize to you then? What if she disrespects your parents? And what's the use of an apology when nothing can be mended once the wedding is done.You need to TALK to your folks, and present STRONG, VALID points. Points they can't ""discard"" or ""deny"" but have to agree to. Points which are so strong that they have no option but to ""consider"" your choice as well, and once they consider it, once they know that that's all you want, they will surely be convinced someday as well! Just don't lose hope. Such cases require hell lot of patience and so much will-power. They will always try to convince you, emotionally, mentally, they will pressure you, they will force you, they will greed you, but it's your choice whether you want to subside and lose in front of them, or want to be firm on your demands and wishes, and ask their blessings to start a new life with your love. Patience and will-power is all it takes, and at the end of it - nothing of it will matter. Remember - your love is MUCH MORE worthy of it than a few years of patience and an undying will-power. At the end, you will also say that all that was totally worth it :)Good luck and Stay Strong!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Well, there are many pros and cons of marriage, and since you need only 'cons', so let me state a few here -You can save hell lot of money and travel the world with that money!No need to spend your life's savings on one function (wedding).You don't need to worry about coming home early! You can come as late as you want.You can have as many friends as you want! If married, you don't get much time to spend socially, and if your spouse is a suspicious one, he won't allow you to have any relationship with a person of opposite sex, but single people, have that advantage!You can always go to parties, host parties at your home, go on night outs, and never have to be worried about a thing!You don't need to worry about kids. There will be no dirty nappies, no crying whole night, no school, no exorbitant college fees, basically you also end up saving a hell lot of money!You can be in as many relationships all your life as you want to. No need to spend your entire life with just one person, you can have a colorful life! You can have a peaceful life. No fights/arguments with your partner, no need to go on a sorry-spree and no need to be worried and smoke a dozen cigarettes in tension of making up with your spouse!No need to pay exorbitant alimony because - no marriage = no divorce!No need to worry about impressing the people you barely know! And it includes all the people who are relatives, friends and even distant relatives of your spouse - well, it's a big relief isn't it?You can have a life of your choice basically - no compromises, no sacrifices, live life on your terms and enjoy to the fullest!!Consider - Matthew Perry (Chandler Bing from F.R.I.E.N.D.S) he never married in real life, neither does he have a baby, he states that he has had the best life so far!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"""In arranged marriage the person is well verified before hand"" how true do you think this statement is?I have over 6 cases in my family which showcase the 'fraud' of arranged marriages -One of my cousins got married to this girl who was really beautiful. After six months of marriage, she took away all the money, and eloped with her lover to China, after telling my maasi that she's going to get some groceries from market!One of my other cousins got married to this guy who was really handsome and extremely rich (mind you, he had a BMW Z4 and a Mercedes S-class for himself!) and that guy was already in a relationship with a 40 yrs old woman, which he revealed after 2 years of marriage!One of my distant cousins got married to a doctor who was well qualified and highly-paid, and he revealed that he got married under family pressure because they wanted a daughter-in-law, but he can't even touch her because he's gay.One of my distant relatives from my mother's side got married 11 years ago to a guy who settled in Italy after a year of marriage, and once in Italy he seized her passport, raped her, had a son with her, threw her out of the home, married an Italian woman, and somehow that relative of mine lived in streets for 3 years before she finally somehow managed to reach India by her own! Her husband was someone who was a known guy in their family, and very well verified person, they were in a relationship for one year before marriage, and he loved her like anything!One of my cousins got married in 2013 to a guy who was earning well and was settled in Mumbai. After 3 years of marriage when my cousin was suspicious of his late-night ventures, he finally revealed to her that he was fond of spending nights with prostitutes in red-light area and can't change his habit! He got married because of family-pressure. Point to be noted: This guy was very well known person, and my cousin's parents had practically seen him grow up in front of their eyes as he was son of my maama-ji's best friend! Talk about verification now!Last and the most horrible one - one of my distant relatives was married to this extremely beautiful woman. He loved her a lot, but there was something strange about her that he noticed after a few years of marriage. She used to go somewhere every Saturday telling him that she's going to a kitty-party with her female friends. He trusted her, she was his wife after all, but one day he asked her that she was going to kitty-parties every Saturday, and never talked about any of her friends or the party after she would come back, why was that so? She didn't answer. Suspicious and confused, one day he followed her, and was shocked to see where she actually was going since almost 3 years now - she drove the car to a river side, where one bearded man in black clothes would come down, and they lit the fire and were indulged in some kind of bizarre activity involving human-skull and red-clothes and weird stuff. She was into ""black-magic""! And she was a very well verified and well known girl!I'm not saying that arranged marriages are all wrong and turn into failures, but the fact that in love marriage - you can know a person better and to the fullest and you have guarantee that he 'loves' you and only you and no-one else and that he won't elope with someone else in future - is something that forms the base of the building of marriage! Many love marriages also result in divorce and separations, but the scope and probability of lies and deceit in arranged marriages is pretty high. Let me tell you what I personally think - nowadays, almost all guys have girlfriends or have 'had' girlfriends in some point of time in their life, right? If tomorrow someone comes to my family for an alliance (arranged marriage), my first question to him would be - in your life of 25-26 years, didn't you impress even ONE SINGLE girl? WHY do you want to do an arranged marriage? These questions will be asked before his name or age or any other thing, and because what has happened in 90% of arranged marriages in my family now, nobody believes in arranged marriages ""these-days"" anymore. It's an era of social media and high-tech technology. You never know what the person is ACTUALLY, and you never know what his past is. The relatives or mutual people who 'claim' that the guy or girl is really good and sophisticated and well behaved, even they don't know what s/he is actually in reality, how many girlfriends/boyfriends they have had in past and whether or not they are loyal in what they say! Whoever wants to get their daughter/son married in an arranged alliance will OBVIOUSLY say that their child is the best person of the world, and even their neighbors and friends won't tell the truth. They will all say that this guy/girl is simply the best, you can't get someone like him/her, blah blah blah, but the real things come out after marriage only.The lies and cheating can also be in love marriage, but since the girl/guy know each other before, and if the affair is long enough (like 6-8 years) then the bonding between them, the love - it is simply unmatched! And you get one life man, what's the big deal in fighting for someone whom you love? If you can't fight for something in life, your life is a trash-can - you are just picking up things you get for free. And if after fight and struggle you get to marry someone who loves you like no-one else, then that fight is totally WORTH IT!Sudha Murthy (wife of Narayan Murthy CEO of Infosys), Gauri Khan (wife of Shah Rukh Khan) - they both had struggles in their marriages. Sudha lent Rs 10'000 to Narayan to start Infosys, and Gauri's parents forcefully married her to Shah Rukh saying that she will repent later on because she was from a well-off family and SRK had nothing at that time. I don't need to tell you where they are today, right? But they both have one thing in common - they both know, that the fight was WORTH IT!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Human emotions are complicated. It's not like we fall in love with only one person and stay there for the rest of our lives. Some do. But some don't. People fall in and out of love all the times. They break others' hearts, they get  their hearts broken by others. It's all common and nothing to worry about.If your partner was dating your 'ex' initially, that can be because of number of reasons -1. His 'ex' was nosy and couldn't let him leave that easy.2. He didn't want to lose you, and he didn't want to hurt his ex also.3. He wanted a smooth breakup without any drama, and a smooth hookup, so he chose to slowly close one relationship while entering into another.4. He wanted you to be there, but he knew that if he would tell you about still dating 'ex', you will leave him, so he chose to hide it. 5. He wanted to breakup with his 'ex', and wanted to show her that there ALREADY was another woman in his life, so he had to deliberately stay in that previous relationship, before there was an actual woman (YOU) in his life, to show it to his 'ex' so that she could let him go!It can be any case. It has happened with some of my friends, many of whom are now happily married too. It's common and it mostly happens because of nauseous relationships and lack of understanding, which was the case with your guy too. You should chill now, as it's a case of past and has nothing to do with your present or future. If you keep going back to past, you can never live in your present and never improve your future!Have a nice relationship with your partner, without bringing things from Medieval Age! :D Have a nice day...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Breakup is the worst feeling in the world!Moving on however, is not as difficult as people think it to be. It's utterly simple. All it needs is - will power and dedication. First - remove all the negativity from your mind against her. Only then you will be able to move on. Tell yourself that - You want to live a happy life BUT you don't want to live a happy life to 'show-her' that you are living a happy life! You get the difference? People think moving on involves showing the other person how happy you are without them, and in this race of showing the person how happy you are, you unintentionally end up being sad/hurt even more than you can imagine - WHY? Because - ONLY YOU want to show the other person how happy you are - the other person isn't interested in knowing that. And when you can't grab their attention, your ultimate motive fails and you end up being even sadder and miserable.So, first of all - remove this thought that you have to do anything to show her - she's gone, she's not there anymore. Whatever you have to do, you've to do it for yourself! To move on, the first thing is - diverting yourself. Diverting is easier than acceptance. Acceptance is something that not everyone can do, it requires a lot of courage and determination. Acceptance requires your belief in the exit of the other person from your life, accepting this fact, being happy ""with"" your memories that you share with them, and subsequently not letting your past affect your present or future! It's not everyone's cup of tea, so let's move on to 'diverting yourself'.To divert yourself - be busy! Make your routine so hectic that you have no time for even the thought of your past. Join gym, join yoga class, join aerobics, join a course you love, do something that you always thought of doing but had no time for. Don't lock yourself in a room for more than one hour. Meet new people, make new friends, be social, party, go out, have fun, watch movies, go shopping, replace your old items with new ones, renew your room, renovate your house, do anything that takes you away from your past! It will take time, but ultimately you will move on.Lastly - be mature, sensible and rational, and you'll be fine! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Indian Parents have this habit of flaunting themselves as the 'ultimate right people'. The decisions taken by them are always FLAWLESS. Their sense of judgement is unquestionable and their chosen family and son-in-law is the most ideal man of the world!I am not supposed to be writing this, BUT I am, because it makes my blood boil - my uncle and aunt (distant), got their daughter (my cousin) married to this guy, who after a few years, turned out to be a douchebag! He cheated on my cousin with his girlfriend, he has a daughter, but he doesn't give a fuck, he never takes his wife on a date, he doesn't take his kid for any vacation, but he himself is always roaming from one city to another! He doesn't let my cousin use any social media account, neither whatsapp! Because of his fear that what he is doing, she might also end up doing the same. All the family knows about it, and they are all SILENT - saying that he's a young guy, he will mend his ways in a few years, and that my cousin is responsible for 'letting her husband slip' out of her hands - THE FUCK!All these reasons make me question everyone that where was your so called perfect sense of judgement when you were getting your daughter married to this man? What were you thinking at the time of marriage? And how can you now shove all the burden of this failed relationship on one woman's shoulders? This is what conservative Indian parents are EXPERT in! If someone tells his parents about his affair - that man/woman becomes the worst prospective groom/bride of the century and the man/woman they find for their kids, is an avatar of Ram and Sita!They do so because - SOCIETY!What will people say? What will relatives say? What will society think? What will President of USA say? Blah Blah Blah!The questions never end, and 2 lives are on stake. They don't think if the guy is good or not, if the family of the guy is accepting or not, they just seek two things majorly -CASTEFINANCIAL SITUATIONIf the guy belongs to their caste and is rich - alliance is fixed! They don't give a fuck about if the guy is a smoker or drinker or if he is a sexual maniac or if he can rape their daughter on the first night. They don't care if the mother-in-law behaves like a bitch the next day of marriage, or if the father-in-law can harass or abuse their daughter too!(These are not just possibilities but INCIDENTS that happened with many girls! Everyday we hear news about burning brides because of dowry, groom demanding cars and cash, sometimes, the mother-in-law is the culprit, and sometimes the father-in-law comes out to be a rapist!)But no. If the caste is same and the guy is earning well, you go to hell! Get married, screw your happiness and dreams, handle your life, handle your husband even if he's a drug addict or is addicted to sex with prostitutes, you HANDLE IT! And if you are not able to handle it - it's YOUR FAULT! Don't come to us crying because - SOCIETY.What will people say? That you left your home? You broke your marriage? Divorce is NOT our culture! We cannot allow you to sit at home. This home doesn't belong to you. You should go back to your in-laws and stay there. Because - SOCIETY - what will neighbor Sharma-ji think?PS: All arranged marriages are NOT the same, but dissatisfaction is on a very higher level now because the world has traveled to 21st Century BUT our customs of choosing a bride/groom are still the 17th Century ones!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Oh yes, they do - but only if they keep their diet good and keep exercising. This question really bothered me when I was young. I used to be a basketball player but stopped if after ninth standard only to focus on board exams in tenth. I also thought that I'll forever be 5'3"" tall and never grow an inch. But surprisingly in 10th & 11th standard, I grew up like 3 more inches and now I'm near 5'6"". I give the credit to diet, my mom made sure I was drinking at least 2 glasses of milk everyday along with dry fruits, other than my three meal diet and I used to walk a lot - a lot!! Sitting at one place or making your body sedentary will stop your growth. And as far as I've noticed in myself and my friends, height has nothing to do with periods but just a good diet and exercise. Girls as young as 12 yrs of age, got their periods but they kept on growing till they were 16-17. In girls, height stops growing relatively earlier than boys. Boys can grow till their early 20s but girls can grow only till 16-17 yrs of age. But I really don't think it has any relation with periods unless you stop exercising or start taking an unhealthy diet.",high,high,high,low,low

No matter how fair she is, if skin color is so important then paint your girl in white and marry her, because nothing is fairer than white-paint!You can marry Girl B, and she will love you unconditionally. She already has crush on you and even proposed to you, so she will always value you and thank you for choosing her. She's not great in academics doesn't mean she's a LOSER in life - remember - Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs - all are college-dropouts. None of them was great in academics! What matters is your intellect and not a three hour exam that decides your future, it's stupid! The entire education system is fucked up, so one should never judge a person on the base of marks and scores. If you want her to do a job, she can get it. Getting a job isn't difficult at all, and working in MNC? It's a joke man! Children scoring 60% in my college are placed in Google, and those scoring 90% are still waiting for other companies and sitting unemployed - talk about mark-sheets now!

I was someone who was afraid from climbing up the stage, I would be the anonymous personality in school, but then one day one of my teachers forcefully put my name in a debate which was to happen in front of entire school. I was in sixth standard then, and I remember crying a lot because of being selected. Here is my childhood picture. I was excellent in academics but low in self-confidence. Always scared and afraid!But then my teacher asked me to write my points on a piece of paper and speak them with confidence everyday in the mirror. I would do that, and the day when I had the big-debate, I wasn't nervous, not even a bit!

How can they guarantee the success of your wedding?

Later in life, like after a decade or so, nobody remembers anybody. At that time if something matters, it's the nature of the person. The relatives and society don't matter.

Mehek-Bassi,"Okay. This is a real incident, happened on 21st April, 2o11. It was my first ever date with my first and only boyfriend, so I am just describing how it went:It was my first date with my boyfriend after exactly 9 days of our commitment. I had just given boards of 12th standard in March, and I was very nervous because it was the first time I was going to hang out with a guy, and that too 'alone' and not in a group. I had no idea what was about to happen (I was just 18!).He was my friend for 2 years before we committed to each other, he is the brother of my childhood-friend, so I trusted him completely and as a couple, it was the first time that we were hanging out together. There are 5 things that I would like to describe about my first date (which is my dream date. I've had over 10 dates with him till now, but that one has been, and will always be the perfect one!)The restaurant that he took me into, was a really good one, but the best thing is - he booked all the tables that afternoon, so that no one could be there that day! No, he is not super-rich, neither am I, but he planned and saved for the date and then blew away the money like a king! He paid the bill, he didn't let me even take out my money!He brought in a driver (it was his friend's chauffeur) who drove us to the venue and who dropped us back as well. He opened the car door for me, he pulled the chair for me in the restaurant and once inside, he gave me a beautiful red-rose! He complimented me about how I looked (though now I realize I looked really horrible that day! I was JUST 18!!)I was very nervous, and he could sense it, so he continually made me laugh. His sense of humor is awesome and one of the main reasons behind - why I asked him out in the first place! So there wasn't a minute of the date that was boring or even normal. It was all awesome. I was laughing, I was giggling and he was enjoying with me.The restaurant had a buffet system, and by the time the main-course ended, we were both so full. We had been eating in separate plates (obviously), but when the dessert arrived (it was a brownie sizzler with vanilla ice-cream), he asked the waiter very politely that we needed only one plate and one spoon to eat! I was shocked at first because we used to share our lunch in school and eat out of each other's lunch-boxes, but this - was the adult version of it! LOL. I was uncomfortable at first, but then it was alright. We ate half the dessert and that too one by one since there was only one spoon. The best thing about entire date was - there was NO ONE in the entire restaurant to see us or judge us, so we were very free and that is the best thing that he (or any man) can do to make his girlfriend comfortable!At the end of the date, his driver drove us back till my car, and he walked out of the car to open the door for me. He then opened the door of my car for me (yes he was so sweet that day!), and he kissed me on the back of my hand (YES HAND!). He never kissed my face, forehead, cheek or lips till he knew that I wanted it or was okay with it. He never rushed into things and has always been really patient with everything.We are still dating each other! We are into 5th year of our relationship and in long-distance, and we meet only once in a year, but the love keeps us going! The first-date was the only one that has been so sweet, after that he never even said I looked good, let alone opening doors of cars and restaurants for me! Now he says all that was stupid, and that he was just a 12th pass boy who was really excited to have made first girlfriend of his life...LOL! But whatever the case maybe, I loved him that day! And I know that I continued the relationship majorly because of that first-date...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Best Sellers are not usually the 'best written' books. In the Indian bestseller section you can find even some horribly written books with no story at all! I could state some of them here, but I don't want to start a fight, as that is my personal opinion :PIn India, a book is a bestseller if it sells 15-20 thousand copies. And Chetan Bhagat is someone who can be called an initiator of Modern Indian Literary Market. His books were the first attempt on modern day society, sarcasm on our education system (Five Point Someone) and a slap on the face of those who say Love marriages end up into divorces (2 States). When he came, there was no other competitor, so basically the ground was clean for him, and he made the most out of it. After his success, youth blindly started following him, and started writing books! 50 thousand words is nothing to write especially when it comes to an engineering student who has to write assignments and presentations worth a lot more! Publishing houses thought that just like Rupa (Chetan Bhagat's publishers), they can also mint money by launching some Indian lad from IIT with an ordinary story.The result of this boom was - SPLASH! A downfall for Indian Literature as thousands of publishing houses emerged with lacs of authors waiting to be published. The houses would just print 10'000 copies and declare the book to be a bestseller - 'whoa'! And the author would think his book did really well, which was NOT the case since the criteria of a bestseller in India is marked only by numbers and not by reader-reviews.The readers gave a chance to hundreds of new authors, but most of them were inspired by Chetan Bhagat, hell some were even copying stuff from his books blatantly! Their writing styles matched so much, that readers went back to square one, reading Bhagat books all over again, for at least, he was 'original' if nothing else!So this is how, Chetan Bhagat books sell well!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"First of all - CALM DOWN!No, it's not a sin loving someone of a different caste, and it's not a sin to love a girl at all! I can imagine the situation at your place, and I can understand how tough it would be for you to handle it all alone, with no one by your side, but I really want to congratulate you first of all - had it been a girl instead of you, she would have been scared as hell and agreed to marry a guy of her caste, which is what mostly girls do, but kudos - you are still holding on to your love and trying to make things right.I would suggest you to calmly have a discussion with your parents. You certainly need to convince them if you want to marry peacefully! There is no other way your parents can be convinced other than a logical discussion. Your family (as you mentioned, they hail from a village) is conservative and narrow minded, so they will all try to manipulate your parents into forcing you to leave that girl and marry someone else. But in all this, they are not losing anything, you will be losing - not only the love of your life, but also a girl whom you know and trust! How can you trust someone from your caste so easily? How can you say that the girl that your parents arranged - would be as smart and loving as your girlfriend, or she will be loyal or she is not having a boyfriend currently? (In one of the cases that happened in my family, the girl was committed to her guy, and yet she married for the sake of her parents and continued her relationship. After marriage the husband freaked out and divorced her, and in another 2 months, she married her boyfriend! But the person who suffered the most was the same-caste husband!)Coming back to the point, you need to have a logical and practical discussion with your parents. Tell them the following points -Since it's my life, I want to decide what kind of girl I want to spend it with. I don't mind spending my entire life with a girl you guys find, but marriage is something that happens once in life, and what if we are not compatible? How can you guarantee that I will be happy with a girl of our caste just because she belongs to our caste? And what if I am not happy? Who will apologize then? My life would be spoiled forever, will you then allow me to leave her, and get a divorce?Since I am in love with another girl, so I will never be able to STOP comparing my girlfriend with any girl that you find for me. It would be almost impossible for me to move on, and accept someone as my wife, when every time I imagined my girlfriend to be my wife!How can you say that the girl I have found for myself is bad or wrong? Have you met her? Have you tried to live with her? I want that whoever should be my wife, should not only love me, but respect YOU both as well, and I know my girlfriend will do that, but I am not sure about the girl you will find, and if she fails to respect you or picks fights with mom, or does anything that hurts you, I will leave her right there and then, and then even you can't complain because you were the ones who forced me into all this! Will you support me to get a divorce then?The girl that I am in love with - isn't she someone's daughter? How can you be so inhuman and ask me to breakup with her just because she's not from our caste? Think about her as well for once! What will happen to her if I say that I am going to leave her, and that she has to marry someone else, when she always dreamed about me as her husband? How can you be so ruthless? (Be Emotional! Emotional always works!)I have always had certain expectations from my life, and I have always wanted to see certain qualities in my wife, and now I have found a girl with all the qualities that I ever desired about. If you ask me to get married to a same-caste girl, can you guarantee that she has all those qualities that my girlfriend has? (List down some of the best things about your girlfriend, like her qualification, her smartness, intelligence, her multi-tasking, it can be anything...)I cannot hide this thing from my wife that I love someone else, can you help me find a girl who will accept me for being who I am? Who will have no problem with her husband loving some other girl even after marriage? I can't leave my girlfriend, because it's NOT her mistake that she wasn't born in our caste! It's no reason to leave a person! I will always be in touch with her, ALWAYS. Now if there is any same-caste girl that would love to have a husband having an extra-marital affair, I think I am ready to get married to her!I am sure your parents will listen to some of these, if not all, and will understand your and your GF's situation too. I hope things get well soon and I really, really wish that you and your love, end up together!! Please post marriage photos, once that happens :) And don't lose hope, anything is possible in this world! Just be positive, keep trying, and one day your parents will definitely welcome your love with open arms...",high,high,high,low,low

You will start saving those 2K for your own, to get a house, car, to get all those things that your friends own, because in 10 years, they have Side-lined you because you are financially NOT UP TO the mark! And it HAPPENS. Socially, we become handicapped if we are not financially up to the mark. And all the people want to be friends with rich people (it sounds cheap, but it's the TRUTH of the world and we can't change it!). So after becoming rich again, you join your friends-circle and you get socially active. But what about the underprivileged people now? Ah, nobody cares about them - BECAUSE - you cared enough, and you saw all your friends/relatives/cousins marching ahead of you, and you were ignored socially! Nobody can live alone. We all need a social circle, a friends-group, a family to be with. And no matter what we want to do in life, our decisions are subconsciously HIGHLY driven by the society we live in. So even if one person wants to help the world, the 100 others around him will pull him down eventually, knowingly or unknowingly, but they will :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"The use of hello as a telephone greeting has been credited to Thomas Edison. According to one source, he expressed his surprise with a misheard Hullo. Alexander Graham Bell initially used Ahoy (as used on ships) as a telephone greeting. However, in 1877, Edison wrote to T.B.A. David, the president of the Central District and Printing Telegraph Company of Pittsburgh:Friend David, I do not think we shall need a call bell as Hello! can be heard 10 to 20 feet away.What you think? Edison - P.S. first cost of sender & receiver to manufacture is only $7.00.By 1889, central telephone exchange operators were known as 'hello-girls' due to the association between the greeting and the telephone.SOURCE: Wikipedia.HOWEVER, there exists an alternate story as well:It states that there was a girl called Margaret Hello and she was supposed to be the girlfriend of Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of telephone. And from her name the word originated. It goes on to add that in life we may forget the name of the great inventor Graham Bell but never that of his girlfriend, who was his true love. However, the fact is that Graham Bell never had a girlfriend name Margaret Hello; he had a wife whose name was Mable Hubbard Bell. And the sad irony was she could never be able to use a phone because she was deaf. Also in reality, the word used by Bell afterinventing the telephone was Ahoy! It was actually Thomas Alva Edison who first used the word ‘Hello’ on mistakenly hearing a ‘Hullo.’ One finds the word ""Hello"" as an acceptable form of greeting between people of all levels and strata of society, whether it be your closest friend or the President of the United States or Queen of England or any ordinary person.SOURCE: Why Say 'hello' On Lifting The Telephone?",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"First of all, you should just focus on your job right now, and on the base of your job, you can have plenty of on-site opportunities from your MNC only. Inquire about it, every multinational company sends it's employees abroad someday or the other, based upon your performance and your own preference. My cousin went to US through his job only, as doing MS meant not only wasting 2 years, but also leaving job and starting studying again which is very tough once you lose that habit or regular study, doing assignments and projects etc after college. You can support your family right now, and instead of taking loan and going abroad to study, just grab any on-site opportunity. Once abroad, you can even make a switch from your company to any other company which is based in US, and subsequently you will end up in US with not only a good-payscale but also an awesome level of job-experience (since you won't have to drop out to study further).Rest the choice is always yours :) Always think about all the pros and cons before coming to a particular decision.

Mehek-Bassi,"Living Happily, and needing a partner to do that are two different things. You can be happy with yourself too! And rather much happier, than you can be with any person, let me tell you how -You can't break your own expectations, while other person might break your expectations which can lead to misery and sadness!You can't wait for your own self and regret! It's impossible! While other person, might make you wait or even cancel the lunch/dinner date - leading to fights and arguments. It's rather better to enjoy your own company (Been there, done that!). I've been to many restaurants alone and had lunch. It feels terrific!!! Try it!You can watch as many movies as you want! You don't have to ask the other person all the time, if he likes a certain movie and if he will be able to accompany you. I've seen like 20 movies alone, including The Fault in Our Stars, Badlapur, The Interstellar, Gravity etc, and I thoroughly enjoyed the movies!You don't need to ask permissions for hanging out with opposite sex! Being in a relationship restricts you from this freedom. You can hang out with as many girls (if you are a boy) and as many boys (if you are a girl), without having to worry about what your boyfriend/girlfriend will say about it!I'm not saying having partner is a BAD thing, but BEFORE you bring another person in your life, you should be happy with yourself. If you are not happy, how can you keep the other person happy? :) And the concept of happiness has nothing to do with having a partner or not. You can enjoy as much (even more) as you want to, being single!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Patience, and a lot of patience!What one lacks in a long distance relationship, the most is - patience. We want the time to pass by as quickly as possible so that we can be with our partner as soon as possible, but time will pass at it's own pace, and it's 'us' who have to be patient!Apart from patience, you also need the following things -Loyalty - Be loyal to your partner, if you expect the same in return.Transparency - Once you are in a long distance relationship, you need to be transparent with your partner about everything, every little detail, every little thing going on in your life. Alternate Communication Options - Don't have much time to talk on phone or have a time difference? Start writing-letters/e-mails/text/voice-messages to each other, explaining how much you miss him/her or what new things are happening in your life. Always consider your partner to be an integral part of your life, what happens in both of your lives, is something that has to be shared, to remain close and in love!Never Miss The Opportunity to say ""I Love You"" - There is going to be very limited communication, you can't see each other that often, so what remains is your phone talks, or your chats, or messages. NEVER miss out any opportunity to say ""I Love You."" It does nothing, but will remind the other person that there's someone in the other corner of the world, waiting for him/her...Lastly, be honest and truthful if you want your relationship to work. Never lie or hide things, it will become a problem in future. Love each other, as love conquers all the problems!Source: Myself!

Mehek-Bassi,"Since you have revealed that her parents are possessive and narrow minded, are you sure they will accept this relationship? Before telling them anything, think about what consequences can it bring! Will they allow her to lead a normal life? Don't get me wrong, but I witnessed one of the cases in my neighborhood, where the parents found out about the girl's affair, and they stopped her from attending college, going out, and every other normal-life activity. She was locked in her home, her phone was snatched, everything came to a halt for her. Her entire life changed since the day she revealed about her relationship, and only parents with extremely narrow mentality and possessive mind can do that!Revealing about relationship is one thing, but in India, parents sometimes don't accept, or even want to listen about it. Some parents can even take some extreme steps like getting their girl married to someone else, as soon as possible, once they know that she's in a relationship with someone!Opening up is one thing, but you should be aware of the consequences as well. If you think her parents will act sensibly and will accept it, then go ahead, but if there's even a slight chance, don't risk your lives! This one decision can cost you a lot, as I've seen in my neighborhood. It became hell for the girl and the relationship was forcefully broken off, and she was married away secretly to a guy of her parents' choice, moreover, the guy (boyfriend) never got to see her after that day! If the mother of your girlfriend is asking about her phone being busy all the time, just ask your girl to lie - say anything, but cover things up, and NOT let her parents suspect about what's going on, if they don't understand these things. You stop talking to her for a few days, and let her pretend that everything is alright at her end.

Do you mean 'sexual'? If yes, then let me tell you - everyone is here because of 'sex', and even you (SURPRISE!!).I tell you how I use whatsapp:I discuss only official college stuff with my friends on whatsapp, I don't have time to chat otherwise, I don't even reply to 90% of the 'hi', 'hellos' or anything that I know isn't important. So for me - it is the best thing ever! I can't imagine my life without whatsapp! I have studied in exams, ONLY on and because of whatsapp! So, if whatsapp wasn't there, I wouldn't pass my exams!If YOU-CHOOSE To use whatsapp for ""dirty"" things, it's YOUR fault! Don't blame it upon the application, because the owner of whatsapp is NOT asking you to spread filth there! It's the most-used chatting website and it really helps connect people all over the world! The purpose of making whatsapp was GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY! Today you blame whatsapp, tomorrow facebook, and then what - internet? Are you suggesting that we move back into the 1990s and then to 60s and then finally to pre-independence era where Indians used to clean toilets of British?

Mehek-Bassi,"There are 5 things that if my university (I am in an engineering college, SO my answer is based upon what we get taught in Indian Engineering Colleges) taught me, I would be forever grateful to them -All About Share Market, Investment, Equity, Mutual Fund, Shares etc - Being a student of engineering branch, we never got introduced to such things which are a vital part of our economy and lives. It's something that I learnt partially from my commerce friends, and partially from my family!About how people can be ungrateful assholes and ditch you - Universities, schools, they all tell you to be tolerant and help people as much as you can, but what they never tell you is that how some people can be ungrateful towards your help and can ditch you, screw you over, dump you, break your heart and how to GET OVER them in life! I've seen many kids commit suicide because of breakup in their relationship or friendship or because they were bullied or left alone by their friends. Universities should take counseling sessions of all kids where they should teach everyone about this unfaithful community of humans, and how to get over them if you encounter one in your life!About how should you plan and save your income, and invest it in a better way - No doubt, engineering jobs are high paying, but what to do once you start earning - is something no engineering college teaches us! Many kids (not all certainly) blow up their first year's salary because they didn't plan anything, they couldn't manage it, they were unsure about how things happened! Engineering colleges should also have a class about managing finances and income, and savings and investments!Alternate Career Options - In engineering colleges we get campus-placements in all sectors, ranging from Computer Engineering to Mechanical to Civil for the respective branches, but what if a student wants to be a writer? What if he wants to be a singer? It's not that if he has done engineering, he MUST get an engineering job only! There are kids who do engineering because of many reasons and parental pressure being one of them, but then later in life they aren't satisfied with their career. In final year of college, there should be a counseling about alternate career options and how to pursue them!Happily Accepting Failure - This is something that NO university in this country teaches you! Teachers will threaten you to pass otherwise your life will be over. Your fellow classmates will threaten you by 3G - (grabbing good grades). Your parents will threaten you that if you don't pass, they will pull you out of college and get you married (especially girls!). Ultimately, what no one teaches you is HOW TO ACCEPT FAILURE. What if you FAIL? It's not the end of the earth! Kids commit suicide because of getting 'less' marks in boards or university exams, which shows how much fear we have instilled in them! They can't cope with failure, they can't take it up and learn from their mistakes! While in WEST, we don't have this sheep-herd culture. Kids are exploring new things, they are starting start-up companies, and failing and rising again, and if they fail, they don't die! While here, if you fail, your relatives, your parents, the society - everyone will make sure that you DIE!

Mehek-Bassi,"Sometimes we need a closure!I would suggest you to stay busy, but since you already are and it's not helping you, I would advice you to call him. Talk to him once, and talk very generally! Don't tell him that you miss him or something. Just know about him, what he's doing, how is he, and if there's any other girl in his life. Knowing about how he has moved on, can give you a closure. There's no guarantee though. In such cases (of breakup I mean), there is no guarantee when a person will move on. It all depends upon your self-control and will-power. You can take one month to move on, or one year, or even ten years, but always remember, whenever you decide that you have to move on, you will have to start from scratch. And when you have to start from scratch, why waste ten years or one year or even six months for it? Why not start from right now?And if you will not move on, how will you be able to make yourself happy again? You can't remain in this misery and despair. You need some happiness in your life! And you never know if someone might love you more than your 'ex'?

Mehek-Bassi,"When a parent passes away, it's a very hard time for the children, especially when the child is of young age, and if your boyfriend is in his 20s or younger, it's gonna hit him really hard!Well, you can always be supportive emotionally, he needs you and he needs your support. He needs a shoulder to cry on. Don't ask him not to cry, rather provide your shoulder when he needs one. Talk to him about everything, about the good times spent with his mother! This is something that people don't do, fearing that it will make the person cry more, but rather it helps them remember the good times they spent with the person who is dead now, and they are able to provide a final-closure to themselves through it. Talk to him about his relationship with his mother, and how she got cancer. He will himself describe her situation in her final days, and will later on himself realize that she was in such a severe pain that death is much better than life in such cases! He might breakdown several times, but you need to calm him down, tell him that you are here for him any time, any second he needs you. If you can't meet him everyday, tell him that you are just a call away. No matter what happens, always attend his calls and don't IGNORE him, at least not for a week or ten-days after her death. He might pretend to be strong to avoid crying in front of you, but don't let him do that. It causes depression and anxiety. Rather tell him, that you are his best friend, and he has nothing to be shy about from you. Let him cry openly and freely, without thinking that someone might be judging him on the other side of the call. Extend him a helping hand whenever he needs it, may it be in the middle of the night! Don't run away if he's crying, rather comfort him, and tell him that his mother is in a better place now. Once a few days have passed, and you think he is getting normal - then STOP discussing about his mother, stop bringing her in every conversation, rather divert the topic so that he can be normal and move on from this big loss. If he talks about his mother himself, and wants to share some happy memories, do talk, do listen, but don't say anything that makes him cry! Rather be happy that he had a wonderful relationship with his mother. Take him to dates and movies once a month or two have passed, so that he comes out of the black-hole of his life, and can be normal. Talk to him about his career, about your relationship, about anything, but his mother! It's not that he will forget her, no child can forget his parent, no matter what, but diverting will help him curb his despair and misery, and he will be himself once again, but if you keep talking about his mother, he will be pushed into depression, further away!You are his ultimate support - remember that! Guys usually don't show their emotional side to everyone, but only a few people who mean something to them, and a girlfriend/wife comes in those few people. There will be many of his friends/relatives, family members who will cry even after months of the death, his relatives will regularly ask him about how he's doing, and how his life is without his mother - you have to handle him in such cases. They will talk about his mother even long after her death, you have to divert his mind, and make him move on from it slowly and gradually and make him accept this hard fact of life. Dealing with death can be devastating, but it can be done if there's someone to support you!I hope things go fine. Take care and good luck.",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"India is a country full of politics, corruption and crime. Doesn't matter if the IAS himself is good guy, or even God, he can't survive with honesty. When there is a pressure from up-above (politicians), he has to obey or he gets transferred, thrown out of service, threatened, killed, his wife and kids are threatened, and there's a lot more ugliness involved. And if he obliges, he becomes a part of crime, a part of all the unfair deals and filth. I have no idea about the future, but this is the current scenario, and how can I say that? Well, a neighbour of mine got recruited in civil services and has suffered a lot, gets verbally abused from the local MLAs or MPs for doing his work with honesty and even got transferred twice in six months, which is seriously annoying I believe.If I am given a chance to marry an average-earning middle class man, versus a high-ranking officer, possessing an access to the 'red-beacon', an army of servants around, corruption and bribery, I would happily choose - the average earning middle class man. At least I won't be his partner in crime!Apart from that, marriage isn't determined by one, two or even ten factors. There are 'n' number of factors that are important and that work behind successful marriage. First one is - your bonding, second - your understanding and will to compromise and sacrifice for each other, third - your understanding of his family as your own, and his understanding of your family as his own, fourth - the unconditional love, being good to each other, understanding each other's needs without having to speak them out loud, etc etc etc! So, there are thousands of things that matter at the end, and when it comes to breaking apart, only one reason is sufficient. Personally, I will vote against marrying some politician or civil servant, because 'personally' I don't like this field despite the class, reputation and money involved in it.

Mehek-Bassi,"Average height of Indian guys is 5'5"" so you are fairly above that. I won't call you short, but you are not tall either. And it's not like you can't date girls who are 5'3"" or 5'4"". It's all about the relationship you have with that person, and not about height or your appearance or skin color or anything that you think might matter! Ultimately in a relationship, nothing matters, but only love and understanding. I am 5'6"" (168 cm) and my guy is 6'1"" (186 cm) so basically we have very much difference in our heights, but I love it because I love wearing heels and around my guy I can wear as many high-heels as I wish to! But on the contrary, one of my friends (female) is 5'9"" and her partner is 5'10"". If you look at them standing bare-foot on the ground, you will feel the girl is taller than the guy even though it is the other way round. Biologically girls LOOK taller than guys because of our curvy figures. Guys on the other hand are more straight and you can say - rigid, so they look comparatively shorter. So, girls generally prefer to date guys who are much taller than them, so that they are free to wear high-heels (in my opinion!), but there are many couples who do not follow the societal norms. Girls are taller than guys, sometimes even equal to. Ultimately, it's all about the love and understanding :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Okay. This is a real incident, happened on 21st April, 2o11. My dream date has already taken place, so I am just describing how it went:It was my first date with my boyfriend after exactly 9 days of our commitment. I had just given boards of 12th standard in March, and I was very nervous because it was the first time I was going to hang out with a guy, and that too 'alone' and not in a group. I had no idea what was about to happen (I was just 18!).He was my friend for 2 years before we committed to each other, he is the brother of my childhood-friend, so I trusted him completely and as a couple, it was the first time that we were hanging out together. There are 5 things that I would like to describe about my first date (which is my dream date. I've had over 10 dates with him till now, but that one has been, and will always be the perfect one!)The restaurant that he took me into, was a really good one, but the best thing is - he booked all the tables that afternoon, so that no one could be there that day! No, he is not super-rich, neither am I, but he planned and saved for the date and then blew away the money like a king! He paid the bill, he didn't let me even take out my money!He brought in a driver (it was his friend's chauffeur) who drove us to the venue and who dropped us back as well. He opened the car door for me, he pulled the chair for me in the restaurant and once inside, he gave me a beautiful red-rose! He complimented me about how I looked (though now I realize I looked really horrible that day! I was JUST 18!!)I was very nervous, and he could sense it, so he continually made me laugh. His sense of humor is awesome and one of the main reasons behind - why I asked him out in the first place! So there wasn't a minute of the date that was boring or even normal. It was all awesome. I was laughing, I was giggling and he was enjoying with me.The restaurant had a buffet system, and by the time the main-course ended, we were both so full. We had been eating in separate plates (obviously), but when the dessert arrived (it was a brownie sizzler with vanilla ice-cream), he asked the waiter very politely that we needed only one plate and one spoon to eat! I was shocked at first because we used to share our lunch in school and eat out of each other's lunch-boxes, but this - was the adult version of it! LOL. I was uncomfortable at first, but then it was alright. We ate half the dessert and that too one by one since there was only one spoon. The best thing about entire date was - there was NO ONE in the entire restaurant to see us or judge us, so we were very free and that is the best thing that he (or any man) can do to make his girlfriend comfortable!At the end of the date, his driver drove us back till my car, and he walked out of the car to open the door for me. He then opened the door of my car for me (yes he was so sweet that day!), and he kissed me on the back of my hand (YES HAND!). He never kissed my face, forehead, cheek or lips till he knew that I wanted it or was okay with it. He never rushed into things and has always been really patient with everything.We are still dating each other! We are into 5th year of our relationship and in long-distance, and we meet only once in a year, but the love keeps us going! The first-date was the only one that has been so sweet, after that he never even said I looked good, let alone opening doors of cars and restaurants for me! Now he says all that was stupid, and that he was just a 12th pass boy who was really excited to have made first girlfriend of his life...LOL! But whatever the case maybe, I loved him that day! And I know that I continued the relationship majorly because of that first-date...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Well, the answer to ""WHY"" you felt bad is pretty understood - because you were his girlfriend 'once'!It happens to all of us. It's very natural. You would have felt bad EVEN IF you yourself were married and had kids, and you got to know about his girlfriend. It's basic human instinct. When we possess something or consider something to be 'ours', somewhere in deep corners of our mind, we still have that thought of possession, though we consciously 'know' and 'accept' that the thing is NOT ours anymore, still it's possession by someone else will hurt us! It happens not only with 'humans' or 'people', but also with 'things' like when we have to give up our favorite toy to our younger sibling, we still miss it, although we know it's not our age to possess it anymore. Like I still miss my barbie dolls that I had to give to my neice last month, though I am fully aware that at 22, nobody plays with Barbie Dolls anymore! It's a kind of socio-emotional attachment, that gives us the feeling of partition and ultimately 'pain'.Don't think you love him or anything, because it's not the case. You should rather try to be happy as he's moving on with his life! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"The answer here is - Sub-Conscious mind!Your subconscious mind is 30-thousand times more powerful than your conscious mind. Whatever you have felt, stays in your conscious mind, like the sensation of heat or cold, sensation of holding a cube of ice in your hand for too long, all that is stored in your conscious mind, but your sub-conscious mind brings up those scenarios which you have never experienced in your life - like having sex with someone! You don't know how it feels, yet you thought you felt it because - Subconscious mind - it's powerful enough to make you feel things that you've never experienced in life. It releases adrenaline in your body and you feel like everything's happening for real!Some people can even control their subconscious mind and produce dreams they want to see. The concept is called 'Lucid Dreaming'. Google it, you will find a lot of interesting information regarding it! I once had a dream of walking down a dark lane, and someone following me. I woke up at 04 with sweat on my face and a fast beating heart. I know I've never experienced this in real life, yet I felt like someone was actually following me in a dark lane, and that is what caused the adrenaline rush in my system and I felt as if it's happening for real.

Mehek-Bassi,"Before hitting the streets - GET A JOB!Even if it is a little humiliating to stay at your uncle's, stay till you get a job, and once you have a job and some money, give some money out of it to your uncle as a token of thanks for letting him stay at his place. And your father's place? Don't go there - EVER! It's not the right kind of environment to be in. You are too young right now, just 20. You can hunt for some part time job and start paying back your uncle little by little, and ask him to allow you to stay with him till you get a full time job and you are financially stable. I'm sure he won't deny. Your story reminds me of the movie - Udaan! At the end, even that guy left his father's home and traveled alone with his little brother, but that was a movie. Don't think of doing that unless you have some other place to stay. Living on streets is miserable and you will have a thousands of problems in your graduation as well. So, my advice would be - join some part-time job, just come home to sleep that's all, that way you won't have to face your relatives much! Once you have a job, you can arrange your food and you can be busy the entire day in your college plus job, and you can also pay a little to your uncle for his generosity. Once you are settled on your own, you can manage things independently.Good Luck. I hope you find a good job, and don't have to move out on streets. God bless you...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Well, congratulations for being the head-boy of school! :) You can introduce some new changes like - Every morning after the prayer or school assembly or whatever routine your school follows in the morning - you can have a thought-reading session, where one student of one particular class recites a good-thought about discipline and self-control and being punctual etc etc. There are thousands of topics about the thoughts! You can have a rotation among the classes, and every morning, one student of any random class (representing that class) should recite the thought. It will take hardly 30 seconds to recite a thought, but a positive thought every morning can bring a vast change to every student's day and life!You can suggest your school principle that there should be a break other than lunch break. Maybe a 10-15 minutes break when the schedule is too tight so that kids can freshen themselves up and go back to study more attentively.You can ask your dance/music teachers to add a patriotic musical or dance item in your annual day function, and make the kids understand oneness and patriotism by seeing above religion and caste and creed and every other difference we have among each other :)You can introduce a speech/debate/declamation or extempore contest on independence or republic day, on various topics that not only enlighten students about history of the country but also introduce them to new facts about India, that they are unaware of!You can also do some reforms in school routine, like asking the teachers to add a little exercise for kids on one day of the week where they have to bring a new fact or a new invention or something new happening in the world, or a new technology introduced that month or that week. basically make the kids up-to-date about what's happening in the world!That would be enough I think :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Alright. Well, you are not missing anything - first of all. You are rather in a peaceful space my friend. The day you start interacting with females, you will find that the world has turned upside down! I being a female, can easily say that more than 50% of my sisters on this planet, care too much about makeup, shopping, spending money, finding a rich guy, not working but willing to get married to someone with a huge amount of money, and that all is really sick. It drives me crazy too, but I am glad I do not belong to that part of the community. However the other half is sane. Some girls do think about career and making a future, earning themselves, being independent and obviously NOT being a gold-digger and settling for someone who genuinely loves them, and just not someone with overflowing bank-balance. If you want to interact with girls, do not start with sports, almost 90% of us hate it. We are not fans of cricket or football, and we hate when guys shout when Dhoni hits a six out of the field (not funny!). We don't like video games either (90% of us don't, if Candy Crush is NOT counted). We also don't like to talk about cars or bikes. We don't know what is top-speed or stunts like wheelie or the other weird things guys talk about. You want to talk to girls? Hit a conversation by asking her 'how is she and how has her day so far been'. Believe me, you can talk to a girl for more than 1 hour on that, because she has the capacity to explain it to you with all the details of the day and what she did, instead of saying ""I'm fine"".Keeping the humor aside, girls are a lot like men. They talk about shopping (Guys version of: cricket/football), they talk about new beauty regimes like new manicures or pedicures they got (Guys version of: the latest games launched in the market), they can also discuss which bollywood actor they want to marry (Guys version of: Which actress they want to...well...alright)Coming to the point here (I guess I already explained too much), girls can be easily talked to. Just be polite with them, don't use abusive words (we pretend to hate it, although we use it with our friends all the time), don't be rude to people around you and don't be too nerdy. Girls don't like men who talk about politics or science all the time (you can talk, but in limit. Once we have said we don't care who is contesting USA presidential elections next year? It's OVER).Thank you for your time! Cheers :DPS: No girls were harmed in writing this! I mean it. Seriously. Okay Bye.",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Once my boyfriend forgot my birthday (Yes, I consider it as a small mistake, a very small rather, because I'm not a typical girl who would kill her guy for forgetting just another day in the year! Doesn't matter much.)But coming to the question -I am in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend, so we have never celebrated any birthday/anniversary etc together, in past 5 years! My birthday comes in December, so it's always the exam-time, so it's impossible for him to visit my city, and it is impossible for me to go to his city as well. It was December 2013, and he forgot my birthday entirely. He had an exam that day, and so he was preparing the entire previous night. I don't blame him, because it can happen with anyone! The next day in exam, he might have written 'date' on the paper, and then he might have remembered that it is my birthday today! But he couldn't do anything about it, because he was in the exam-center!So as the exam ended, he immediately rushed out, and the first thing he did was call me up, wish me and apologize like a hundred times! I was laughing inside, but I pretended as if I was really angry at him. He kept saying sorry, but I simply said 'it's okay'. He felt guilty about it and requested me to ask him whatever today, make any wish and he will fulfill it! I asked him to stop being so desperate, but he said that he won't let this matter go, unless I allowed him to compensate!I asked him something bizarre. He didn't expect it, and before asking, even I didn't expect it! I asked him to visit me on 'Valentine's Day' after 2 months. We had never celebrated Valentine's together, so I really wanted to go out with him for a lunch or something that day. I would see my friends hanging out with their boyfriends and I would really feel bad. He agreed, but I was sure that he would forget that too.But the next year - February 2014:He not only celebrated Valentine's Day with me in my city, BUT the entire Valentine's Week to compensate for forgetting my birthday 2 months ago!1. He sent me a bouquet of roses via a mutual friend on Rose Day.2. He proposed to me to be his best-friend 'before' being his girlfriend, and I said 'yes' LOL!3. He sent me lots and lots of chocolates on Chocolate Day. 4. He sent me a big parcel having a Teddy on Teddy Day. 5. He made a promise to never FORGET my birthday ever again. And he celebrated the entire Valentine's Week BEFORE he himself finally came on the Valentine's Day on 14th, and took me on a very romantic lunch date!Here's a picture of the teddy (it's a bunny actually) and the chocolates:PS: We celebrated the hug day and kiss day on Valentine's itself! :P",high,high,high,low,low

There are no tensions or worries, you don't have to impress anyone, you don't feel inferior to anyone anymore, you don't have any competitor to screw your happiness, you don't have any goals or missions anymore, you're free, finally and you can finally rest, away from everyone, your parents, your children, your loved ones, who will miss you like crazy, the people who cared for you, the people for whom you are a role model, everyone will miss you and some will learn from you too, some will follow your steps and if you're going on a suicide mission, remember that there are people who look up to you and people who expect from you, you're being a coward and running away, they'll follow your footsteps someday, do you want that to happen? If this is a general question then that's all what death may feel like, although I'm alive right now, but my life is peaceful and no less than death, that's because I've kept unnecessary burdens at bay. I've distanced myself from all the tensions and worries and competition and everything. In the end, I am satisfied...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Your answer is NOT in exercise or even diet or routine-change, but in doing something that calms your mind, and that is - Meditation.No, I'm not talking about hardcore meditation, like the professionals do, but some simple steps that you can take after exercising everyday. Once you finish your exercise routine, set a stop-watch for 5 minutes on your phone, put your phone in airplane mode so no call or message interrupts you, sit on the floor with your legs crossed, back straight and upright, and close your eyes. In those 5 minutes, try to focus your mind. Don't think about work or yourself or office, or even the 'timer' on stop-watch. It's hard to achieve the first time, but if you will do it for a few days regularly, you will achieve it. Focus your mind to 'nothingness'. Let me tell you what I do when I can't sleep at night due to multiple thoughts running -I close my eyes, sit with legs crossed, back upright, and I imagine space. Imagine planets and dark, black space. Watch some movies like Gravity or Interstellar to experience the calm and peace of space. It might sound stupid to people, but it is what works the BEST for me! Focus on moving planets, black sky, stars in the distance, imagine you are above the Earth and try to see it from outer-space, our blue green planet, see the moon, walk past Mars, reach other galaxies, and you won't even know when the five minutes will end and you will be back! I do it at night because I listen to ASMR after that, which puts me to sleep in 3-5 minutes. Now what is ASMR? It's - Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. It is a tingling feeling that you feel at the back of your neck or in your spine when in childhood, your friends used to draw stuff on your back! Or when the you got a relaxing head-massage in a salon. You felt good, isn't it? That is ASMR. It's best experienced by wearing earphones that you can wear to sleep. I just play some ASMR videos on YouTube and lay down, keep the phone aside, and focus more on 'listening' than watching. Within a minute or two, I am feeling drowsy and within 3-5 minutes I am asleep. The whole video keeps playing and in the morning I see my phone still playing videos! They are so calm and relaxing videos that they will never make you wake up in the middle of the night, rather if you will be having a bad dream or restlessness and you wake up abruptly due to any reason, the sound in your earphone will help you go back to sleep immediately!ASMR has helped many insomniacs cure their problem, and many depression and anxiety patients to feel calm and relaxed. You can give it a try :) It's not going to cost you anything after all! Just do this space exercise before going to sleep, and then play some ASMR video, plug your earphones, lie down, switch off all the lights, put your phone aside, and sleep peacefully!Here are some AWESOME ASMR Artists that I prefer on YouTube:GentleWhisperingAccidentallyGraceful ASMREphemeral RiftMassageASMRHeather Feather ASMRThere are hundreds of ASMR channels, but these 5 are the top favorites. You can browse these or you can discover more. There are a lot of people like you, but don't worry, it will all be alright. I hope this really helps you :) Good Luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"You cannotIf someone wants to believe something about him, let him believe it. You will say to him that he's perfect, that he's doing a lot already or that he's better than a thousand, but he won't listen to you as long as he doesn't want to believe it! Let him do whatever he wants to. I was the same in my engineering college. I used to participate in everything, join every society, organize events, get 8+ GPA every time in studies, regularly attend classes, write books side by side, get them published, participate in online contests, win them, I got stories published in national level books too, thinking that I am not doing enough, but eventually by Final year, when I looked back into 4 years of my computer engineering, I found out what I've done, people haven't even achieved a percent of it in their college lives! So your friend will eventually realize this thing all by himself. You don't need to force him. And rather it's fun! I used to sleep 4-6 hours a day, and throughout my 4 yrs of engineering I had no time for anyone or anything, and I really loved doing what I did. So if he loves doing it - let him do it! Don't STOP him. It's only 4 years after all, doesn't matter. He will come out with a great deal of experience and exposure. If you stop him, he will become miserable and feel empty all the time - so don't do that to him! Let him do whatever he wants to do, as long as he's doing it happily and by his own wish.

Mehek-Bassi,"Hi Miss Unknown,I don't think suicide is a great plan. I don't think you are loser either. Want to feel good in mere five minutes? Read ahead -Ups and downs are a part of everyone's life. First of all, I want to salute you on how you survived despite being in an abusive relationship. If you can survive that, can't you survive this? I don't think so!Being in and out of an abusive relationship, still strong. You are staying with your parents, that's a brave thing in itself! Your parents did a lot for you, they raised you, educated you and you know it better than me, right? Mothers and daughters, I believe have a strange relationship. Women can't be good-friends, right? And that is applicable even to mothers and daughters all around the world. We always love and adore those women who are inferior to us, or who depend on us in someway. The day we see a woman who is stronger than us, or who has survived the worst situations of life, we feel jealous. That moment, we are not proud of ourselves anymore. Our accomplishments and problems seem small as the achievements of the other woman are much higher, much stronger, much better!You are that other woman for your mother :) She knows you are a fighter and a survivor too! She is just testing your limits. She wants you to break down so that she can go back into the mother-mode and offer you help. But you are adamant. You are strong, you are iron-lady! You won't break down in front of her, and that's why she thinks you can handle yourself well now, and that you don't need her anymore. She is now extending her love to her son and Daughter-in-law because they are far, she thinks they need it. They value the little time they get while on call with her, and she thinks that's love, so she gives it back too! With you, she knows you will survive no matter the situation is how-so-ever bad, so she doesn't care anymore.But do you seriously think such a situation is worth dying for? NO! Don't even think about it. What you have done, is what 90% of us wouldn't have. What you have gone through is what 99% of us can't, and still you think that killing yourself is going to mend things? How?Rather, LIVE and inspire others! Share your story. The way your story inspired me today, I'm sure it can inspire a million others to see how a battle is not only fought but won too! If you think all the struggles and all the hardships that you went through were stupid then you can go ahead and plan a suicide, but let me tell you, that won't solve anything. If you can solve anything in the world, you can do it by being an inspiration! Talking about job and money now - how much is too much? The people who are earning millions are jumping for billions, those earning billions want to buy the moon, in short - nobody is satisfied, but a rickshaw-puller who sleeps peacefully every night! Let me tell you a true story now - my kaam-wali bai is more satisfied and happier than my mother. My mother always worries about finances, spending, saving etc etc. While my bai just takes home whatever money she earns, she takes away our used clothes happily and her kids sometimes accompany her on Sundays and she shows them the big cars and LCD - TVs that she sees at our place! Those kids are so happy by watching a match on the big-screen TV that I don't think that happiness can be matched even by earning 1 crore rupees! Because when you earn 1 crore, you are not happy, but you are worried because you will have to pay the income tax now, file it's return, save your ass from the inspectors who will ask you all the questions about that money! Isn't it better we earn a few thousands and live happily than earn millions and live like thieves?Satisfaction and contentment is in you. I don't say being rich is wrong, but being satisfied and happy is way more important than being rich! If you want to be happy in your salary, you will be, however if you don't want to be happy in it, you won't be happy even if you get it's double, because the day you will get double, you will start aspiring for triple and so on....money is nothing but numbers, and numbers are infinite :)You are 37. I am 22. You have seen and experienced life better than me. I am still in a shell, living with my parents and expecting to go out for post-graduation next year! I hope you can give yourself better answers than me. Good luck :)PS - Dying is never the solution. NEVER!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Okay, first of all - DON'T THINK about leaving your girlfriend at all!There are phases in everyone's lives. We all are at one point of time, very serious about life and career, and many times we just want to have fun, because we are not in pressure or we don't have any responsibilities. Your girlfriend sounds like a real deal to me! She has helped you, supported you in your ups and downs, been loyal to you since 7 years despite being in a long-distance (WOW! That's a big thing to do!) And she also helped you emotionally and financially, when mostly girls will think about running away in any such situation. So, she does sound like a real woman, and a very understanding person to me.Developing such kind of bonding with someone, trusting someone for 7 long years, and thinking about leaving them, certainly questions 'you', not her! She has been loyal and loving and supportive. She did all she could to help you, and now that you 'think' someone is 'appearing' to be better than her, you are thinking about leaving her which isn't cool. You said everyone likes her in the family - so basically you are axing out a perfect relationship, and inviting complications!Do you love her or not? Ask yourself! And I'm sure you do, it's just that because of very limited time spent together, you neither have any memories to cherish, nor you have any real dates to recall, so you think you don't love her, while that is NOT the case. Just because you met someone who appears to be better than her does NOT mean she can be a good choice OVER her, because of many points, some of which are -You are unaware of her past. You don't know how many boyfriends she dated or how many guys were there in her life. While with your girl, you are with her since 7 years - so there is no scope of any suspicion.You can't guarantee that someone will help you in your ups and downs. A person is tested only when the time arrives, and imagine you leave your girlfriend for such stupid stuff, and date this new office-chic who leaves you in your difficult time, you know - you will regret the most, and sadly you will be the most helpless person in that situation because you lost someone who stood for you, for someone who doesn't care!Are you sure that you will be happy with her? How can you guarantee happiness when you don't know the person? Compared to the seven year long relationship that you had with your girlfriend, you spent practically no time at all with this new girl! Doesn't matter if your relationship was working over the phone or messages or anywhere, what matters is that you SHARED your lives with each other!And after many years of relationship, when you guys will get married, you know you will thank yourself the most for keeping this relationship intact and making it successful! Then it won't matter if you didn't have any real dates or you didn't hang out or you didn't do stuff together, because you will have entire lives to hang out, make love and just do whatever you want to! Then you will realize how lucky you are to have such a wonderful girl, who didn't ran away, and rather waited for you for such a long time!I am also in a long distance relationship and I can perfectly relate to your situation you know why? Because in my relationship of 5 yrs, even I have met my guy for only 14 times in person, and many times in group out of that 14 times, to be shielded from showing off that we both are dating! Yes, Indian culture sucks at this, and now we are in such a long distance that we can't see each other for one whole year, but you know what I love the most about this relationship? It's the distance! I value him. I know when I will get to spend one whole day with him, I will not waste it. I will not argue or fight, I will spend it, cherish it and preserve it in my heart for years to come. I still get nervous when I see him although it's been 5 yrs together, because we couldn't spend any time together - so that excitement, that nervousness is still there. I can say whatever to him on phone, but in person, I still think a lot before speaking stuff, because of the distance that is between us. And I can't wait to marry him, you know why? Because there are still so many things uncovered and hidden about that person, that I can't wait to unfold the secrets and get to love him more!I'm sure your girl will also be having same level of excitement about you, but you are thinking about breaking up, which will only effect you in the end - note my point!You get irritated BECAUSE - you haven't spent any time with her, so everyday, discussing the same things annoy you! Try my advice for a day - call her up, and ask her how would she want your wedding to happen? And then you can discuss everything, from guest-list to food to honeymoon to your dream-destinations, and suddenly, you will start loving her again! You will not only want to be with her, but will want to marry as soon as possible to execute and live the life that you are seeing in dreams right now!And yes, it is perfectly normal in every long-term long distance relationship. You need to work out to make things better! Start calling her, discuss stuff that you would love to do together, ask her if she would like to accompany you to a sky-diving trip? Ask her about her biggest fears. Talk about fresh things, bring a newness in your relationship!No, you don't need to change or compromise or do any of the heavy stuff you are writing here! Relationships are like blessing, why are you taking it like a burden? Ask those guys whose girls left them hanging in the middle for someone who was smarter or richer than them, ask the guys who were ditched by their girls because a little distance came in between them. Ask the guys who lost their girlfriends because of their stupid decisions, and suddenly you will start feeling that you have a treasure with you, and you will never want to lose her to some other guy! NO! I hope I explained a lot to you. And I hope you will not make this mistake of breaking up with her :) Good luck! And sorry for such a long reply...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"You CANNOT!It's very difficult to admit and understand this fact that we can't control someone's life. Parents fail to understand this thing when the child enters his 20s. Boys drink and party outside their parents' notice, and if parents can fail to save their own children, saving someone else is simply a distant dream!You can save her, obviously if she listens to you, but you yourself said that she accused your mutual friend for being your puppet, what else can you expect? She will understand but in her own way, after failing and falling hard on this path of destruction that she has chosen for herself. If she doesn't want to save herself, you can't do anything in it, plus the biggest thing - she doesn't want to listen to you let alone obey you!If you ask her not to do one particular thing, she will simply say 'Mind your own business', and even if she obeys you, you never know if she's actually truthful or lying. She can do whatever she wants even behind your back and you will never come to know, because then she will start hiding things from you. This is what kids these days are doing to their parents!Hope you understand what I'm trying to say here. I'm not asking you to stop trying. Try all you want to, but this is a book whose end is determined, you can't change it! She will come on right path only when she will know that she is on a wrong path now, she thinks it's all right and what she's doing is so much fun. She isn't in a condition to listen to anyone right now!So, it's better that you don't waste your time! I understand that you love her and it's very tough to see someone you love in such a condition, but you don't have a choice here. Good luck! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"More than your talk or your conversation, what impresses a person in the first glance is - Your Dressing and Your Confidence!!You can be all interesting and funny that you want to, but it will all be useless, if you give a bad first impression. So first thing first - dress up nicely, groom yourself up before hitting your social gathering, and make sure you have washed your hair, shaved your beard (or at least trimmed or groomed it properly), clipped your nails etc etc. These things are very tiny little in observation, but put a DEEP impact on a girl! After dressing, work on your confidence level. Put up a big smile on your face when you talk to anyone, show confidence, strike up conversations and make sure you don't look nervous at all! It's a big turn off!You can compliment your crush on her looks, you can talk to her about 'general' stuff. There's no need to ask her for dance just in the beginning, that will look inappropriate and very desperate, rather wait for some time, talk to her about her personal life, like how many people she has in her family, where did she attend her college etc etc etc. You can talk about anything - even about work - as long as she is NOT bored or pissed off! The moment you sense that something is bothering her, or something she's not interested in - CHANGE the topic! Don't hang on to one thing for so long, she will walk up to someone else in the meantime! Social gatherings are for knowing each other more, and not discussing work, because you do that anyways for the rest of the year. So spare yourself the headache of talking about work with everyone, and even her! Talk about some other things, like what are her interests, whether or not she likes reading books or playing some sport, or even gardening. Tell her about yourself, tell her what you know, and talk to her about what you like to do in your spare time. Make her laugh if your sense of humor is good! But don't crack jokes that she would have to laugh upon forcefully! She will later on think what a stupid guy she wasted her time with...don't let that happen!And then, when you feel that you have talked to her enough, and she also starts being a little comfortable with you, then you can ask her for a dance. And she won't say no! Just be confident, and don't forget the 'smile'.Good Luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"We seek these 3 things because of the society! If you closely follow the lives of true 'saadhu' or 'Yogis', they have abandoned all materialistic greed and surrendered their lives to the ultimate-being - one soul, their own path of enlightenment and salvation. They don't do jobs or earn money. They don't marry, they remain celibate throughout lives, they don't have sex, their physical desires don't exist! They don't even seek death. They just welcome it, if it comes to them.Where as the normal human being is driven by society. We see Sharma-Ji's son clearing IIT, we can't be behind! We have to study science too and get into IIT and if we can't, we are the biggest failures! Basically, a normal human doesn't only run after money, partner or death, but after EVERYTHING that another person is running after! They don't care if that thing is going to help them or make their lives better in any way, but they just do it!Three guys got married and lived a happy life, and following them blindly, 3 other guys also got married. They ""thought"" they needed a partner to live a good life, and they married nice girls. All of the girls started annoying them! One of them got cheated on by his wife. The other one had to witness his wife run away with his driver. The third one's wife died of some illness. Basically they all suffered heavily because of their thought of 'needing' a wife! The one thing they thought was going to make their lives better, made their lives HELL!According to spirituality - you don't need anything or anyone to be happy! You are highly capable of being happy, living a good life, all on your own! You don't need millions of dollars or partner or cars or anything. But society has forced us to own such stuff. We see other people, we ""think"" they are happy, and we follow them blindly! We buy an Audi because Mishra-Ji also bought one last year, but we don't know that Mishra-Ji is now bankrupt and has no idea how to repay the loans of the car! We buy bigger apartment though there are only 4 people in the family, just because - Shukla Ji bought a  bigger apartment last month! What we fail to notice is that, Shukla-Ji's family of 9 people was difficult to accommodate in a smaller apartment!Basically what I want to say is - All our needs are different. All our requirements are different. We all dealing with our own problems. We all have our own circumstances and situations, but we forget all this when it comes to following someone! We just do it - BLINDLY!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Okay, you've got a problem that can easily be talked out.Go to your girlfriend, and tell her straight - man to woman - If you are going to talk with that guy in life, I will double date! I don't care if he had a crush on you, or still has a crush on you, or you are ignoring him, or whatever. Talk to him one more time, and wave me goodbye, it's either him or ME!I believe that 99% of the time, the situation can be easily controlled. Girls are fooled easily by guys, guys who pretend to be emotional, and pretend to be their friends, but only guys (the boyfriends/husbands I mean) know what all guys think about a girl (their girlfriend/wife)! The guy who your girl is talking to right now, isn't there for emotional support, right? He's not a fool. He's making his chance so that the moment your girl weakens up and talks about leaving you or being frustrated in this relationship with you, that guy has his chance, and he gets lucky with your girl - which is HORRIBLE!I have known this thing from long because my boyfriend is a supportive man (and aggressive and dominating too, and I really love that about him, the way he takes control of the relationship!) and he taught me all this about the guys, and now I am expert enough to talk to any guy of the world behind his back, because he trusts me enough that I will never let anybody flirt with me. Not even come close to flirting! Not because I am afraid of him or something, but because we both trust each other, and I respect my guy very much. And that trust and respect needs to be there in every relationship, believe me. Feminists might bark nonsense all the time that women should not listen to men, men should not dominate women, men should give freedom to their partners, men should not restrict women from wearing short clothes or going out naked, blah blah blah, but the rules that are set for women MUST be followed if you want to set a good example of a successful relationship for your coming generations, or else, they will also learn more about cheating and running away and breaking up, than about going through tough times together and still holding on.

It's after 18 that we are thrown out of the club as our membership has expired. Now we need to earn money to get back into the club. To earn, we need to make career for which we need to be serious enough. So from 18 till our early 20s, we notice everything.

We start churning the rational wheels of our minds and we bring up so many schemes and plans to make money, to establish a business or to set up a career. We do so many things, have so many experiences and gain exposure. We do all this so that we can earn money and get the membership back! Ultimately when we start earning our money, we think - Nah, this club is just a wastage of time, let's work hard for that big club!

When it was about the love and dates and making out and kissing and hugging, both the partners were so happy and actively involved, isn't it? Now when the time of struggle has arrived, you lost it so easily and want to run away? If you think you can get everything for free, you are in a grave misunderstanding! You need to fight for the best things, and the things that come for free - are CHEAP and not the best ones!FIGHT! Fight is what makes a relationship WORTHY!

Something that no other guy can understand, because for them, you will be an arranged-trophy wife! What if your arranged Telugu husband turns out to be a jerk? What is the guarantee that you fill find a perfect prince-charming guy for yourself? What if he has an on-going affair? What if he refuses to have sex with you because he still loves his girlfriend? (This has happened to one of my close friends, so it's not a joke!). What if he rapes you? Marital rape isn't uncommon in India! What is the guarantee that this guy will respect you and love you and treat you with as much dignity as your boyfriend can and will? No guarantee, right?Then HOW can you take such a fucking-big risk with your entire life? Can you not understand this simple thing yourself? Why have you closed your eyes?I hope you take the right decision! And if you still dump your guy and marry someone of your parent's choice, then I hope that your guy becomes the most successful and richest man of the country and marries a LOYAL and TRUSTWORTHY woman in his life, who ACTUALLY loves him, and not just pretends - like you!I'm sorry if my answer sounded rude or pathetic or whatever. But all that I have spilled above - is RAW TRUTH! Taking a stand for relationship is something that only people with guts do these days. And it makes me sad that everyday on Quora I find people like you who are talking about breaking up and marrying a person of parent's choice. If you had to marry someone of your parents' choice, why the FUCK did you come in a relationship with ANYONE? Why spoil someone's life? Open your eyes and you will see how wrong and shallow you are talking...Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"This is a very common situation - or very common on Quora I think!See, if you love someone - it's YOUR problem, and if someone loves you back - it's your LUCK - if someone doesn't - it's your DESTINY! You can't make someone love you forcefully, and if someone you love, already loves someone else, then you can't do anything in this situation, but move on.Waiting in a hope that she will start loving you someday, is like waiting for the earth to start revolving in another direction! It can't happen if she's already into a stable relationship, and if her guy, loves her too. Waiting can ""possibly"" turn favorable for you, you never know if she is in your destiny and someday you get her as well! But let's leave the hypothetical things aside for a while, and focus more on practicality. Practically waiting for things like this (things that are purely based on luck) to happen is very stupid. If it has to happen it will happen, but then you can't spend your entire life waiting for it, right?So, it's better to move on, and focus on your life. Work in the direction of your dreams. Fulfill your dreams, your parents' dreams, LIVE! Don't die for someone who has a thin chance of brightening your life - rather LIVE for yourself, your parents, family, who did so much for you :) Good Luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"If you want to be successful only for the sake of taking revenge - you will never be satisfied with your life!Let me give you an example here:Suppose, a girl left guy-A and she found guy-B who was earning twice the guy-A. Guy-A will think that she dumped him because of money. Suppose guy-A earned 25K and guy-B earned 50K. Now guy-A wants to be successful just to show the girl that she has done a grave mistake in leaving him. He works hard, very hard and opens his own company worth $10 million! He employed guy-B as his workman under him. He meets him on an official party, where guy-B also brought his wife along. The girl who left the guy-A years ago, is happy to see that he is now the owner of a big company.Girl: Congratulations!Guy-A: Thank you. You must be repenting now. For leaving me?Girl: What? I never left you for money! *laughs*Guy-A: What? Then why did you leave me?Girl: Because Guy-B is a better person than you! Look at yourself, you have everything, yet you have nothing! *leaves*BANG! The success of guy-A now seems stupid, idiotic and very immature. The girl left guy-A for his nature, of being shrewd and money-minded, while she is happy in her middle-class life with guy-B who is working under guy-A, but the girl doesn't care. She loves guy-B so much that guy-A can NEVER be successful enough to win that love back no matter what he does! Guy-A might be 100 times richer than guy-B, but he is still SMALL to him compared to the kind of personality he owns.So, if you want to be successful, do it for yourself, not for the sake of revenge, because revengeful success, can never lead to satisfaction or happiness. The above stated conversation was just a fictional example, but what I wanted to say here is that - if you want to be successful to show-off to someone, you will end up making a fool of yourself!Good Luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"LOL! This question reminds me of my parents too, who are in their fifties, and all they did was ask me to get married 'everyday 24/7'! I was so annoyed but now it's fine as my father started some new side-business last month, so they are pretty much into that. To keep your parents calm and at peace, and busy, you need to find something that they love to do!For Example: Get your parents tickets to movies, so that they can watch movies, and have a good time together. Ask them to have dinner outside, roam the city, have fun and spend time with each other. That way you will have plenty of time for yourself! Or teach your mother how to watch videos on YouTube. Believe me, she will forget that you are her son! It has helped me a lot! Since the day I gave a smart-phone to my mom and taught her to watch videos of cooking, beauty-tips and any other topic they are interested in, she is so into it, she has maintained this huge 'watch later' list that she plays immediately when she gets time from her household chores. And the biggest benefit of it is - she no longer watches stupid TV Serials! Basically, internet can solve your problem :) Good Luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Let's read what you said in your question first:There was a girl who used to have feelings for me for around 1-2 years but at that time I did not felt anything for her.After some time I actually had some feelings for her.She is also saying that I was very disgusting for the reason i made her wait a lot for the love before.And now you say 'She betrayed me. She said on social site that she never loved me'.Tell me one thing - HOW IS THAT A BETRAYAL? If we read YOUR points, where you 'claim' that you had no feelings for her, and you didn't love her in your relationship, how can you blame her that she betrayed you?You two were together for 2 years. You didn't love her. She didn't love you. IT'S EQUAL. NOBODY BETRAYED ANYBODY. Then you BROKE up and now she loves someone else! Now that finally she has found someone to love, and finally she's found a good relationship to be in, you want her to breakup and be with you again? The guy she termed to be 'disgusting' for making her wait for 2 years? I don't think she will. And honestly I don't think any girl would do that! If you couldn't realize your feelings for her in the 2 years till the time you were in a relationship with her, you NOW have no right to demand back a relationship when she's finally moved on and happy with someone else. When you HAD her, you didn't value her, and now that she's gone, you want her back? This world is NOT a lost-and-found department dear. Once you lose something, it's gone forever. Move on now. And find someone whom you love, and who loves you back as well. And for GOD'S SAKE let your 'ex' be happy with her new guy and in her new relationship! Don't play with someone's (two people) happiness now.",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"You are the reason why your guy doesn't trust you!IMAGINE yourself at his place and think - what if you had asked him to NOT talk to girls, and he did? What if you asked him not to attend a particular party, and he did? What if you had asked him not to do something for you, and he did? What then? Would you trust him? Leave trust, would you be with him for so long?I am still surprised that your guy is patient enough to be with you which is a big thing for me! And now coming to the trust-thing. Building trust is the toughest thing in any relationship and breaking it, is obviously the easiest. What you did has not only broken, but shattered his trust, and no matter what, he will never trust you, and the credit goes to you!What should be done in such situations, where you have to attend a party and your boyfriend doesn't want you to go?You TALK to him. You don't attend the party and later on come home and tell him that you attended it, but you talk to him about it, you make him understand how important it is for you to attend it and then ask him to allow you. This should work both ways. I'm not saying only a girl should ask permissions, if a guy is restricting a girl, he should also be prepared to get restricted on the same grounds. But if he is genuinely concerned about you, then there's no fault. There are obviously MORE limits on girls than boys because - YES, we are girls and we can get raped or molested or anything bad can go down and we won't be able to control the situation, so the males who are concerned, are absolutely RIGHT in that matter. If there is a party that you have to attend, and he doesn't want you to go - Take him along! That will give him a sense of security as well as that will build his trust on you. He will see you interacting with your male-friends and he'll know that there's nothing wrong that you are doing, so from future onward, he will simply never restrict you!Coming on - talking to guys. This thing has to be sorted by TALKING. Talk to your boyfriend about it, and ask him the solution to it. Don't fight/argue, maybe he has a genuine point, so listen to him, and then ask him to present with a solution.Guys are different than girls when it comes to problem solving and giving them a problem is a GOOD THING because that instills in them a sense of responsibility and dependency. They will feel responsible for you. They will see you being dependent on them, and they will love you more for coming to them for a solution! Ask your guy what should you do in any such situation and I am sure he will help.Trust will be build slowly. I am not asking you to breakup because that would be utterly stupid. I am just asking you to talk to your guy, be frank with him, tell him you are sorry for your behaviour, tell him that now you understand everything and that you were immature earlier, and tell him that you will listen to him and obey him.There's nothing wrong in obeying your partner, although the feminists have made a big-deal out of it! I find it rather cute that the guy, is caring for his girl, he is being handed out certain responsibilities and he is the one who is in-charge of the relationship. The girl can simply be carefree and have all the fun in the world if the guy is understanding and the girl is 'obeying'!Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Confess it to him once again, maybe he says a yes this time? You can't say what fate has in store for you unless you make efforts. And if it's a no, then move on. There's no point of reading a book again, when you know how it's going to end! Moving on can be difficult but not impossible. And don't be disheartened because he said a 'no', maybe there is some better guy waiting for you? How will you get to him unless you shed your excessive baggage? And that excessive baggage is this - this one-sided love, which is always painful.Life doesn't stop or end at one person. True that we start thinking of that person to be our world, but there are 7 billion people in the world, and out of those 7 billion - what's the point of loving 1 person, who doesn't love you back? And it is highly possible that there also exists someone else who loves you, but you're not ready to see him yet because you are blinded by your one-sided love. Come out of the illusion (yes I will call it an illusion because there's no reality in it), and see the world, give a chance to someone who loves you and see how different life feels! Maybe you fall in love with him?Now coming to the bigger picture. Even if you end up being together with your one-sided love-partner, there are 2 roads from that point:Maybe he loves you and showers all the happiness of the world on you. Then it's a win-win situation for both!But maybe (and this maybe has a higher probability of happening) he subconsciously has this thing in his mind that 'YOU' are already too obsessed with him (you love him since 3 years), so he starts taking you for granted. His behavior towards you is cold and he doesn't value you despite being in a relationship. What's the point of all the efforts at the end of it? One sided love, turned into both-sided relationship, which further turned into only one sided relationship. You will be back at square one. Earlier you were asking for a relationship, now you will be asking for what - time and value and respect and love?I can only suggest, decision is yours! I'd say ask him once, if he's willing to give it a try, otherwise move on. You are just living in an illusion that someday you both might end up being together, while it might not be the case!Take Care :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Love and Fights go hand in hand!Those who think that one casual fight can end the love, they are deeply mistaken, rather every fight can increase the love, if you make-up properly! Fighting is important in relationships, as saying 'I Love You'. An overly sweet and calm relationship is nothing but a bag of boredom. A relationship where there are fights, arguments, patch-ups, is something that defines 'life'. What if life? A series of ups and downs. Staying constantly in one place, starts to bore us and we get frustrated, and that is why it is said that you should 'avoid' marrying someone who possesses all your interests! Because after a few years, you won't find anything new in the relationship, left to unfold, rather you will run out of topics to talk! I'm not saying relationships between ditto-similar people don't work at all, it depends from couple to couple. That is why it is said ""Opposites Attract"".I and my boyfriend, we fight every day over one thing or the other, but we have made a promise to each other that no matter what, we will never go to bed angry. So by the end of the day, either it is my fault, or his, we say sorry and make-up. When I came into relationship with him, I never thought we would go so far. I'm dating him since 5 years now, and never did I think about marrying him either - but now I am! The fights and arguments are HIGHLY responsible for bringing us closer. They help us understand each other's point of view and see the world from a different perspective, and hence, be more tolerant. Let me give you a little example here - I used to be a non-vegetarian 2 years back, but my boyfriend is a vegetarian since we came into a relationship. We both never interfere in each other's lives so much that we stop each other or impose restrictions, so he never asked me to stop eating non-veg food, however, he never allowed me to eat non-veg while on dates, which I obeyed since it was the only thing he ever asked of me! And eating vegetables for one day wouldn't KILL ME! But Eventually I stopped eating meat/chicken because of my own personal wish, and my friends started teasing me that I'm doing it because of him, and if I tell them that he never had a problem with me eating meat, none of them believe it! But the truth is - every relationship should/must have a scope of personal-space where you can be yourself, and where you don't have to live someone else's life - and MORE THAN THAT PERSONAL SPACE - there needs to be a mutual understanding between partners. Before he could ask me to stop eating meat, I stopped it myself. I know he doesn't like it, and I respect his choice as well! But those who think that I stopped because of his 'force' or 'restriction', can never understand that I actually stopped it because 'I Love Him More' than any of my habits that I can give up for him!So, in every relationship, fights are important, but what's mandatory is personal space and sense of understanding so that those fights don't become a reason of breaking up!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"It's very tough, but you can do it!Having a a dream about spending life together is enough to create that space in our heart for that special person, and when that person leaves or that dream is crushed, a void is created which can't be filled. In your case, the same has happened, and I (anyone) would suggest you to just move on! She is married to someone else, and you have to accept this fact, that another man is now having all the rights on her, mentally, socially and physically. He is the one who is her husband now, and you are totally out of the picture here.I don't know about the behavior of the other guy, but if he is possessive or insecure for his wife, I don't think he will even allow her to have contacts with you, now that she is married. However, if you try to contact her and keep in touch, be her friend, problems might arise in her married life, which is NOT good. Married life once disrupted, can destroy the entire life of a person! And you don't want to do that to your friend, do you?She is married. She is gone. You have to accept it and move on. Distract yourself from her thoughts, her memories. If there are things that remind of her, lock them, or throw them if you can't make peace with them. Join a gym, hang out with your friends, make more friends, sing and dance, basically keep yourself so busy, that you don't even have time to think about her. Once you have your daily routine set-up, you will move on in no time. It's tough, but you can do it. If you are dedicated enough, you can do it.

BULLSHIT!Those who are leading them, have no knowledge of it either. They are blinded by other people, the heads of ISIS for that matter, who believe that spreading Islam in world, or converting people into Islam is the only motive of their lives. Allah has sent them to make conversions, to kill people, kill women and children, rape women, behead people, bomb people, destroy cities, destroy the communities and societies, while all this will lead to nothing, but self-destruction. Ultimately Muslims are killing Muslims in Syria, Palestine and other parts of West. Sunni Muslims are killing Shia Muslims, and now Shia are attacking the Sunni.Terrorism is not the way. And they don't know it. They think suppressing women, killing them, or making them wear burqa all day, keeping them inside houses, marrying multiple women, increasing prostitution, raping women of other religions, indulging in incest, is going to build a better society, while it's not so. Only peace and tolerance can build a better society. The terrorists are uneducated people, having no knowledge of how the world works or how they can peacefully propagate and spread their religion if they want to. But no, they want the whole world to turn Islamic overnight. And even if that will happen, then also, the wars won't stop.

Best things don't come for free in life, and free things are never best, I hope you understand what I'm saying here. The point is - you need to make your parents understand that this is your damn life and your damn relationship and that you love that girl. No matter what happens you're going to marry her. Do you care about the money or your life? How much has been spent on the engagement? Is it more than the value of your life? You can always earn money in future but can you change your life partner? What if this Arranged girl doesn't love you? And mark my words she can't ever love you like your ex did, because she doesn't know the value of having you after struggles and difficulties. You are going to lose out on someone who loved you with a true heart and a true soul. And if she gets married to someone ten times richer than you, oh boy how badly you're going to regret!! Ask your father to leave his shallow mentality behind and stop judging people with amount of money in their bank accounts! That's cheap. What if you got rejection from a girl's family who is ten times richer than you, just because you are poor compared to them, how will you feel? You made your ex feel the same and it's no good. Think about the things from her side, and think of what a cheap thing your family did. You are accountable for an apology to her and her family. If you care a little about your life or your future, I'm sure you will marry your ex even though you have to fight for it! Shah Rukh Khan married Gauri who was not only way richer than him but even a Hindu. If SRK would have thought that he cannot go against his family and he will marry some muslim woman, would we have a legendary love story around us? Gauri's father didn't approve of SRK because he was financially incomparable to them, but look what happened. Do I need to tell you what happened? No!

Mehek-Bassi,"Looking young has a lot to do with what you eat/drink. If you smoke/drink alcohol, STOP It! They make you look older and they suppress the collagen production which is responsible for new skin-cells which give you that youthful look. The collagen production reduces automatically when we hit our mid-30s, but looking older at 21 can be treated easily just with diet change! It needs a lot of dedication though -Include fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet, consume less caffeinated beverages or even tea (cutting-chai - not good!). If you drink beer or any other alcoholic beverage, reduce the consumption immediately, it would be best if you just stop it! Include Green Tea in your diet, preferably at night before you go to sleep.Start working out. Working out makes you sweat and the toxins are released out of your body through it, thus making your skin look younger and the body feel better. Take a diet rich in proteins and anti-oxidants. You can find anti-oxidants in fruits like strawberries, oranges, raspberries, blackberries but I know it's difficult to find the raspberries and blackberries in India, so you can always take orange-juice or have black/green grapes. Oranges are also good for collagen production. For collagen production you can also take foods like - spinach, broccoli, lemons, grapefruits, oranges, basically the fruits that are rich in Vitamin-C (sour fruits). You must include nuts in your diet - almonds, walnuts and cashew-nuts (for taste). I mix them in yogurt and eat!If you want your body and skin to look young & flawless, you HAVE to work for it. Nobody else is going to feed you these things everyday. I am following this routine since years now. Although I am addicted to coffee, but now I have controlled it as well, I drink it only twice a week now, and I am going to cut it out completely very soon! The source for all this information is only 'me' as I have tried and tested these things personally, and they work! The minute you make a change in your diet, your body responds quickly! The response initially will be awesome, but after sometime, it will slow down as your body gets used to it, but that doesn't mean you should stop taking it. The diet-plan is simple, I am not asking you to stop eating any particular thing, just INCLUDE the things I mentioned in your already on-going diet, and see the difference! You just need to be focused and dedicated, that's the key and that is what separates losers from winners in every field ;)Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"I am a very different kind of person, so my answer might not be totally in agreement with your viewpoints, but here is what I think - Negativity attracts negativity. I know you might think this is some kind of spiritual shit I am going to talk about, but if, for two minutes, you forget everything and just read with an open mind, you will definitely find the solution to your problem.Your girlfriend did bad with you. She used you. Ditched you. Betrayed you. Married someone else. Hung you in the middle. She is a bad woman!But how do you deal with bad people? Is it the first time you are meeting a bad person? NO. Is it the last time you are meeting a bad person? Not possible because this world is full of assholes! So, basically you are going to meet bad people everyday, every week, and how do you deal with them? If they use you, how do you still keep yourself composed and happy?By NOT thinking about it. It's a matter of self-control. If you continuously think about the bad things happened with you, you will feel more bad, and with that bad-feeling increasing you are doing nothing but attracting negativity, which is further contributing to nothing but anger, hatred, jealousy, remorse and feeling of betrayal. All this will impact your mental and physical health greatly. So the best remedy is - put on some music, dance like no one's watching! Okay, think about when did you last have fun? As in, when was the last time you laughed out loud, or you felt so happy that you were at the top of the world? It's been very long, right? You need to become that person! You need to go back to what that person was, and you need to get some positivity in your life.One way to do it is - shunning all negative thoughts about your ex or your relationship or her deeds. Whenever your brain starts to remind you about the stupid stuff, just tell him to 'shut-up' and focus on your life, your job, your study or whatever it is that you are doing! Don't think that revenge will sort things out, it won't, it will rather worsen things and you will end up feeling even bad because a phone call to her mother or her fiance would end up destroying her life too! If you want to destroy her life, then the best thing to do is - WAIT.Wait till Karma screws her! And I am NOT joking here. Karma is something that takes back for you, and in your case also it will! You just need to be a little patient and wait. Revenge is stupid, wait is the new cool. Do your things, do your job, focus on your life, start making it better, and don't waste your precious time on planning a revenge, because you have already spoiled a lot of years of your life on her, and what did you get in the end?I can suggest you two things to read at this point of time -MOVING ON & HATING - Moving on and HatingBREAKUP & REVENGE - Breakup and Revenge!These two articles are from my blog, where I not only address relationship problems but also try to help people who are hanging between suicide and a forced life.

Even I don't have normal teeth, there's a gap in the middle of my front teeth, just like Madonna! And BEFORE Madonna, even a front-gap was considered ugly. Madonna just changed the perception of it and now we think it's sexy. I want to say that - if I was born in pre-Madonna era, then I don't think guys would talk to me because of my teeth, but the one who would, would know that there's much more in a person than 32 teeth, 2 eyes, 2 ears or 1 nose!So what is ugly today, can be sexy tomorrow. If anyone's teeth are crooked or splayed, he/she can go for a treatment any time and get them straightened up, there's no issue in that. But judging him or his personality would be TOO Quick a decision to make just based on a set of teeth! Maybe that person is really good at heart? Or maybe he's very intelligent and smart?

Mehek-Bassi,"Authors are blessed with a vivid imagination, and a power to write a story, without having experienced the situation themselves. Talking about Prison Break, it wasn't written by particularly one person. Many people are involved in writing the storyline and depicting scenes in as realistic way as possible. If an author is writing a murder story, doesn't mean he has to commit a murder himself to understand the pros and cons of the story, similarly, he doesn't need to visit/stay in a prison to experience the life inside. It's taken from everyday perspectives of criminals, the various movies and shows in which the life inside a prison is showcased etc. The power to writing a story is only inside one's imagination. You need to know the beginning of the story, and the end. Connecting it becomes very easy when you know that you have to take your story from 'A' to 'Z'. Unsuccessful are those, who know the A, B, C, but can't reach the 'Z' (like Indian serials, which are never-ending) or simply set camps at any middle alphabet, making the story boring or stupid or ending it abruptly at some stupid place (like many Indian serials which ended suddenly, just because of low TRP) :D",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"You NEED a social circle!There are times that we want to be alone, but we can't stay in that bubble for long. It will lead to self-destruction some-day. You will sit at home, you won't have anything else to think about but your personal problems. You won't see anything but your family, quarreling or having differences, which won't help you either. Staying in one place is anyways dangerous. You need a vacation! Go out with someone. You don't have friends, no problem, you might have siblings or cousins? Plan out some tours with them, even if they are one-day tours, but do plan out something to divert yourself from the on-going drama in your life, it will bring a fresh change, you see.Above all, you need friends! They are the most important part of anyone's life. You need to hang out with people, talk to them, listen to them, basically have a social life. Even if you are in distant learning program, you might be having some school friends, isn't it? Catch up with them, plan hang-outs, and meet them often. It will solve 90% of your problems!Being alone isn't the solution. Good luck! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Alright, this is a very common scenario, but always remember that the opportunities in life, don't come twice!Okay, so tell your boyfriend that this is once in a lifetime chance for you, and believe me, your world will be changed once you return here with a foreign degree plus a world class exposure. Tell him that you will continue this relationship. Believe me, long distance relationship is possible, it can be nurtured and I have been doing it since 5 years! If I can do it for 5 years (including 1.5 year of not seeing him at all), then I think anyone can do it. It's not impossible. You just have to maintain the trust and have to be in touch with each other as much as you can.In today's world, I don't think any woman wants to sit at home and wash dishes. Everyone wants to work, right? And it makes such a good impression on our guys and their lives too! Like imagine, you are coming back to India after a year or so, and you get to meet your guy and his friends, it will be such a proud moment for him to introduce you to his friends! You will feel this thing inside, and it's good for the relationship too. Long distance won't stay forever, will it? If you guys eventually get serious, you can always marry and this long distance will end right there and then, but the graduation-opportunity won't strike again. This is the age. This is the time, and this is the right time I tell you. Make a decision, convince your boyfriend, tell him that he has to trust you, and he has to handle this relationship for the time you are out. Everything will be alright very soon, sooner than you know!And I really hope you take the right decision. Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low

You CANNOT be rejected just because you aren't interested in sports!Many girls don't like cooking, are they rejected?Many girls don't like wearing make-up, are they rejected?A personal choice cannot determine a person's nature, similarly you cannot get selected/rejected on the base of your choice or your field of interest. A person is MUCH MORE than what he likes/dislikes, what he loves/hates!If you can't play any sport or aren't interested in any, there must be something else you might be good at, right? Focus on that! If you are good at anything else, say - painting, music, playing any instrument or singing, you can NEVER get rejected because in my opinion I find sportsmen a little shrewd and selfish :P I am dating a guy who was a state-level chess player and was also in his college football team, and he is crazy about football. He won't pick up my calls and can even cancel a date if there's a Manchester United match going on! I would personally prefer someone who is more emotional and sensitive and sportsmen are quite ruthless in my opinion :P No offence to anyone here, especially not my guy, but yeah, hope you got my point!

Mehek-Bassi,"I can think of only one thing right now - Everyone gets old subsequently. Why to look for something that is depreciating with every passing day? Yes, I am talking about looks! Looks don't stay forever. Doesn't matter if the person is breathtakingly beautiful, he will get old someday, isn't it? Then why run after something that is NOT permanent? Same is the case with money! Money is something that is NOT permanent either! Someone who is rich today, can be bankrupt tomorrow, and someone who is poor and living in streets today, can rise to stardom. It's a matter of luck, destiny and your hard-work and dedication. What matters is the love and nature of that person that never (NEVER!) fades with time or changes! Love is like wine - it becomes richer with time. And nature of the person is something that will stay with him even after he gets wrinkled skin and grey hair and painful joints. If a person is good at heart - he can prove to be a much better choice than someone who is ONLY beautiful but with a coal-black soul! What's the use of beauty if your partner can't respect you or your parents or your family? What's the need of such a beauty where your partner can't appreciate anything in life, but is only proud of being beautiful! What's the need of marrying such a shallow person? Ultimately, what will matter in life after 10, 20, 40 or 50 years is that - how many days you LIVED and LOVED, rather than for how many days someone looked beautiful! Because at the end - we all will age and wrinkle and have grey hair, with a lot of problems and diseases.Your parents will understand.

But - I can give you one very simple advice that one of my seniors gave me -Do what you LOVE!Ruby and Java are both very popular technologies, and they won't be outdated any soon either, so you decide what you are more interested in. Since Ruby is something that you have a job-experience in as well, so you can get better packages at early stage in that field, while with Java, you have no work experience so far, so you will be treated more or less as a fresher in that field. Plus it again comes down to one thing - what do YOU want to do?In the end, after 10-20 years, it won't be about money because you will have a lot of it anyways, it won't be about your post/position in the company either because that can also improve in that much time, it will all boil down to only one thing - how much do you LOVE your job?

If someone is earning money - we think his life is luxurious, he can afford good things, he can afford better car, what we forget is that - both Honda City and Mercedes S-Class can hold not more than 5 people, both run only on road, and both live on diesel/petrol! There's nothing fancy in getting a car worth Rs. 80 Lac or 1 crore, but people would take loan to get that car so that they can show their relative or neighbor that they can also afford it! They don't care from where the money comes from, they will take heavy loans without planning on how to repay it, they will do anything to prove their might. What they forget in all this is - no matter in how much big/small house you live, how ever big/small/tiny car you drive, or even you drive a bicycle, in the end, we all end up in a box of - 6X3.",high,high,high,low,low

It's all about destiny!I have no other answer but 'destiny' because I have seen many asshole-guys break heart of innocent girls, I have seen many slutty girls breaking hearts of good guys, and I have also seen many good girls, getting married to bad boys and the bad-boys eventually turn good after marriage and their relationship is super successful! In my life of 22 years, I've seen enough to conclude that anything is possible in this world. You can't say that good guys don't get girls or bad guys always get good girls, I have seen bad guys getting screwed over by the girls they are serious for - which eventually pushes them into a never-ending trauma and drugs and alcohol and they end up spoiling themselves. I've also seen bad girls getting ditched by their boyfriends and they end up getting married to guys arranged by their parents and families - basically anything is possible!You just need to wait, there will be a girl in your life too, but it is rightly said - Nobody gets anything ""Before time, and more than destiny""! (वक़्त से पहले और किस्मत से ज़्यादा ना किसी को कुछ मिला है, ना मिलेगा)Till then, just keep trying.

Mehek-Bassi,"ASK YOURSELF WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO!Relatives. Family. Parents. Siblings. Neighbors. Neighbor's Dogs. Stray Cats - nobody, I repeat NOBODY has to live your life, but YOU! Do you want to listen to them and get married and then regret that why didn't you work and made a career first? That's insane! And if that happens, nobody is at fault but you - YOU! You listened to people. You took their advice. You had no stand of your own. You got married. You spoiled your career. Then later in life, you can't BLAME your parents or neighbors or anybody for forcing you to get married! They didn't tie you up in ropes and walked you around fire with some strange man and got you married, did they? Then why can't you simply say NO and do what you want to do? What is so difficult about it?Well my point is - marriage just shoves a lot of responsibilities and tasks and duties and stuff that refrains you from focusing on your career and being successful, especially when you are in the initial stage of your career. You should marry when you have worked in a job for 2-4 years, you have experience, you know you can do work, you are THROUGH your learning period, and you can get another job easily, and you don't have to worry about preparing for exams or going through training programs etc. Then get married! So that, after marriage, you can also enjoy your personal life, as well as have a satisfactory and easy going professional life. Initially in everyone's career, the job is TOUGH and low paying. With time, it gets easier and manageable and high paying too. And you don't want to get married in that tough-phase of your job where you are working for 12 hours, getting low salary and not even happy with your partner because hey, after 12 hours of work, who has any energy left? Handling career and spouse becomes impossible in such a case! You are forced to choose between the two because initially both - job and marriage - require your utmost attention and time!So think about it, and then take the decision. And don't get carried away so easily. Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"First conversations are really important because they will mark your image in her mind forever! She will never forget the first words you said to her, because that is the story that will be narrated to your kids and grandkids in future, so be careful with that.You can always be subtle and decent, so always ask her how is she and how is her day, how is she feeling, and if she's comfortable. Depends upon where you are at the moment, if you are at home (yours or hers) then you can ask her about her day and all, and if you are outside, like in a restaurant, then you can offer her the menu card to order whatever she likes - this will mark a great impression, believe me! Always, let the lady order, and always let the man pay on the first date, these are the basic rules of decency!Once she is comfortable, you can ask her about her interest in college subjects, or sports or whatever she did, her hobbies and interests, don't be an interviewer, rather ask her, and try to frame a conversation upon that. For example - if she likes cooking, ask her what she cooks best? If she says 'Sambhar', then tell her that you would love to taste it someday. You get me? Follow up from her answers and frame the questions based on them. Don't make her feel like she's sitting in an interview, like you ask her:What do you like to do? She says - I like to cook.What else do you like to do? She says - I also love to paint.Okay.That's BORING! Don't do that. Always show interest in whatever she is saying, doesn't matter how boring or stupid it is. You can always correct her later, first date isn't RIGHT time to be the scrutinizer!Make her feel good, make her laugh. Tell her about your work, your job, but then again - Don't BORE HER! Always see her reaction first and then continue. If she's interested in your work, tell her more, by more I mean ""a little"" more, don't start with the details like - In 2010 when I passed out from ABC college, I got recruited into XYZ company and on the first day my manager asked me to make an excel sheet about the progress...blah blah...YUCK!She isn't interested in your company or your manager, but she's interested in YOU as a person, so give her more of that! Talk about your job, but just tell her what you do - I make excel sheets for my company. Simple. Short. Subtle.Talk to her about your future plans - I am thinking to change my field and get into marketing. Keep it simple and short!Tell her about the funny incidences of your life, but they have to be really funny, and not 'made-up' funny or 'tried a lot to laugh but could not' funny. If you don't have any funny incidences, then it's fine, just be yourself, don't pretend to be someone you're not! She has to spend your life with you and not with an impersonator that you were trying to be on your 1st date!Also, if you are sitting in a restaurant or something, NEVER call the waiter rudely! Rather treat him with respect. Else it will make you look like a dictator or a show-off and you don't want to make her run away on the first date itself!Good luck! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Lack of content! Take TV serials for instance (Balika Vadhu, Sasural Simar Ka). The problem with us is we settle for far low than we deserve! Indian television is going through it's worst phase right now, I'd say, when American TV series like Forever, Fringe, Friends etc have done exceptionally good, India is degrading it's quality day by day. The problem is NOT only content, but population.It's simple math. We are now almost 132 crore people. Whatever you serve on TV, will be watched by at least 0.1% of the population (the lowest you can assume) and that 0.1% is enough to make them money to sponsor more episodes, hence the shit. Cartoons are the same. Kids watch only a few channels - Disney, Pogo, Hungama and Cartoon Network - on these channels, we have pathetic shows going on, which are watched by kids for two reasons -1. They don't have an alternate choice! The American serials are deliberately aired in English, and not every child is fluent in English in India at the age of 3-10, so they have no choice but to settle for stupid cartoons like - Oggy and the Cockroaches or Chota Bheem.2. They can't STOP watching it or protest against it, which maintains the TRP - which makes money for the producers and hence they air more episodes and more stupidity. Same is the case with Indian TV Serials. So, unless we sit on a 'dharna' for better shows or stop watching TV altogether for one month at least, only then we can expect some change.

If the amount is good enough, they will stick to you like bee to honey, and if not, they will be repelled away immediately! It's societal norm now. And WE have made this stupid culture! What do we do all day? 90% of our leisure time of each day is consumed by internet or on TV and on both these platforms we read/hear about people who made it big - whether it be Shah Rukh Khan or Anil Ambani or Tata-Birla or the Mittals and Mallyas, all we hear about is money, money and money. There is no other news about personality of a person, except for if that person suddenly dies like - Dr APJ Abdul Kalam! Did we hear a news everyday about him on TV or Internet? No, only when he died, the whole country knew how humble and decent and very down to earth that man was, how he lived a middle class life, and had no great bank balance but still managed to live a life of dignity and respect. People hear such news, feel emotional and patriotic for a day or two and again move on to materialistic needs and desires. It will go on as it has no solution.

And love at first sight is such a hollow concept - how can you even think of spending your entire life with someone just by seeing his/her face? What if s/he turns out to be a jerk and abusive partner in future? What then?Ask yourself if you really want to live with her in future, if you want to see her as your partner, down the line, if you want her to accompany you everywhere, or you want to be there for her every time she needs you - and the most important thing - ask yourself if you are ready to Forgive her if she makes a big mistake!

Mehek-Bassi,"No. Not at all! There is a very common misbelief that we humans have, and that is - things of past, bring back bad memories or create rift in present. It's not always so. When your boyfriend was with his ex, he might also have had his moments of happiness and good times that he would cherish throughout his life. It may hurt you today, but it's an undeniable truth.He might not agree with it, but when he was in his relationship previously, its not the case that everyday was bad. The gifts are therefore, the memory of good times shared. They are like trophies from life - trophies of earning good memories and good lessons. Something that I think we should all keep and not throw away :)If you look at it from another perspective, the gifts can make your relationship even better! Let me tell you how - His gifts have nothing to do with you. He has already had his moments with his ex and is now in a relationship with you. The gifts are there to remind him of his ex, of the bad time they faced, of the lessons he learnt, so that - He DOES NOT let it happen again. He does not let this relationship with you, break apart. The gifts are poor innocent souls and have nothing to do with you both, but they do play a crucial part in strengthening your relationship. However, if you feel uncomfortable about his gifts, he might also feel that you are an overly insecure girlfriend. But if you feel cool about it, they might not even affect him to the least.

Mehek-Bassi,"How would you feel if your partner has feelings for his/her ex and hides it from you? Bad. Cheated upon. Same is the case with your partner. First thing first, be honest about your feelings and tell him how you feel about your ex, so that your partner doesn't blame you for cheating on him/her. Be truthful about everything and seek his help. Do not throw him out of the situation, rather invite him in and ask him to suport you. This way, you both will understand each other more, and will be able to connect on an emotional level. Maybe your partner would have felt the same at some point of time? Sharing only improves the relationship. Being honest about your feelings will give him a sense of security that he is with a right person.Human emotions are complicated. It's not like we fall in love with only one person and stay there for the rest of our lives. Some do. But some don't. People fall in and out of love all the times. They break others' hearts, they get  their hearts broken by others. It's all common and nothing to worry about.

Mehek-Bassi,"I don't know the exact dimensions of your relationship with your female friend, but from the little information you have provided here, I can only conclude that she still might be very hurt to step into another relationship so quickly. Give her some time. Stick with her. Talk to her, mostly listen to what she has to say! Be with her, and support her emotionally right now. Once she understands that you are genuinely there for her, and that you genuinely care, she MIGHT think about a relationship with you if you ask her out again (but only after a few weeks/months! Don't RUSH into it, it will be a definite NO otherwise). And if she says NO, I believe you should STOP running after her. If a girl can't feel anything for you - you can't MAKE HER FEEL anything for you either! Boys are in this WRONG notion, that once a girl is single, they have their chance over her, while it's not so. Girls are emotionally very weak and need a lot of time to move on - IF they were in a serious relationship! And in that case, some girls can even take as long as 5 years to move on (My friend has taken that much time, literally)!!! So it depends upon person to person. You can't guarantee that someone will say yes to you that easily. It might take him a month, or it might be a straight rejection without any future scope for the relationship - you never know!

Mehek-Bassi,"What is a dream? Well its nothing but completion of the sequences from your subconscious mind. Things that were left incomplete, things that were left in the middle, they all stay in our subconscious mind till the time we finish them and then they're erased. Our subconscious mind is 30'000 times stronger than our conscious mind, and everyday we make several incomplete conversations, hundreds of things we want to do but don't, thousands of things we want to say but can't, and when something of prime importance is left incomplete, it is stored in our subconscious mind and the brain completes it in dreams to erase it. Whenever you wake up, you can remember and recall the dream and how it ended, but you can never recall how a dream started. It's true, you can try it! What scene or sequence is going to come in our dreams? That's also the job of our subconscious mind to decide. Like when we see a horror movie before going to sleep, we usually see horror dreams too, because the movie had a great impact on our subconscious mind and it has to play that thing in the dream to get rid of it. If you Google - Lucid Dreaming, you will know that we can control what we dream and we can see dreams of our choices too. It's very difficult to implement that but one of my friends is an expert at Lucid Dreaming! He introduced me to this entire concept of it as well.

You have to wait, be patient, understand, be mature and do everything to keep things smooth. Your partner sitting miles away from you, has no idea what is upsetting you - so be CLEAR about what you feel or what you are going through. Secondly, be in touch as much as you can. We are lucky to be born in an era where social media and technology both have made our lives comfortable. You don't need only handwritten letters to be in touch (although that's an insanely romantic option), but you also have facebook, whatsapp, skype and a lot more to just be as near to your partner as you want to.Sometimes, your partner can be genuinely busy, in that case, try to understand instead of being judgemental and accusing him of cheating on you or ignoring you. He might also miss you as much as you do, but the trick is, to always let him know how much you miss him! Keep texting him whenever you have time, drop in mails and messages for him to read. Record videos and voice messages. In short - just keep the conversation going!Tell him about your day, your new college or office or the new people you meet, new friends you make. Tell him what you are doing and what is keeping you busy. There are innumerable amounts of stuff to talk about. Just don't let the fire go out!Once in a while, also plan out a late-night call or a romantic skype session to keep things normal, since you cannot be physically intimate.

A is just an engineer earning more while B is the CEO of the company earning less than the engineer-A (it's just a hypothetical situation, not real in any way!). B can fire A whenever he wants to, B owns A, but A has nothing in his hand, just his job!Life of A:A has a family and kids, has job satisfaction because the pressure is less and the salary is more. A has a happy life because ultimately all his goals are being fulfilled. He's living a posh life with an ultimate living standard, roaming around in big cars, living in a 5-BHK apartment and his kids go to best schools of the city, they eat good food, wear branded clothes, go to foreign countries on vacations (obviously - more income = more expenses = better lifestyle).Life of B:B has a family and kids, but NO job-satisfaction as there is more pressure and less salary. Doesn't matter what power he has, ultimately it's his company he's running and still not earning enough for his family. His wife quarrels everyday for bringing in less money home, they live a middle-class life despite being owner of the company and having the supreme power in that company! His kids go to mediocre school, his wife wears normal clothes, he goes to office in a regular car, they go on a vacation to Lonavla and Khandala, and at the end of every month, they have to wait for the salary to pay off excess bills!Money, Power, everything is relative. The utmost importance is satisfaction of your inner-self and your family! If you are not happy in your personal life, if you are not happy with your wife/partner or your kids, you can never be happy in your job/workplace, doesn't matter if you are a peon or a president! What drives a human being is not money or power, but emotions and love. If there are no emotions, no love in the life of a person, he can't be happy. He might pretend to be, but there will always be that void, a kind of frustration inside him that will one day burst out like a volcano!Talking about comparing money and power, then BOTH go hand in hand. Any job which is higher in hierarchy will always attract employees ONLY IF there will be a higher salary involved! Now the engineer A, who is already earning good, will never want to become the CEO of the company, because that will include compromising his own lifestyle and living a life lower than the standard he has maintained while in his engineering job! An employee is only driven to go for promotions when there is not only power, but most importantly SALARY-HIKE involved.I hope I made everything clear :)",high,high,high,low,low

Mehek-Bassi,"It dates back to 2009, and till this day I am very sorry and guilty about it. I was in 11th standard back then, and we had tuition classes after school. I used to drive a scooter to my school and then tuition. On the way to the tuition-class, we had a railway-crossing which was closed that day. We were a group of 7 people (all my classmates), and we were waiting for the train to pass by so that we could cross it and attend the class. We were already late enough and our maths teacher was this insane man who wouldn't allow students even if they were only 5 minutes late!We all were shit-scared as only 15 minutes were left for the class to begin, but the train arrived and the crossing was opened for us. We hurriedly tried to cross it, and a few meters ahead, there was a girl on scooter who was driving very slowly, we all were honking at her to give us side, some of my classmates overtook her, but I was stuck behind her because of heavy traffic. Near the turn a few more meters ahead, a guy on the bike was driving really rash and on a completely wrong-side. He didn't care that the girl ahead of me was taking a turn, he just hit her so hard that her scooter skid all around the turn and her head hit the divider of the road. She got up after a minute as she wasn't that badly hurt because she was driving really slow, but the worst thing that happened was - she was wearing a shirt, and most of the front buttons of her shirt were broken because she fell on her face. She realized it only after she gained a little consciousness a minute later and it was so damn embarrassing. The public was passing by her, making lewd gestures and comments at her. She had scratches at her head and elbows, and her shirt was torn up. She was covering her bosom with the torn parts of shirt and crying really badly. I witnessed this all in front of my eyes, but I had no spare clothing to help her. Plus I was so stupid back then, that I just drove ahead without caring what happens to her next.I was ashamed and guilty, but I didn't know what to do as I was scared myself after witnessing this horrible scene! I reached class and was just a minute late. Somehow, the teacher allowed me in, but what happened after that in the class was something that I don't think 100 students in that batch could ever forget!My friend who was driving with me from the school, reached class almost 10 minutes late. Our teacher started shouting at him, NOT for being late, but for coming in shirt-less, in just a vest!Yes, he gave his own shirt to that girl, and was thrown out of the class for this misbehavior. The entire class was laughing but only I knew what actually happened there.PS - That guy is my boyfriend since 5 years now, and one of the major reasons I love him is that he respects women a lot! But I cannot take that incident out of my head even now. I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if it wasn't for him. He helped her, and that gave me a little peace...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"You know who is responsible for all this? - YOU!And you know if you fail your CAT exam, who will be responsible? - YOU!Your girlfriend is a bitch. Sorry to say that, but it's the truth. She can't just be in two relationships, kiss her ex-boyfriend, say sorry to you and then play her emotional card. If there's someone who is the biggest fool here, it's YOU! Can't you see she's using you? If she truly loves you and respects you, she will NEVER even talk to her ex-boyfriend let alone go on a kissing-spree with him. That's insane! And what do you mean by ""She isn't letting you go?"" Is she holding you with a gun pointed at your head? No, right? Then why can't you just leave?If she calls - don't pick it up! Block her number. If she texts - don't reply, block her everywhere! Now the technology gives us so much freedom and so many features to keep the shit out of our lives - why don't you utilize it? Will she come over at your place and press the 'send' button from your mobile to send herself replies to her messages? No, right? Once you block her, you focus on your studies, and stay away from such girls! You can't marry her at all, and you know why? Because even after the marriage, she will keep on kissing her ex-boyfriend and apologize to you for it. Even after you have kids, she will keep on kissing her ex, and what will your children think? What kind of mother they have? So basically when you can't marry her, there's no future of this relationship, and since there is no future of it, there is no use of crying over it or spoiling your present over it!You can choose to either study and crack CAT with a good percentile OR - Give yourself excuses for not studying, tell yourself that you have had a breakup so you need emotional window out of everything, cry in some corner of your house, screw up your CAT exam, and then blame that girl who did NOTHING! Choice is yours - what you want to do. Work hard and crack the exam, or do nothing and put the blame on someone else to give yourself an excuse.Good Luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"I can give you a very real reason - Every year on 01st January, I would make a new-year resolution, and that resolution only worked for one day! The problem with human-beings is that - we are easily distracted! We find something nice to do. We are interested in it as well. We see that we can do it. We are instantly motivated! We want to do it immediately. We make promises and pacts to ourselves, we make resolutions and suddenly, after the day passes, some new thing distracts us and there we go!Every first January resolution was broken on 02nd January, when I would find that the resolution in itself was stupid enough! Like - on one new year, almost 6-7 years back, I made a resolution to hit the gym and reduce weight (I used to be really fat back then), but on 02nd Jan, I thought - Hey, there's entire year to do that! Reducing weight is merely a job of 2-3 months, then why start now? I can start in February when the weather improves a bit! And that's it. The day never came!So, either we are distracted or we think it's too easy and can be done later, basically - laziness! These 2 things are the root cause of 90% of issues today!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"No. It's way more engaging, addictive and crazy than Prison Break and Friends. Breaking bad I've no idea as I haven't seen it. I've seen both PB and Friends, but not even one of them was as madly addictive as GOT. I can give three reasons to prove it - 1. Every week I wait for the episode of GOT, and every season of GOT has only 10 episodes, but in those ten episodes of an hour each, they show content equal to the entire series of any other show. 2. Prison Break was based on Michael Scofield centrally, and Friends was based on a group of six people, but in GOT, you have a whole bunch of characters to choose from. There are so many houses, so many contenders of the king's throne and so much politics. 3. GOT is a very intellectual and intelligent series. Friends is comedy, don't even compare it to GOT as themes of both are highly contrasting. Prison Break is suspense. Both PB and Friends are watchable by PG-13 audiences, but GOT is plain politics and adult series, with so much nudity and showcasing the true face of prostitution and sexuality. And in GOT, you never know who's going to die next!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Expectations!If you are living alone in a jungle, surrounded by food and water and basic necessities, there won't be any stress because you are eating well, you are living well and you are happy at the end of the day! But imagine, now there's a neighbour who joins you in jungle. He has a rolex watch and uses fancy Apple MacBook Pro to connect with the world. Suddenly, your life is a shit-hole and you want Rolex and MacBook as well! You don't care whether you are eating well and happy in your life, now everything revolves around MacBook and Rolex. You don't need them, but you 'want' them, and this gap between need and want is bridged by expectations which cause stress and tension.For a moment, forget everything and just look around you. Right now you are either staring into a Laptop screen or a PC screen or a Mobile screen, that means you have enough resources to get any of these devices and an internet connection too! Right now, you have a comfortable bed or chair to sit upon, you are sitting in an Air conditioned or well warmed room, you have enough money to buy food and travel conveniently. You can read these words, understand them, that means you are a literate, and someone made efforts to enrol you through school and pay for your education. Right now you have everything you need. Are you happy now? Yes. At least you are happier than what you were before you started reading my answer there.So that is basically, a reason for stress and tension!

Mehek-Bassi,"She's a type of girl who just wants to mess up with your mind, play with your feelings, make you run after her first, and then say 'Sorry brother, I am not interested, maine to tumko us nazar se kabhi dekha hi nahi tha...blah blah blah and all the crazy shit!'I know these type of girls. First they notice if someone is giving them attention. If someone is giving them any attention, then they will befriend that person and later on ditch him so that he cries for them, he runs after them, and is frustrated to such an extent that he ends up proposing them and listening to a 'no'. And when the poor guy finally begins to move on, they notice that now the attention that they received has reduced, so they again start playing the game!If you don't believe me, you can give it another shot. Hey, why just one? Try this for at-least 3-4 times and you will understand the category of such girls! She will never say yes to you, but wants you to run after her! She does this so she can keep a count of, you know ""How many guys proposed to me in my life. OMG I'm so hot, I am so adorable, I am so wanted...blah blah blah..."" What they don't understand is - They are nothing but cheapsters who believe in use-and-throw theory.I would advice you to just focus on your job and keep on working hard, get promotions, get a salary hike, try for on-site opportunity, try new things, indulge into new experiences of life, just keep all this bullshit away and enjoy life as it comes!

Mehek-Bassi,"You are NOT under-performing!Well, before I give you a solution, I want you to have a glance at my life, which is very much similar to yours - In 2011 I passed out 12th, got into BSc, after 3 months, I realized that it wasn't my cup of tea, so I dropped out and started preparing for IIT/AIEEE (it was my first attempt as in 2011, I hadn't appeared in exams). But due to lack of preparation, lack of attention, lack of every-damn-thing, I couldn't clear IIT. I cleared AIEEE though, but with a very mediocre rank (40K). In 2012, I had to settle for 3-tier local engineering college, and now I am in final year in CSE. The people who were with me in school, are already in their jobs! In 2nd year, I published a book which gave me title of an author! Now I am in final year and placed in two companies with package around (3.5 - 4), which is same as yours, but inside, I feel that I could have cleared IIT had I been a little more attentive, but then, I am NOT an under-performer, because if I had cleared IIT, I might not have written books! More of my books are coming in future years, and I believe that I came into this college because my life had something else planned for me!Coming to your situation now:You achieved a lot of things! Let me tell you, what has happened has happened, and you cannot go back in the past and change it. Believe me, I tried a lot, but nothing happened! :PSo, you have to settle for what you have, and earning 24K at your age (when half of the country's graduates are unemployed, and commerce people don't even get placed after college! PhDs in UP are applying for job of Peon!), earning 24K at your age is damn good! Ultimately it doesn't matter from which college you graduate, or with how many marks you pass out, because graduates from NITs & 1-tier colleges also land into same companies, as us, and what matters is - how you perform once you are IN the company! What is giving you tension right now - won't even matter 10 years from now!Want to see a picture of your future? Read ahead -You will be working in an awesome MNC with a salary of around 25L per annum. Married to a gorgeous woman, have kids, and have a satisfactory life in one of the top cities of the country. Your scores, college, intoxication, bad grades, regrets - nothing will matter! Only one thing will matter and that is - how happy you are at that moment!All this can happen, if you shun the negative thoughts and start being happy in what you have. Doesn't matter if you are starting from 24K, reaching 2L per month isn't a tough job if you are focused and hard-working! And all your regrets will be long gone by then. However, if you want to sit, cry and regret, and give yourself excuses for not working enough right now, you might be sitting at 50K per month salary even after 10 years! And you don't want that, do you?If you seriously want your future to be good, stop blaming the past and work in the present. We can give whatever amount of excuses to ourselves for not working enough! But at the end, successful is the one who puts in right amount of effort, at right amount of time, and not sit and regret. I hope after reading this, you will work hard, study more courses side by side, polish your skills that are required in IT, prepare for interviews when you are planning to switch the company so that you get a good hike, and ultimately, stop blaming yourself and your past for everything!We all make mistakes. We all are imperfect. What makes us perfect is our dedication to improve ourselves!Good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"BE YOURSELF!Girls like men who are confident and who aren't afraid of the challenges in life. Doesn't matter if you are in engineering and have few girls in your branch. Right now you should just focus on making your career and not think about a wife, because a wife will come ONLY when you will have a stable career, so you get my point? Career > Wife.However, if you are successful and have a good sense of humour, your wife will never regret being with you!Past is past. Doesn't matter if your wife has boyfriends before or she went through relationships and even had a good time, what matters is the present and how happy can you keep her! Relationships are not like corporate jobs where experience matters. In relationships, even a fresher can perform better than the experienced ones! As long as you give freedom to your wife, you don't restrict her, you don't nag her, you don't argue with her on stupid things, you love and care for her and you support her decisions, I don't think there will be any problem. As of now, you should just focus on your studies or job or career or whatever trade you are in and I believe everything will be just fine! :) Good luck!",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"She says I'm her first priority and he is just another guy. She said she can't forget me and can't sleep after fighting with me.If she is so much into you, then why is she not ready to leave the other guy even if you have asked her to choose one? That's ridiculous! She is contradicting her own statements! Since you are not her boyfriend yet, so asking her to choose one can even result in permanent good-byes, but she won't do that (since she said all that above). And if she really cares about you, she will listen to you and at least pay attention to what you are saying, if the other guy isn't good, she has to trust you on that because she can't judge it on her own. The other guy will never behave in any wrong way in front of her, so she will always think that you are lying or something. She has to either trust you on that, or she will learn the hard way, when that other guy betrays her trust and hurt her. You can only hope that she listens to you!You cannot take out anyone of the picture because, this is LIFE. It doesn't work the way you want. You can only hope that nothing wrong happens, and that your friend isn't hurt. Only she can decide whether to continue her contacts with him or not, you can't decide that for her, unless she really respects you and obeys you, till then - keep hoping that things turn out the way you want them to! :) Good luck!",high,high,high,low,low

He is also that sweet innocent boy who never passes any comments, feels bad for girls who are cheated upon by other guys, has a soft and delicate heart and always wants to contribute into good things! He also never approached a girl, I asked him out (YES!).But even after these repulsive thoughts, we came into a relationship, and since that day I have never looked at any other guy. That is how much I love him. I respect him and I genuinely know that he is the guy for me. Don't worry, some day you will also get some girl who will respect you genuinely, care for you and love you, and that day you will have all the answers to your questions. Just be confident, don't think you are a loser, rather you are a winner, for being so nice in a world of assholes! The guys who cheat girls, get slutty wives :P This is not a joke, it's Karma, who returns them their share of the shit back! So, if you have never spread shit, you won't get back any. Just be the way you are, and I am sure one day that special someone will come finding you and then you will know why it took so long, because the best things are always worth the wait :) Remember - The longer you wait, the hotter you date!

Mehek-Bassi,"ME!Well, to be honest my love story isn't a great one, neither it is a legendary one. It's just an ordinary one with bits of emotions and feelings and a lot of ups and downs. So, I started dating this wonderful guy with an awesome sense of humour. He was my classmate back in school, and as soon as we passed 12th board exams, I asked him out (YES!). But fate had something else in store for us, as soon as we came in a relationship, his family relocated. We were thrown miles apart and into a long distance relationship. I didn't know him that well, neither did he. We hadn't met more than 2 times. We were both kids, and handling a relationship, that too a long distance one despite having no idea on how to trust each other - was a damn tough thing, but we stuck along.Sometimes he would come to meet me too, and the maximum we have met is 4 times in one year. Just like that 4 years passed by. His engineering completed and he went for a job in Mumbai and we were dragged into even farther long distance relationship. Earlier when he was in Chandigarh, he came 4 times a year, but now we don't get to see each other at all. It is difficult, but we stuck along.He might not be present with me physically, but his emotional support was always there. He is still just a call away, and for me that is enough, because sometimes the couples are sitting next to each other, but can't share their feelings. And the bond I have with my guy is incredible despite being in a long distance relationship for five years. Despite having spent no time together at all. I can talk my heart out to him on phone, I can say whatever I want to and same is the case with him. We both don't hide anything from each other and the trust that we have formed, didn't come easy either. We had our fights, we had our differences, but in the end, we stuck along.In the past 5 years, I published 2 books, he completed his engineering and got into his dream company. It's not like we didn't plan our future or didn't work for it, but we never left each other, because we had made a vow - to stick along...",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"It's very bad to know that he lied and betrayed you, but you should be thankful that you were in it only for 1.5 yrs! That's not a long time. There are people whose marriages are based upon lies, and they can't catch it for as long as decades. This relationship must have taught you to never trust a person in your life that easily. And that is a lesson that most of us learn after going through a lot of shit, just like you did. But now think - Is there any use of demanding answers now?Is there any use of living in past and cursing whatever happened?Will crying bring back your 1.5 years?Will repenting, make things okay?Nothing will help, but only one thing - MOVING ON!Move on and screw the past. It's anyways behind you, don't bring it up again and again and ruin your present because anyways you've wasted a lot of time on that man. Demanding answers won't do any good. You will ask him why did he lie, and he will blatantly say - It was Fun! Then what? You will cry and curse yourself for trusting him. And you will not eat for a day or two. But eventually, you have to LIVE and you have to be normal some-day, then why not today? :)Stop thinking about what happened, and start thinking about what you want to do with your future and what you really expect from yourself as a person.

Mehek-Bassi,"Okay, you want to hear something HONEST? Here it is: After a decade, you will REGRET!Now coming to your problem (which is problem of half the country right now). Kids getting into relationship with the people who love them, but parents finding caste and state into it. The first thing you should do is - STAND for your love! Your partner is NOT the only one in the relationship, you are there too, and it's time you show your presence so fight for it. Nothing comes for free in this life, girl. You have to fight for some things, and believe me, the things that are really good and worth in life, can only be achieved only after a fierce fight! Don't think that everything will come to you and you will just sit on a comfortable couch, that is not going to happen.Secondly, CONVINCE your parents. They are your parents so it's your duty to convince them. If you really love the guy, and you know he will keep you happy, can't you show this thing to your parents? I'm sure they want your happiness above everything else. They just can't realize this thing right now, but if you try to talk to them, they will realize and eventually support you too!Tell your parents the following things:What if the guy they have found for you (same caste guy) comes out to be a jerk in future?How are they sure that he will keep you happy? Happier than the guy who already loves you and wants you in his life?How can they guarantee that only a guy of their caste can keep you satisfied in life? What if the same-caste guy beats you tomorrow? Who will support you then? At least the guy who loves you, will respect you and value you enough because only he knows with how much difficulty he has got you. This thing can never be felt by the same-caste guy who just got your alliance through a family-friend!If it's about finances - tell your parents - How can they say that the same-caste guy will remain rich forever and how can they be sure that your love can't ever get rich? What if the same-caste guy comes on streets tomorrow and the guy you love becomes a millionaire? Who will repent then?What if the same-caste guy and his family don't love you at all? They don't support you, they don't treat you as their own? It's YOU who has to leave your home and go live with someone else's family, and not your parents, so 99% the decision should be yours!There are a million points you can come up with, only if you really want your own happiness and you don't want to ditch and cheat and spoil the life of an innocent guy who loved you honestly and with all his heart. If you get married to the same-caste guy over your boyfriend, you will contribute towards the hatred guys have for girls! That is the reason all the sad songs are written, and that is the reason guys can't trust girls. Because of some girls who think like you at the decision time, innocent girls suffer.I hope you will take the correct decision, good luck :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"To be honest, the scene of Mechanical Engineering in the country right now (2015) is pitiable! There are ME graduates from my college who are not getting any good jobs, the jobs that are available for them are either low-paying or in a stagnant department or are simply pathetic, that after a week only, they want to resign!But see, this is NOT the end of life. Making a career is something which is entirely your choice as you have to decide what you want to do in life. Sort out the things that you are passionate about, things that you want to do in life, and things that you are good at. Then decide whether you want to do this boring job for the rest of your life, or take a risk?Those who are full of fear get nowhere. For a life of your dreams, you have to take risks, that is the only option. Stop thinking about family/society for a minute because at the end, its not them but YOU who has to do a job! They just want results, nothing else, they don't care if you are happy or not as long as you are earning, and money is not a big issue if you are working in a field of your interest! Take a risk - what will happen? What can happen to the extremes? You will fail, right? Are you afraid of failure? Will life end at the failure? NO! Then why not try it? How can you even know that you will fail WITHOUT trying it? So first, try something new, go for what your heart says, and do it.I won't say resign your job right now, but try for other companies, other posts, give interviews, prepare for tests and exams, shortlist what you want to do and just DO IT! Don't think about what 'ABC' person will think about you, let him think whatever he wants to because at the end, this life is YOURS and you have to live it, you have to work in it, you have to survive.

They will lose someone who called them mom and dad and that is a terrible feeling! You die today and you kill your friends/relatives/people who love you because of your stupid SOLVABLE issues you are going to murder a lot of people, and believe me, you don't want that!If you seriously want to IMPROVE your life, SHUN the thoughts about suicide and killing yourself, because that is cowardice! All the great men are made through the challenges and not through easy routes. All the people we remember today with pride, had their moments with tough life, but did they give up? Had they given up, would we be living in a world, where we are living now? NO!So, just stop thinking about suicide and start working. Do something you are good at, something you want. You want to paint? Dance? Sing? Play instruments? Play sports? Cricket? Football? Play Counter Strike? Do you want to write books? Read books? Read about the world? Read about inspirations? GO DO IT! Don't sit here listening to sad songs and surfing Google about best ways to die, because that will do nothing, just make you more miserable and you will feel shitty, but at the end you will come here to Quora, write about your life's miseries and expect an answer. So here it is. The answer to your non-existent problem!I call it non-existent you know why? Because your problem isn't even visible compared to the genuine problems the world is facing. You are sitting in a comfortable room and having an internet connection, along with a mobile phone or a laptop from where you post questions on Quora. You are having knowledge, you are literate, you can read and write, and you still want to end your life?Think about the people who don't have food to eat, home to live, water to drink, and they are so damn passionate about living, bringing a change. It's shame that you, despite having so much, are doing nothing but Googling ways to end your life!So shut this nonsense, and go WORK!

Mehek-Bassi,"Confusion = NOT GOODFirst thing - Confusion in a relationship, especially related to 'love' is never good! If your GF says she is confused between you and her 'ex', time to sit down and talk things out.Ask her if she is in love with her 'ex' and then breakup, because being in a loveless relationship is like being in a roofless house! You can never feel protected or secure in a bad weather! If she says she loves you, then ask her how you feel when she brings her 'ex' in between. Tell her 'what if you do the same? How will she feel?'Feeling jealous and insecure is one thing, but making someone feel jealous or insecure is a terrible thing. Know if your girlfriend is deliberately doing this to get your attention. Ask her what her problem is? Whether she is actually having feelings for her ex or just trying to get your attention, and in the latter case, ask her what she wants - more dates? Frequent meetings? Making-out? WHAT EXACTLY?If your girlfriend is not interested in you and still involved with her 'ex', I Say do 2 things - Talk about breaking-up. I am not asking you to just go and breakup, but tell her that you can't live like this. You can't live this comparative life, and see what she has to say!If she doesn't want to breakup, give her an ultimatum and tell her that you cannot take this comparison anymore.

What if nobody loves you or cares about you? What will happen? What can MAXIMUM happen? Let's take a look at the following points -If you speak something you shouldn't have spoken - what can someone do 'maximum?' Kill you? NO! They can't! Hit you? NO THEY CAN'T do even that! Then what? Maximum what will happen? Think? The answer is - they will say a few words back to you and walk away! This is maximum that can happen, and are you afraid of words? Really?If people don't like you. Let's assume nobody on this entire planet likes you or cares about you, what can 'maximum' happen? Are people helping you even now? Do they pay your bills or do they lend you money? How is their opinion even important? What if they hate you? You know what maximum can happen? They will talk shit behind your back. ""BACK""! Such people don't have audacity to say things to your face, that's how coward they are! And you are afraid of things being said behind your back? Ask yourself are you really that afraid?If someone thinks you are nerd/rude/anti-social. Let's assume entire world thinks that! What can happen? Will they kill you? NO! Will they hit you? NO! Will they talk about you? YES! Will they ever say things to your face? NO! Will they talk behind your back and be sweet at your face? YES! Then what are you afraid of?

I scored 96% in my tenth standard, and that too - way back in 2009 - when getting high percentages wasn't even that common, so don't think it's something that makes you smart. A piece of paper can't make you smart! I was a 96% scorer and still dumb. But what made me smart isn't my score card or board result, it's the experience I gained by meeting new people, getting ditched by my own friends, having random experiences in life! Exposing myself to a lot of things during the 4 years of my college - basically I love studying human-psychology and that really helped me understanding people, and what someone really wants from you - and believe me when I say that if someone has negative thoughts about you - chances are s/he will NEVER say that to your face, it's all 'behind the back' talk, that happens, and I don't think it's so important that one should really waste his/her time on it. You have BETTER things to do in life, man! There are so many hate-mails and messages that I get everyday from people. There is so much negativity that I have to handle, but if I will keep crying/whining about them all day, I won't be able to do what I do the best - write and work on my projects! I will just keep crying in some corner of my room everyday, and that's not going to help me in any way. So why waste your time? Someone is barking against you - let them bark! If I put you in my life, and ask you to just ""read"" the messages in my ""Others"" folder on Facebook - you can end up killing yourself! But if I kill myself, will that solve my problems? No! For solving problems, I need to be headstrong, and face them. Face the people, and shut their mouths with my work, and not with my words! My words won't make that deep of an impact as my work will, and someday, when I will be capable and worthy enough to shut their mouths - they will get all the answers!Missing social events isn't cool! You need to be normal, and for that you need to shed your fear first! Put on earphones, play your favorite song, and dance in the streets - can you do that? Do that once, and I bet you will never be afraid of anything in life anymore! Your all fears will go away like a joke. Meet new people, make new friends and hang out. Go to parties, be more social, plan get-together with your school friends, plan trips and tours with your college mates, basically - do anything to involve yourself into a social-circle more, so that you can shed all your fears and the negativity inside you. It's the easiest one can do in college life, after that this thing becomes more and more dominant on you, and it ends up becoming your habit, you will forever be afraid of these stupid things - doesn't matter if you work, get married and have kids - the fears won't go away!Good Luck! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"What you suffer from is 'anxiety' - the fear of new things, and trying new things with a fear of failing at them. The biggest issue is - ""what will people think of me?"" ""Am I good enough?"" ""Will they judge me?"" ""What will girls think of me?"" ""What if I fail to transact money on this ATM, will the people behind me kill me?""The solution is - Taking time off all the mental thoughts, and relaxing! Go out for sometime, where you don't think about these things. Stop giving any thought to what people think of you and stop worrying about making everyone happy. Let's for once face this fact that we can't make everyone happy on this planet and neither are we here to do that! Our job is to do what we love, spend our life in happiness, and not in worrying about other's happiness - if we are not happy inside, how can we make someone else happy? All these thoughts sound very good when we are reading, and subconsciously we make a plan to execute them as well, and we start working on it too! But at the end, when the conviction starts drying off, we are again back on square one, and we again think we can't do it. We need a constant push, and that push comes from within. I and anyone for that matter can only advice you for time being - if there is someone who can do it - it's YOU!So, Stop thinking about stupid things that pull you down. Start wearing earphones more often, play music and dance on your tunes without worrying what anyone will think of you, and see the difference! Good Luck! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Mehek-Bassi,"Things to avoid on your date with your special girl -Well for starters, you can offer to pay the bill, because that is what all girls would want on a first date!You can crack some good jokes, make her laugh. Get her comfortable, talk to her, but most importantly, listen to her. Girls love to talk, and they love someone who can listen! But if your girl is a shy-girl, don't force her to talk, you can talk and make her comfortable that way.Talk about light-stuff, don't start arguing over political views or religious shit, this just fucks up the date (Happened with me once, and I literally walked out of the restaurant before the food arrived!)Don't talk about your previous relationships, don't talk about personal problems, or family issues, just keep it light, simple and good!Always pull out the chair for the lady. This point is supposed to go all the way up there ^ but I missed it. Always open the car door, if you are taking her in your car, and if not, you can show the courtesy by pulling out a chair. It makes a darn-good impression! She will know that she is with a gentleman.Never talk rudely with the waiter, because that marks a bad impression. Always talk politely to the waiter, if you have to call him, call politely, call him 'Sir', that won't make you small, and tip good. The most important part of the date is the bill - you will obviously pay the bill of the food that you have eaten, but how much you tip is what shows your character. If you are eating for Rs 1500, Rs 100 won't burn your pocket! The tip in the USA is always more than 15% of the bill, but we don't have any such provision in India, but you can make a change by showing your big-heart and a good character just by paying a good amount of tip to the waiter. The girl will think you are NOT a miser or a money-minded person!Follow these points, and I guess you are good to go. All the best! :)",high,high,high,low,low
Aniket-Kushare,"Researchers believe this may explain why people living in India and Mexico, who eat a spicy diet, tend to have lower rates of some cancers than those eating a bland Western diet. Peppery foods are also believed to stimulate the appetite by setting off the flow of saliva and gastric juices, a nutritionally important effect for people in tropical areas where the oppressive heat acts as an appetite suppressant. And, an tally at least, they act as an overall stimulant, producing a titillating, awakening effect and increasing the acuity of the senses.“Chili is a guilt-free way to make food more flavourful, interesting and exciting.” says Dr. Susan.A huge fan of hot food, Dr. Susan Biali, a Vancouver general practitioner with a degree in dietetics. “Chilies add wonderful flavour and kick to foods, and have very few calories,” says Biali, who has been gradually adding more heat to her diet for years, and jokes that she can even out-chili her Mexican husband, who grew up on spicy food.It is a long-standing myth that spicy food exacerbates ulcers and other stomach ailments. But research shows hot chili peppers actually protect the stomach lining and may prevent the gastric damage associated with anti-inflammatory painkillers.Chilies are high in nutrients such as calcium plus vitamins A and C, and there’s some evidence that hot chilies can reduce cardiovascular disease risk, help prevent diabetes and boost metabolism. They may also have some ability to prevent cancer.Recent research tells us that hot chili peppers are an up-and-coming health power. A laboratory study in the United Kingdom, for instance, found that 'Capsaicin', which is responsible for the burning sensation chilies provide, can kill lung and pancreatic cancer cells without harming the surrounding cells.One discovered that adding chilies to meals may protect against the buildup of cholesterol in the blood. Another found that regularly eating hot chilies reduces insulin requirements, which may have implications in the prevention and treatment of diabetes.Everyone loves a little spice now and then in their meals. Not only does it thrill the taste buds, but also makes food more palatable.But the fun of eating it apart, there are health benefits of tucking into food that might make you cry. Here are some of them...1. Weight loss: For one, that extra spice can also cause you to lose the flab. As per research, chillies have capsaicin, a compound that gives a thermogenic effect and thus makes the body to burn more calories after you have had the meal.2. Better heart health: Chillies are also known to reduce cardiovascular risk. They lower incidences of heart attack and stroke as hot chillies lessen damaging effects of LDL (bad cholesterol). Capsaicin is also said to help fight inflammation, which is a major factor in heart problems.3. Lower blood pressure: A study has shown that a compound in chillies has the ability to lower blood pressure. It also was shown to induce blood vessels to relax.4. Reduces anger levels: Spicy foods boost production of feel-good hormones, such as serotonin. So they may help ease depression and stress.5. Reduce Your Risk of Tumors: Capsaicin has been shown to activate cell receptors in your intestinal lining, creating a reaction that lowers the risk of tumors.6. Improve Your Sex Life: In a review of purported aphrodisiacs, both ginseng and saffron were found to boost sexual performance.Sources:Why spicy food is good for you & The Times of India",mid,mid,mid,low,low

Take a harder look before you scroll down to find the answer. !!Napoleon liked violets from his youth till his death where he was wearing a locket around his neck which contained violets. The scent of violets was the favorite fragrance of his first wife, Josephine. She also wore violets on her wedding day and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets every year on the anniversary of their marriage.During the time he was in exile, there were hundreds of toasts made in France to the health and well-being of ""Caporal La Violette"". Ladies who supported Bonaparte wore purple violets in their hair or on their bonnets. Others trimmed their bonnets or even their gowns with violet-colored ribbons, or wore violet ribbons in their hair.Violets also began to appear on jewelry as well. The most common were rings which displayed a small enamel violet on the bezel. However, there were also broaches, pendants and earrings which were fashioned in the shape of the delicate violet flower for those who wished to quietly but elegantly demonstrate their loyalty to the exiled emperor.Further Details on Corporal Violet",mid,mid,mid,low,low

Rowling also released a short history of the Potter family tree, titled ""The Potter Family."" Dating back to the 12th century, it's sure to satisfy even the most loyal Potterhead.- Fleamont Potter and his wife, Euphemia, are the parents of James Potter, Harry's dad. Unfortunately, both Fleamont and Euphemia died of dragon pox before Harry was born. They never got the chance to meet their grandson.- Fleamont Potter, Henry Potter's son, was quite gifted at wizard dueling. ""He [Fleamont] always attributed his dexterity at dueling to the number of times he had to fight people at Hogwarts after they had made fun of his name,"" Rowling explains. Like his ancestor Linfred of Stinchcombe, Fleamont Potter was also well known for inventing a potion. He's the mastermind behind ""Sleekeazy's Hair Potion,"" which fans might remember Hermione using to tame her hair for the Yule Ball. He later sold the Sleekeazy company for quite a profit, solidifying the Potter family fortune, Rowling explains.- Rowling finally explains the origins of all the bronze knuts and gold galleons Harry inherited. ""The Potters continued to marry their neighbours, occasionally Muggles, and to live in the West of England, for several generations, each one adding to the family coffers by their hard work,"" Rowling explained.- Linfred's daughter-in-law, Iolanthe Peverell of Godric's Hollow, brought the invisibility cloak into the Potter family line. Her grandfather, Ignotus Peverell, was the cloak's original owner, which was referenced in ""Tale of the Three Brothers,"" where Peverell was gifted the cloak for outsmarting death.- Never fear, the Potter family history is still ""illustrious"" thanks to their connection to the ""Deathly Hallows,"" the three legendary magical objects which make a person the master of death.Find more on Pottermore.",mid,mid,mid,low,low

His designed car appears to be the Tesla’s identical twin. The body and interior are lifted directly from a Model S with some styling cues cribbed from Lexus, Audi, and Maserati. The wheelbase, door pillars, and interior details, including all instrumentation, seem identical to the S.The Le* Car Case:The Tesla clone that is almost past the concept stage is ""Le* Car"". It is a side project of LeTV, a wildly successful streaming subscription service that Bloomberg News called “the Chinese Netflix.” It was conceived by Jia Yueting, the billionaire behind China’s top-selling smart TV and a phone that sold 200,000 units in the first few seconds of its release. Le* Car is perhaps best described as a Model S with European hypercar styling, planned for a debut at the Beijing auto show in April 2016.In August, Yueting cashed out $1.2 billion worth of stock in his company, then loaned the money to LeTV, presumably to put the car on a fast-track. Production is slated to begin in early 2018.Pic: This is the interior of the Ranger X that looks just like that of the Tesla, right down to the massive touchscreenThe Thunder Power CaseThis is the Thunder Power EV, a Taiwanese car with strong notes of Tesla design.

Aniket-Kushare,"Margaret Hamilton invented the modern concept of software and helped men land on the moon! This was a decade before Microsoft and nearly 50 years before Marc Andreessen (cofounder of Netscape) would observe that software is “eating the world.” It was 1960, not a time when women were encouraged to seek out high-powered technical work. Hamilton, a 24-year-old with an undergrad degree in mathematics, had gotten a job as a programmer at MIT. The plan was for her to support her husband through his three-year stint at Harvard Law.But the Apollo space program came along. And Hamilton stayed in the lab to lead an epic feat of engineering that would help change the future.For Hamilton, programming meant punching holes in stacks of punch cards, which would be processed overnight in batches on a giant Honeywell mainframe computer that simulated the Apollo lander’s work. It would be shipped off to a nearby Raytheon facility where a group of women worked on threaded copper wires through magnetic rings (a wire going through a core was a 1; a wire going around the core was a 0). Forget about RAM or disk drives; on Apollo, memory was literally hardwired and very nearly indestructible.As a working mother in the 1960s, Hamilton was unusual, but as a spaceship programmer, Hamilton was positively radical. Hamilton would bring her daughter Lauren by the lab on weekends and evenings. While 4-year-old Lauren slept on the floor of the office.She simply loved the arcane novelty of her job and incessantly kept creating routines that would ultimately be added to the Apollo’s command module computer.At the MIT Instrumentation Lab where Hamilton worked, she and her colleagues were inventing core ideas in computer programming as they wrote the code for the world’s first portable computer. In 1965, Hamilton became responsible for the onboard flight software on the Apollo computers.It was an exciting time, and the US was depending on the work that she was doing. But sometimes the pressure kept Hamilton up at night. Once, after a late-night party, she rushed back to the computer lab to correct a piece of code she’d suddenly realized was flawed. “I was always imagining headlines in the newspapers, and they would point back to how it happened, and it would point back to me.” says Hamilton.By mid-1968, more than 400 people were working on Apollo’s software, because software was how the US was going to win the race to the moon. As it turned out, of course, software was going to help the world do so much more.Apollo flights carried two near-identical machines: one used in the lunar module—the Eagle that landed on the moon—and the other for the command module that carried the astronauts to and from Earth.Hamilton has long moved on from NASA and the Apollo program. Today her company, Hamilton Technologies, is just a few blocks away from MIT, where her career began—a hub of the code revolution that’s still looking toward the stars.Get the complete article by Robert McMillan.",mid,mid,mid,low,low

Aniket-Kushare,"Personally I find bliss at places that are quiet and peaceful.Unlike many answers here, I will thus mention the least explored beaches in Goa.1. Cola BeachEven locals, who don’t live nearby, have never heard of this beach before. To get to this hidden treasure travel south to Canacona and then look around for the signs that will lead you to an immaculately spotless beach pictured against a flawless backdrop of coconut groves and blue skies. It’s only five minutes away from Agonda beach and has a unique lagoon surrounded by beach huts where you can stay overnight. Photo credit: Alli Khan / Panoramio2. Butterfly Beach This exquisite gem not only has a pretty name but is a relatively unexplored stretch of sand because of its isolation. It’s located on Butterfly Island and is a great place if you’re looking for total privacy. The only way to reach Butterfly Island’s beautiful beach is by boat from Agonda or Palolem beach. Photo credit: www.tourmet.com 3. Kakolem BeachIf you’re really up for an adventure try getting to this little-known beach, also known as Tiger beach. Located in a bay, its breathtaking beauty makes up for almost getting lost on the way there. The sands are clean and deserted. The only way by land is to take the NH66 highway towards Cola village. Turn north-east and drive on a broken old road which will lead you to a small platform. Take the narrow steep winding stone stairs leading down to the beach. A much easier way to get there is by renting a boat to transport you there and back. Photo credit: www.thegoavilla.com 4. Hollant BeachThis serene beach has a lovely bay with a long stretch of shallow water running into the sea that is perfect for non-swimmers and waders. The beach is rocky but the picturesque bay makes up for it. You’ll even see fishermen’s boats lining the narrow, curving shore to create a quaint picture.  Photo credit: www.beachesingoa.com 5. Betul BeachThe wide expanse of this compact sandy beach can be found about 18kms from Margao. The scenery will remind you of traditional coastal fishing villages. It even has a small lagoon and a 17th century fort nearby. Get to Mobor beach by land and then take the Cavelossim-Assolna ferry across the River Sal to the beach.  Photo credit: www.thegoavilla.com 6. Velsao BeachJust north of the popular Majorda and Colva beaches in the southern part of Goa is this stunning beach with soft, silvery sand and nothing but a lifeguard and some birds to keep you company. You’ll spot a few swimmers here but like you they’re there to escape the crowds of more popular beaches nearby. Photo credit: Rajeev Naique / Panoramio7. Siridao BeachAbout 12kms south of Panjim near the Zuari river estuary is this beach with scattered blocks of rock in between smooth strips of sand giving the beachscape an unusually rugged appearance. Another unique quality about this beach is the fragments of oyster shells that wash up on the shore and brighten up the beach. The Chapel of Jesus of Nazareth is the nearest landmark.

Aniket-Kushare,"Vitamin D may be known as the sunshine vitamin, but according to a new survey by Prevention and supplement company Centrum, few of us think to look for it in the fridge—and that's a big mistake.""The sun is not strong enough for the body to make vitamin D from October to May, especially for those living north of Atlanta,"" says Althea Zanecosky, RD, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. That's probably why nearly half of people tested at winter's end were low on vitamin D, according to a University of Maine study.Compounding the problem is our vigilant use of sunscreen; SPF 15 blocks 93% of UVB rays, the type our bodies use to make D. Skin also has a harder time producing vitamin D with age. All this adds up to a big problem, as evidence continues to mount that the vitamin, long associated with bone health, also helps to regulate the immune system, lower blood pressure, protect against depression, and reduce risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and several kinds of cancer. A 2014 study from the University of California-San Diego School of Medicine also found that people with low vitamin D levels were twice as likely to die prematurely.So are you getting enough D? Probably not. The Institute of Medicine has set the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of vitamin D at 600 international units (IU) for everyone under the age of 70. (It's 800 IU for adults 70+.) But many experts believe that's too low. ""There is talk that the RDA may be increased,"" says Zanecosky. ""Many physicians are now advising 2,000 mg daily for those with low blood levels.""Many respondents in the Prevention and Centrum recent nutrient survey were rightfully concerned they weren't getting enough D, with 22% actively looking for it in foods. But just 9% knew that salmon is a good natural source of the vitamin, and only 5% recognized fortified tofu as one, too. Here are some other ways to get more in your diet:Natural SourcesWild-caught fish (425 IU in 3 oz salmon, 547 IU in 3 oz mackerel)Beef or calf liver (42 IU in 3 oz)Egg yolks (41 IU per egg)Canned fish (154 IU in 3 oz tuna, 270 IU in 3.5 oz sardines)Shiitake mushrooms (40 IU in 1 cup)Fortified Sources (Note: Not all brands are vitamin-D fortified, so read labels carefully.)Milk: whole, nonfat or reduced fat (100 IU in 8 oz)Yogurt (80–100 IUs in 6 oz)Almond milk (100 IU in 8 oz)Pudding made with milk (49-60 IUs in ½ cup)Orange juice (137 IU in 1 cup)Breakfast cereals (50–100 IUs in 0.75–1 cup)Fortified tofu (80 IU in 3 oz)Oatmeal (150 IU in 1 packet)Cheese (40 IU in 1 slice)Eggnog (123 IU in 8 ozMargarine (25 IU in 1 teaspoon)",mid,mid,mid,low,low
Aniket-Kushare,"Walking is effective enough to maintain weight and control pain from chronic disease. It is recommended that adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week as well as two days of resistance training. A survey found that an overwhelming majority of people don't meet these benchmarks. To help you get into the swing of walking, we've rounded up seven reasons why you should take up walking as an exercise...It is linked to lower rates of obesityPeople, who walk to work are less likely to be obese, according to a study. Walking just 20 minutes a day can reduce your risk of premature death by 30%. About 30 minutes of walking a day burns 150 calories, which can help you reach a calorie deficit that leads to weight loss.Walking helps prevent diabetesWalking regulates blood sugar levels, which keeps insulin levels low and diabetes at bay. Walking for 15 minutes after meals helped regulate blood sugar levels just as effectively as one 45-minute walk per day, said a study, which is good for those daunted by one big walking session.It is a good form of exercise for your heartEveryone knows that in the ranking of best-for-you exercises, running is better than walking, right? Not necessarily, and especially not when it comes to cardiovascular health. A study found that walkers who cover the same mileage as runners enjoy comparable reductions in high blood pressure, high cholesterol and coronary heart disease. While it took twice as long for walkers to cover the distance, walking may be a more sustainable and accessible activity than running for most people, especially those who are new to exercise.Walking is gentle enough for people of all body typesPregnant? Morbidly obese? Arthritic? Walking is gentle enough for most people who have these conditions, doctors agree, and the activity can help ease the pain of chronic illness — even if you have to start off by walking just two minutes a day.It lifts your mood and protects against depression and anxietyMoving your body is a good way to release endorphins, a set of feel-good chemicals that dull pain receptors in the brain, sedate you and even give you feelings of happiness and euphoria. That's why walking is recommended to help improve symptoms of mild to moderate depression. Walking briskly for 35 minutes five times a week, or 60 minutes three times a week, has a significant influence on mild to moderate depression symptoms.It'll help you sleep better at nightThere's a reason that travel experts advise you to walk around a new city on the day you arrive. Exposing your body to sunlight and staying outside helps recalibrate the hormone melatonin to your new surroundings and time zone. As melatonin rises, so does feelings of sleepiness.Walking is affordable and accessible There's no gym membership, fancy exercise clothing or even walking-specific shoes you need to start. You also don't have to be trained to learn how to walk properly. All you need are a pair of comfortable, supportive shoes!",mid,mid,mid,low,low
Aniket-Kushare,"Rice is a staple food in most Indian homes. However, there are different varieties of Rice available here in India. Basmati Rice, Brown rice and White rice. Let us understand the health benefits of these three varieties.WHITE RICE: The milling and polishing processes of white rice removes most of the important vitamins and other nutrients from it. So WHO suggests and recommends that white rice be fortified with important vitamins and mineral premixes, as polished rice is nothing more than refined starch. Further research is required to build the evidence-base on the use of fortified rice and to develop global technical guidelines for rice fortification.Health benefits include: Gastrointestinal: White rice is one of the easiest and quickest foods to digest and requires only an hour to completely digest. Since white rice is low in fibre, it is very soothing to the digestive system and easily digested. So, it is great for relieving digestive disorders like diarrhoea, dysentery, colitis and even morning sickness. It is the best food for infants, young children and old people.Overall energy: the body needs carbohydrates to function and white rice is an excellent source of energy.Protein: Every 150g of rice has about 5 grams of protein.Rice powder is also used externally as a soothing powder in cases of skin inflammation such as small-pox, measles, prickly heat, burns and scalds.BROWN RICE: Brown rice has several health benefits. However, it is not very commonly used in Indian households mainly because people are ignorant of the health benefits of brown rice and secondly that it is costlier compared to white rice. The health benefits of brown rice includes:Brown rice is an excellent source of soluble fibre. It helps to lower the levels of 'bad' LDL cholesterol in the blood. There is also some suggestions that the oil present in brown rice or extracted rice bran oil may help lower harmful cholesterol levels and blood pressure, whilst raising the levels of 'healthy' HDL cholesterol.The fibre in brown rice means that the digestion time of this carbohydrate is slower than processed grains, including white rice. This means that there is a more controlled slower release of sugar into the blood stream and it has a lower glycemic index (GI) compared to other grains.Brown rice is very rich in vitamins and minerals and hence nutritionally more beneficial.BASMATI RICE: Basmati rice is another unique species of rice originating from India. Basmati rice is also one of the varieties of rice used in many families. There are different variants of Basmati rice available in the market at varying costs. Just like all species of rice, basmati is available in white or brown versions, depending on the extent of the milling process.Brown basmati rice is comparable to other types of brown rice in nutrient content (although it does contain about 20% more fibre compared to most other types of brown rice), and white basmati rice is comparable to other types of white rice. The health benefits of fibre has already been discussed earlier in the article.Basmati rice and Jasmine rice are long-grain varieties that have been cultivated to bring out distinctive flavour profiles. Long grain of the rice gives a royal look to the rice recipe prepared, be it plain jeera rice or vegetable pulao.Basmati rice has a typical, unique aroma. In the case of basmati, this aroma is due to the presence of a chemical called 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, which is found in basmati rice at about 90 parts per billion. That's about 12 times more than in other types of rice, giving basmati its special aroma.Other details on Diet and Fitness",mid,mid,mid,low,low

The JK Rowling's website devoted to all things Potter just got a complete make-over, complete with a new features section where fans will find everything from insights from Hagrid to how to make wands. Rowling also released a short history of the Potter family tree, titled ""The Potter Family."" Dating back to the 12th century, it's sure to satisfy even the most loyal Potterhead.- Fleamont Potter and his wife, Euphemia, are the parents of James Potter, Harry's dad. Unfortunately, both Fleamont and Euphemia died of dragon pox before Harry was born. They never got the chance to meet their grandson.- Fleamont Potter, Henry Potter's son, was quite gifted at wizard dueling. ""He [Fleamont] always attributed his dexterity at dueling to the number of times he had to fight people at Hogwarts after they had made fun of his name,"" Rowling explains. Like his ancestor Linfred of Stinchcombe, Fleamont Potter was also well known for inventing a potion. He's the mastermind behind ""Sleekeazy's Hair Potion,"" which fans might remember Hermione using to tame her hair for the Yule Ball. He later sold the Sleekeazy company for quite a profit, solidifying the Potter family fortune, Rowling explains.- Rowling finally explains the origins of all the bronze knuts and gold galleons Harry inherited. ""The Potters continued to marry their neighbours, occasionally Muggles, and to live in the West of England, for several generations, each one adding to the family coffers by their hard work,"" Rowling explained.- Linfred's daughter-in-law, Iolanthe Peverell of Godric's Hollow, brought the invisibility cloak into the Potter family line. Her grandfather, Ignotus Peverell, was the cloak's original owner, which was referenced in ""Tale of the Three Brothers,"" where Peverell was gifted the cloak for outsmarting death.- Never fear, the Potter family history is still ""illustrious"" thanks to their connection to the ""Deathly Hallows,"" the three legendary magical objects which make a person the master of death.Find more on Pottermore.",mid,mid,mid,low,low

Aniket-Kushare,"Maybe we could learn somethings from how Steve Jobs conducted effective meetings.1. He kept meetings as small as possible Jobs kept meetings with limited people.In his book ""Insanely Simple,"" longtime Jobs collaborator Ken Segalldetailed what it was like to work with him. In one story, Jobs was about to start a weekly meeting with Apple's ad agency. Then Jobs spotted someone new. ""He stopped cold,"" Segallwrites. ""His eyes locked on to the one thing in the room that didn't look right. Pointing to Lorrie, he said, 'Who are you?'"" Calmly, she explained that she was asked to the meeting because she was a part of related marketing projects. Jobs heard her, and then politely told her to get out. ""I don't think we need you in this meeting, Lorrie. Thanks,"" he said. He was similarly ruthless with himself. When President Barack Obama asked him to join a small gathering of tech moguls, Jobs declined - the president invited too many people for his taste. 2. He made sure someone was responsible for each item on the agenda Jobs held people accountable for each agenda item. In a 2011 feature investigating Apple's culture, Fortune reporter Adam Lashinsky detailed a few of the formal processes that Jobs used, which led Apple to become one of the world's most valuable companies.At the core of Job's mentality was the ""accountability mindset“- meaning that processes were put in place so everybody knew who was responsible for what. As Lashinskydescribed: InternalApplespeak even has a name for it, the ""DRI,"" or directly responsible individual. Often the DRI's name will appear on an agenda for a meeting, so everybody knows who is responsible. ""Any effective meeting at Apple will have an action list,"" says a former employee. ""Next to each action item will be the DRI."" A common phrase heard around Apple when someoneis trying to learn the right contact on a project: ""Who's the DRI on that?"" The process works. Gloria Lin moved from the iPod team at Apple to leading the product team at Flipboard - and she brought DRIs with her. They're hugely helpful in a start-up situation. ""In a fast-growing company with tons of activity, important things get left on the table not because people are irresponsible but just because they're really busy,"" she wrote on Quora. ""When you feel like is your baby, then you really, really care about how it's doing."" 3. He wouldn't let people hide behind PowerPoint Jobs preferred ""freewheeling face-to-face meetings"" to more formal ones. Walter Isaacson, author of the ""Steve Jobs"" biography, said, ""Jobs hated formal presentations, but he loved freewheeling face-to-face meetings."" Every Wednesday afternoon, he had an agenda-less meeting with his marketing and advertising team.Slideshows were banned because Jobs wanted his team to debate passionately and think critically, all without leaning on technology. ""I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking,"" Jobs told Isaacson. ""People would confront a problem by creating a presentation. I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they're talking about don't need PowerPoint.""",mid,mid,mid,low,low

What if there is a financial emergency and I get stuck without cash?""We don't want to pay the penalty on immature breaking of the FD, do we? This is exactly the pain point the banks have catered to by providing us with the sweep in facility.Sweep in facility is a hybrid deposit option that banks offer. It combines the convenience of a savings account with the high interest rates of a fixed deposit.So, what you needs to do is open an FD with all the money in your a bank account. Then opt for the sweep in facility on that FD. at this point, your savings account will show balance of Rs. O/-. But that should not bother you a bit as this is exactly how it is supposed to work.So now, any amount of money you use from the savings account will be deducted from the FD till the time you add money to your savings account. The advantage is that you will earn about 50-100% more interest on the deposited money. Your money would have attracted an interest of 3-4% in savings account. now you could enjoy 5-7.5% on the same amount.Any bank transaction you make will be deducted from the FD. ATM withdrawals, card payments, bills, EMIs, online shopping, SIP auto deductions, etc.Personally I have been availing this facility from HDFC Bank and have faced no inconvenience in any type of transaction. Every month, when I receive my salary, all the money is put in an FD and availed for sweep in.

If the virus cannot find an unvaccinated person to infect, it will die out.In 1988, when the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was formed by WHO, polio paralysed more than 350 000 people a year.

Aniket-Kushare,"Let us understand the health benefits of the three most common rice varieties.BROWN RICE: Brown rice has several health benefits. However, it is not very commonly used in Indian households mainly because people are ignorant of the health benefits of brown rice and secondly that it is costlier compared to white rice. The health benefits of brown rice includes:Brown rice is an excellent source of soluble fibre. It helps to lower the levels of 'bad' LDL cholesterol in the blood. There is also some suggestions that the oil present in brown rice or extracted rice bran oil may help lower harmful cholesterol levels and blood pressure, whilst raising the levels of 'healthy' HDL cholesterol.The fibre in brown rice means that the digestion time of this carbohydrate is slower than processed grains, including white rice. This means that there is a more controlled slower release of sugar into the blood stream and it has a lower glycemic index (GI) compared to other grains.Brown rice is very rich in vitamins and minerals and hence nutritionally more beneficial.WHITE RICE: The milling and polishing processes of white rice removes most of the important vitamins and other nutrients from it. So WHO suggests and recommends that white rice be fortified with important vitamins and mineral premixes, as polished rice is nothing more than refined starch. Further research is required to build the evidence-base on the use of fortified rice and to develop global technical guidelines for rice fortification.Health benefits include: Gastrointestinal: White rice is one of the easiest and quickest foods to digest and requires only an hour to completely digest. Since white rice is low in fibre, it is very soothing to the digestive system and easily digested. So, it is great for relieving digestive disorders like diarrhoea, dysentery, colitis and even morning sickness. It is the best food for infants, young children and old people.Overall energy: the body needs carbohydrates to function and white rice is an excellent source of energy.Protein: Every 150g of rice has about 5 grams of protein.Rice powder is also used externally as a soothing powder in cases of skin inflammation such as small-pox, measles, prickly heat, burns and scalds.BASMATI RICE: Basmati rice is another unique species of rice originating from India. Basmati rice is also one of the varieties of rice used in many families. There are different variants of Basmati rice available in the market at varying costs. Just like all species of rice, basmati is available in white or brown versions, depending on the extent of the milling process.Brown basmati rice is comparable to other types of brown rice in nutrient content (although it does contain about 20% more fibre compared to most other types of brown rice), and white basmati rice is comparable to other types of white rice. The health benefits of fibre has already been discussed earlier in the article.Basmati rice and Jasmine rice are long-grain varieties that have been cultivated to bring out distinctive flavour profiles. Long grain of the rice gives a royal look to the rice recipe prepared, be it plain jeera rice or vegetable pulao.Basmati rice has a typical, unique aroma. In the case of basmati, this aroma is due to the presence of a chemical called 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, which is found in basmati rice at about 90 parts per billion. That's about 12 times more than in other types of rice, giving basmati its special aroma.Other details on Diet and Fitness",mid,mid,mid,low,low

Aniket-Kushare,"Good news for you - individually both these cases are very common and millions have managed to get out of it.Case 1. If you go to India, take a firm stand against your MIL.Decide boundaries. Ask your hubby to help on deciding the boundaries (i am keeping fingers crossed that he chooses you over his mom.) Get a clarity on what you both want and don't want. Share that with in laws. Give time to your in laws to work on their points and have a healthy decision.It would be quite awkward to all of you sit together to discuss such things, but trust me, it does work. I can assure you that because many i know have done this and it has worked.Many face this awkward situation. Before marriage for love married (with own parents) and after marriage for arrange married (with in-laws)  so you are not alone.The best part is that you will have everything sorted once and for all. :)Case 2. From my experience, being far from relatives is the only time relatives love you. So even this option is not so bad. In your current situation, it could be quite frustrating to be alone all the time. especially your case of being on foreign land. You could join some classes like ice cream making, cakes, cooking, dancing, yoga, sport,  go to gym, learn foreign language, join NGO, freelance, etc. This will help against loneliness. Undertake online certified courses to hone your skills that could be useful when you start working later.The best part is that all of these things could be continued from any country you move to. :)",mid,mid,mid,low,low
Aniket-Kushare,"Late night cravings can ruin your diet, and those extra calories are hard to burn off. These tips can help you fight late night cravings.1. Eat Lots of FiberHigh fiber foods are low in calories, but keep you feeling full longer. Eat a diet rich in fiber to control cravings and late night hunger. Soluble fiber stabilizes blood sugar levels so that you don't wind up craving sugary treats at night, and insoluble fiber fills your stomach to reduce hunger pains. Eat a fiber rich evening meal that contains plenty of non starchy vegetables, and drink plenty of water throughout the day as well.2. Stay BusyOne reason late night cravings occur is because you're unwinding after a long day, and looking for a low stress way to occupy yourself. Take up a hobby, like knitting, reading, meditation, jigsaw puzzles or any relaxing activity that keeps your mind occupied and off snacking. Try to get out of the house for a few evenings every week; take a class or join a book club. If you're not at home and feeling bored, you'll be less likely to snack.3. Eat Dinner Later in the EveningMost people eat dinner fairly early in the evening, at six or seven o'clock. The problem with this is that it leaves you more likely to get hungry and start having cravings late at night. Push dinner back an hour or two, and you'll find yourself ready for bed before you have a chance to start craving a snack.4. Plan a Healthy Night-time SnackOne way to resist gorging yourself on sugary or fatty foods late at night is to plan a healthy late night snack. Bulk vegetable snacks, like carrot sticks, are high in fiber to fill you up; a high protein snack like low fat yogurt will also help you resist sugary treats like cake and cookies. Choose a snack like popcorn, that's low in fat and high in fiber, but can also be eaten slowly; you'll feel fuller with less food and you'll be able to indulge your impulse to snack for longer, without consuming too many extra calories.5. Eat Regularly Throughout the DayEating regular, healthy meals and snacks throughout the day helps to control your blood sugar levels so you're less likely to crave sugar and fats. Base your diet on complex carbohydrates like whole grains, but make sure you eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy products and lean meats. Eat breakfast within 90 minutes of waking up, and have small, healthy mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks to keep your blood sugar levels stable in between meals.6. Only Keep Healthy Foods at HomeThe best way to avoid eating sugary, fatty snacks is not to bring them home. If you only have healthy snacks in the house, you'll be forced to eat only healthy snacks.Source: 6 Effective Ways to Fight Late Night Cravings",mid,mid,mid,low,low
Aniket-Kushare,"Vitamin D may be known as the sunshine vitamin, but according to a new survey by Prevention and supplement company Centrum, few of us think to look for it in the fridge—and that's a big mistake.""The sun is not strong enough for the body to make vitamin D from October to May, especially for those living north of Atlanta,"" says Althea Zanecosky, RD, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. That's probably why nearly half of people tested at winter's end were low on vitamin D, according to a University of Maine study.The Institute of Medicine has set the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of vitamin D at 600 international units (IU) for everyone under the age of 70.

Aniket-Kushare,"American businesses lose an estimated $37 billion a year due to meeting mistakes. Steve Jobs made sure Apple wasn't one of those companies. Here are three ways the iconic CEO made meetings super productive: 1. He kept meetings as small as possible Jobs kept meetings with limited people.In his book ""Insanely Simple,"" longtime Jobs collaborator Ken Segalldetailed what it was like to work with him. In one story, Jobs was about to start a weekly meeting with Apple's ad agency. Then Jobs spotted someone new. ""He stopped cold,"" Segallwrites. ""His eyes locked on to the one thing in the room that didn't look right. Pointing to Lorrie, he said, 'Who are you?'"" Calmly, she explained that she was asked to the meeting because she was a part of related marketing projects. Jobs heard her, and then politely told her to get out. ""I don't think we need you in this meeting, Lorrie. Thanks,"" he said. He was similarly ruthless with himself. When President Barack Obama asked him to join a small gathering of tech moguls, Jobs declined - the president invited too many people for his taste. 2. He made sure someone was responsible for each item on the agenda Jobs held people accountable for each agenda item. In a 2011 feature investigating Apple's culture, Fortune reporter Adam Lashinsky detailed a few of the formal processes that Jobs used, which led Apple to become one of the world's most valuable companies.At the core of Job's mentality was the ""accountability mindset“- meaning that processes were put in place so everybody knew who was responsible for what. As Lashinskydescribed: InternalApplespeak even has a name for it, the ""DRI,"" or directly responsible individual. Often the DRI's name will appear on an agenda for a meeting, so everybody knows who is responsible. ""Any effective meeting at Apple will have an action list,"" says a former employee. ""Next to each action item will be the DRI."" A common phrase heard around Apple when someoneis trying to learn the right contact on a project: ""Who's the DRI on that?"" The process works. Gloria Lin moved from the iPod team at Apple to leading the product team at Flipboard - and she brought DRIs with her. They're hugely helpful in a start-up situation. ""In a fast-growing company with tons of activity, important things get left on the table not because people are irresponsible but just because they're really busy,"" she wrote on Quora. ""When you feel like is your baby, then you really, really care about how it's doing."" 3. He wouldn't let people hide behind PowerPoint Jobs preferred ""freewheeling face-to-face meetings"" to more formal ones. Walter Isaacson, author of the ""Steve Jobs"" biography, said, ""Jobs hated formal presentations, but he loved freewheeling face-to-face meetings."" Every Wednesday afternoon, he had an agenda-less meeting with his marketing and advertising team.Slideshows were banned because Jobs wanted his team to debate passionately and think critically, all without leaning on technology. ""I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking,"" Jobs told Isaacson. ""People would confront a problem by creating a presentation. I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they're talking about don't need PowerPoint.""",mid,mid,mid,low,low

Oils are vital for the human body to function properly and cannot be skipped totally.Here is the guide for choosing according to your needs. For low cholesterol, olive oil and rice barn would be the best. But it would be unfortunate to miss out on the advantages of other oils.Personally, I choose to shuffle between these oils so that we don't see much of the downsides of these oils.Coconut oilCoconut oil is extracted from the white, meaty part of dried coconuts. It adds a nutty, sweet texture to the food.Upside- Helps with sluggish thyroids as it raises the temperature of the body and increases its metabolism.- The high saturated fat content in the oil helps to keep the skin hydrated.Downside- It has high amounts of saturated fats.- It is known to put the heart at risk for cardiovascular diseases.Olive oilIt has been an essential part of the Mediterranean diet for years and is the current favourite of the health conscious.Upside- The Mediterranean region calls it a heart-friendly oil, as it reduces cholesterol levels of the body.- Known to be gentle on the stomach, olive oil helps in checking the growth of gallstones and stomach ulcers.Downside- It is unstable when heated, as it mixes with free chemicals and becomes hydrogenated, which may produce harmful trans-fatty acids.- Olive oil tends to lower one's blood sugar level. Diabetics should specially limit its intake.Mustard OilThe oil is a big component of Indian cooking. It's used extensively for massages as it increases blood circulation.Upside- Its consumption helps the intestine produce digestive juices.- It is antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory.Downside- Intake of copious amounts of mustard oil can cause respiratory issues, diarrhoea and anaemia.- When taken orally in raw form, mustard oil can cause irritation and inflammation of the lungs, gastrointestinal tract and intestines.Groundnut oil Used largely in East Asian food, groundnut or peanut oil is commonly used for frying because of its high smoking point.Upside- The sweet-flavoured peanut oil is almost free from cholesterol and is low in saturated fats.- Peanut oil is rich in resveratrol, which is known to prevent degenerative nerve disease.Downside- People suffering from peanut allergy should avoid food cooked in this oil, since they are susceptible to rashes and swelling.Rice Bran oilRice Bran oil is extracted from the outer brown layer of rice. It has a mild flavour and also a high smoking point.Upside- It improves blood cholesterol by reducing total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. It also helps increase the proportion of good cholesterol in the body.- It helps alleviate menopausal symptoms.Downside- Lowers the amount of blood calcium in the body. While this discourages the formation of kidney stones, it also makes one vulnerable to hypocalcemia.- Too much of it in one's diet can make one suffer irregular bowel movements.",mid,mid,mid,low,low

Aniket-Kushare,"""Is it was an indication that the relationship is not working...""Such times do come in every relation and everyone find their own ways to create topics to converse.In my case, the topic that she was interested was celebrities and watching Hindi movies and soaps on Colours and Zee TV. This was because that was the only thing she would get to watch after going home after office. Her mom used to watch it and didn't permit her to change the channel till sleep time. So she could talk about those for hours but I was least interested.I liked discussing my interests like sports, tech and travelling which she had no interest in. Also, we had decided never to discuss about office work unless very important. We thus always ended up running out of the topics and started to wonder if is it was an indication that the relationship is not working?Then, one weekend, I thought of watching a movie together. Couple of hours of entertainment and no fear of talking which could lead to running out of topics.After the movie we went for a snack and what I observed was that she could talk about the actors with me being interested and I could talk about cellphones used by the actors or the exotic locations the cast was travelling with her being interested.For example, after 'Piku' movie we could speak about Dipika Padukone's current affair, how her dad was a great badminton player, Amitabh's phenomenal acting, life in Kolkata city. We drifted to random topics like entrepreneurship, and how woman can be independent like the character of Piku, etc.So our journey of movies started and never did we ever run out of topics.",mid,mid,mid,low,low
Aniket-Kushare,"Along with socializing, walking with someone leads to covering more distance and lesser chances of procrastination. Walking has the ability to reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It's also effective enough to maintain weight and control pain from chronic disease. It is recommended that adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week as well as two days of resistance training. It is linked to lower rates of obesityPeople, who walk to work are less likely to be obese, according to a study. Walking just 20 minutes a day can reduce your risk of premature death by 30%. About 30 minutes of walking a day burns 150 calories, which can help you reach a calorie deficit that leads to weight loss.Walking helps prevent diabetesWalking regulates blood sugar levels, which keeps insulin levels low and diabetes at bay. Walking for 15 minutes after meals helped regulate blood sugar levels just as effectively as one 45-minute walk per day, said a study, which is good for those daunted by one big walking session.It is a good form of exercise for your heartEveryone knows that in the ranking of best-for-you exercises, running is better than walking, right? Not necessarily, and especially not when it comes to cardiovascular health. A study found that walkers who cover the same mileage as runners enjoy comparable reductions in high blood pressure, high cholesterol and coronary heart disease. While it took twice as long for walkers to cover the distance, walking may be a more sustainable and accessible activity than running for most people, especially those who are new to exercise.Walking is gentle enough for people of all body typesPregnant? Morbidly obese? Arthritic? Walking is gentle enough for most people who have these conditions, doctors agree, and the activity can help ease the pain of chronic illness — even if you have to start off by walking just two minutes a day.It lifts your mood and protects against depression and anxietyMoving your body is a good way to release endorphins, a set of feel-good chemicals that dull pain receptors in the brain, sedate you and even give you feelings of happiness and euphoria. That's why walking is recommended to help improve symptoms of mild to moderate depression. Walking briskly for 35 minutes five times a week, or 60 minutes three times a week, has a significant influence on mild to moderate depression symptoms.It'll help you sleep better at nightThere's a reason that travel experts advise you to walk around a new city on the day you arrive.

In few weeks' time the caterpillar will grow exponentially as much as 1000 times or more. Usually their first meal is their own egg shell.2. Caterpillars employ all kinds of strategies to avoid becoming a bird snack. Certain inchworms mimic twigs, and bear markings that resemble leaf scars or bark. Other caterpillars use the opposite strategy, making themselves visible with bright colors to advertise their toxicity. A few caterpillars, display large eyespots to deter birds from eating them.3. Caterpillars use toxins from plants to protect themselves from predators. Some plants produce toxic or foul-tasting compounds meant to dissuade herbivores from munching their foliage but caterpillars use it to their own advantage.4. Caterpillars produce Silk. Usually when they construct a cocoon, when they pupate or when they suspend a chrysalis.5. Caterpillars crawl like none other : Caterpillars crawl from back to front in waves. This is possible because of a unique ""two-body"" system of locomotion that has not previously been reported in any animal.6. Caterpillars have just 6 legs. Most of the extra legs that are visible are false legs, called prolegs, which help the caterpillar hold onto plant surfaces and allow it to climb.7.

I was going for a vacation with my family by a Mumbai Delhi flight. When waiting at the airport, I wanted to take a leak but skipped as I didn't want to miss watching other flights taking off from the runways.1. After boarding, it started with the cute looking air hostess lady ironically telling us about facing emergencies and filling air in life jackets if the plane landed in water.2. Then there was a crackle in the speakers and the captain announced that the flight would be taking off soon. The engines soon got loud and the plane slowly got on the runway. I then wanted to pee so badly but unfortunately I was kindly asked by the cute lady to be seated and keep the seat belt on.3. The loud sound now turned very loud and the incredible acceleration made me sink in the seats. In my mind I was like the person in the pic below but I decided to maintain my cool by looking at how calm other people were.4. And then... the take off..! Wooooooooow! It gave me goosebumps!Suddenly everything was normal afterwards and I realised that I was about to get a bladder blast. I got up from my seat wondering if the flights too had toilets similar to Indian railway toilets then. Where there was no collection chamber and the pee/shit would fall down on earth. Maybe the flight speed would make my pee fly back on me and i would smear it on my clothes.But thankfully it was nothing like that. I could happily take a long refreshing leak.

Also I could get clarity on the hullabaloo behind the stupid TV serial ""Raaz pichle janam ka"" on Indian television.During the past life regression procedure, i was not hypnotized by any type. I didn't eat or drink anything that was offered by the guide because i was quite sure he would give me hallucinogens.

Excessive exercise can also cause fatigue and sleep problems like feeling drowsy during the day and being unable to fall asleep at night.Could cause overtraining syndromePsychologists say that if one does not feel any excitement or joy that one usually feels for an exercise regime, it could be because of the effects of overtraining syndrome.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"From IITKGP (BSc + MSc) to Ghent University (PhD). Some things that I observed:You can treat a professor like an equal here. Talk to them openly about everything, go out for drinks with them, and crack jokes. There were only a couple of professors in IIT KGP with whom I could imagine doing all that. Graduate students here are on average way more smart than the undergrad students and not the other way around, as it is in IITs. Computer science is not the most sought after branch to study in a university, at least not here in Belgium. The smartest people usually end up taking maths or engineering. In many university courses group projects and group activities are a norm while I rarely saw that in India. Also, I have heard that copying of assignments doesn't happen much. In India I had never heard of or faced a situation where someone says ""Oh, you are studying maths! You must be really smart."" while here it seems like a very common thing to say. One of the questions that I posted a few months after coming here: What are some good ways to respond to ""Oh! You must be really smart!"" when you tell someone that you are doing a PhD in maths?Europeans love their holidays! Sometimes a little too much. I don't mind if we are allowed to take 35 days off in an year and to not work at all on weekends but it gets annoying when you feel like you are obliged to do so. Your peers expect from you that you would never work on a weekend and they treat you as a weirdo if you do. The university deducts your holiday money for the next year if you do not officially take 35 days off this year! I work when I want to work, and luckily in the work that I am doing right now I can afford to do so. The shops do not open on Sundays! That is among the most annoying things that I have faced.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"I will briefly discuss about some particular groups of people and their reasons to find mathematics difficult. Each group can have different reasons.  Most of what follows is based on personal experience and what I have read in different articles. Of course, in an answer like this there will be many generalisations:Mathematicians (or theoretical computer scientists) find it difficult because there are several easily stated but extremely difficult problems in maths which may take months/years/centuries to solve. And also because there are things like Inter-universal Teichmüller theory developed by fellow mathematician(s) which many professional mathematicians would not be able to understand.PhD students in mathematics find it difficult because they are going through a very difficult process of building a particular area of specialisation and learning how to generate new mathematics in that area. They face failure again and again before something good comes out in the narrowly focussed field they are working on.  Sometimes, even after 4-7 years of school nothing ""good"" comes out of it. Other students in mathematics/theoretical computer science/physics find it difficult because, well some of the stuff in abstract maths is quite difficult! It takes time to get used to things like Topology and Category theory but many students are not fortunate enough to have good teachers guiding them well through the process of learning these things. They have to grasp the basics of a wide spectrum of areas in mathematics which can be a difficult task. Students and professionals in other fields that use mathematics as a tool find it difficult because they may have some idea about the abstractness of mathematics but they haven't been exposed to it properly to be able to work out all the proofs of things that they are using (many wouldn't even see the necessity of proving that those tools work). If they are good at using the particular tools then they may not even find ""mathematics"" difficult.  Others (discussed in detail in some of the answers here) usually find it difficult because of the  difficult school experience they had in something which was disguised as mathematics but which was mostly just algebraic manipulations. You had to learn and practice certain algorithms (example: how to find an integral) on which you were graded. There were absolute markers set by the system which would tell you if you were good at ""maths"" or not. And due to some reasons like low IQ and lack of early childhood training, many would not do well in those things.  I believe most of them would not find maths difficult for those particular reasons if they were taught maths properly.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Expanding on Daniel Paleka's answer, here's how I would prove that the smallest number of such planes is 3n3n Disclaimer: this is probably not the best way for an IMO contestant to solve this problem. (Edit: probably it is)Lemma 1. Let PP be a polynomial in R[x1,…,xn]\mathbb{R}[x_1, \ldots, x_n] and let S1×⋯×SnS_1 \times \cdots \times S_n be a grid, Si⊂RS_i \subset \mathbb{R}, such that PP vanishes on all points of the grid but one. Then deg(P)≥∑i(|Si|−1)deg(P) \geq \sum_i (|S_i| - 1). The proof requires a nice result by Noga Alon called Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. This is not a particularly deep result and in fact anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of polynomials can understand the proof, but it has some far reaching applications (see this). Let me write down that result (Theorem 1.2 in the paper) without proof. Alon's Nullstellensatz. Let PP be a polynomial in F[x1,…,xn]F[x_1, \ldots, x_n], where FF is an arbitrary field. Say the degree of PP is d=∑ni=1tid = \sum_{i = 1}^n t_i, where tit_i are some non-negative integers and suppose that the coefficient of xt11⋯xtnnx_1^{t_1} \cdots x_n^{t_n} in PP is non-zero. Then, if |Si|>ti|S_i| > t_i for all ii there exist si∈Sis_i \in S_i such that P(s1,…,sn)≠0P(s_1, \ldots, s_n) \neq 0. It might be a good idea to first play around with that theorem and see what it really means. Now here's how Lemma 1 follows from this theorem.  Let a=(a1,…,an)a = (a_1, \ldots, a_n) be the point in the grid  where PP doesn't vanish. Say, the degree of PP is less than d=∑i(|Si|−1)d = \sum_i (|S_i| - 1).Note that the polynomial Q=∏i∏s∈Si∖{ai}(xi−s)Q = \prod_i \prod_{s \in S_i \setminus \{a_i\}} (x_i - s) is a polynomial of degree dd that vanishes on all points of the grid except aa. Let P(a)=λ≠0P(a) = \lambda \neq 0 and Q(a)=μ≠0Q(a) = \mu \neq 0. Look at the polynomial 1μQ−1λP\frac{1}{\mu}Q - \frac{1}{\lambda}P. It is a degree dd polynomial (since degree of PP was assumed to be less than dd) that vanishes completely on the grid (including the point aa) and has the non-zero term x|S1|−11⋯x|Sn|−1nx_1^{|S_1| - 1}\cdots x_n^{|S_n| - 1} in it. This contradicts the combinatorial nullstellensatz! Now, coming to the main problem. Let H1,H2,…,HmH_1, H_2, \ldots, H_m be the mm be the planes that vanish on all points of the grid {0,1,…,n}3\{0, 1, \ldots, n\}^3 but the origin. Any plane that doesn't pass through the origin is uniquely determined by an equation of the form a1x1+a2x2+a3x3=1a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + a_3 x_3 = 1.Therefore we have the polynomials Pi=ui⋅x−1P_i = u_i \cdot x - 1 that define these hyperplanes where uiu_i's are non-zero vectors in R3\mathbb{R}^3. Now you can easily check that the polynomial P=∏iPiP = \prod_i P_i satisfies the conditions of Lemma 1 with Si={0,1,…,n}S_i = \{0, 1, \ldots, n\} for i=1,2,3i = 1, 2, 3 and hence we have  deg(P)≥3ndeg(P) \geq 3n. But from the definition of PP its degree is equal to mm, and we are done. Remark 1 : It seems to me that this problem is inspired from the following paper of Alon and Füredi, Covering the Cube by Affine Hyperplanes, which in a certain way generalises the results of this paper by Brouwer and Schrijver, The blocking number of an affine space both of which use a very similar polynomial technique. The proof given by Alon and Füredi in that paper uses dimension arguments on polynomials instead of the combinatorial nullstellensatz which an be taken as another solution to this problem (Theorem 2 of that paper). Remark 2: There is no known solution of this problem that doesn't use polynomials in some way*. Peter Scholze was one of the 5 contestants who solved this problem completely in 2007. For his solution you can see Solution 1 here.Remark 3: Another way to prove Lemma 1 is by using the punctured combinatorial nullstellensatz by Ball and Serra. See Theorem 4.1 here.Remark 4: Investigations starting with this and some related problem led to the following joint paper of mine with Pete Clark, Aditya Potukuchi and John Schmitt: [1508.06020] On Zeros of a Polynomial in a Finite Grid.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"A good place to start would be chapter 2, 4, 5, 9, 11 and 13 of this book: Mathematical Circles. It is mostly a set of well chosen problems from which you'll get some basic feel for combinatorial problems. As Alan Guo points out, that's the best way to start learning combinatorics (discrete mathematics). Try to solve many problems, read the solutions (even if you have solved them) and then think about those problems. See how they can be generalised or how they could be solved using a different approach. Engel's book is also a great resource for problems. After that I would highly recommend following a well structured book like Cameron, A Course in Combinatorics: J. H. van Lint, R. M. Wilson or A Walk Through Combinatorics: M. Bona. This would give you a big picture of the subject and how different sub-areas are connected with each other. You'd also see many applications in Computer Science. I think this is an important step to reinforce your knowledge of the subject. Connect it with things you already understand. Beyond that you can try some more challenging problems from Lovász or go deeper into some specific area like Probabilistic Methods, Additive Combinatorics, Hypergraph Theory,  Analytical Combinatorics, Algebraic Combinatorics, Finite Geometry, Design Theory, Matroid Theory etc.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"I would present the proof of the Fisher's inequality by R. C. Bose. His proof gave birth to a whole new technique in combinatorics which later on turned out be extremely useful. Here's the result:Denote by [n][n] the set {1,2,…,n}\{1,2,\ldots,n\} and let FF  be a collection of subsets of [n][n] such that every member of FF is of the same size kk and any two distinct members intersect in exactly rr points. Then the size of FF is at most nn. (put in other words, you cannot have a uniform* collection of subsets of [n][n] of size more than nn if every pair of subsets intersect in the same number of points)And the proof: Any subset SSof [n][n] can be uniquely denoted by a binary string of length nn where you put a 11 on position ii if i∈Si \in S and 00 otherwise. If we consider each of these binary strings as vectors in the nn dimensional real space then it can be easily checked that for any two subsets AA and BB the number of elements in their intersection is the same as the dot product of their vectors. Now given a collection FF satisfying that condition write down the members of FF as row vectors of a matrix MM. If we assume that FF has mm elements then this matrix is of order m×nm \times n. The given condition translates into the property that the dot product of any two distinct rows of MM is rr and the dot product of any row with itself, i.e., the number of 11's in a row, is kk. This is the same as saying that the matrix MMTMM^T has kk on all diagonal positions and rr everywhere else. In other words, MMT=rJ+(k−r)IMM^T =  rJ + (k-r)I where JJ is the matrix with all entries as 11 and II is the identity matrix or oder mm.Using basic linear algebra (hint: eigenvalues) or some determinant techniques we can prove that the determinant of MMTMM^T is (k+r(m−1))(k−r)m−1(k + r(m-1))(k-r)^{m-1}. If k=rk = r then we would basically have just one subset in the collection FF and hence m=1≤nm = 1 \leq n. Therefore, we can assume that k>rk > r. But then MMTMM^T is an invertible matrix  and hence it has rank mm. This tells us that the rank of our matrix MM is at least mm which can only be true if m≤nm \leq n (since MM is of order m×nm \times n).Q.E.D. *this condition can be removed, see this or the lecture notes by Jacob Fox linked belowThe original paper from 1949 can be found here: A Note on Fisher's Inequality for Balanced Incomplete Block Designs. The basic idea of this particular technique is to represent the objects of interest as vectors in an nn dimensional space and then show that these vectors are linearly independent which proves that the number of vectors (and hence the number of objects) can be at most nn.There are many other interesting results that can be derived from this. For example, given a collection of nn points in the euclidean plane the number of lines determined by joining these points is at least nn (De Bruijn–Erdős theorem). For other examples of this cool technique of using linear algebra in combinatorics refer to the notes here or get a copy of this unfinished book by Babai.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"Disclaimer: I have been living in Ghent (Belgium) for 8 months. Obviously I am not claiming that these are the best or the worst things in the absolute sense (I don't think anyone can really answer that). This is just a personal opinion based on things I have observed till now in Ghent. Considering the diversity of Belgium, my experiences would have been quite different if I was living in some other part of Belgium. Best things: The music culture is great. In a short span of my stay here I have attended concerts by Dream Theater, Remember Shakti, Steven Wilson, The Aristocrats (band), Mogwai, Russian Circles and various local artists in the jazz festival. You see so much music on the streets too! They had kept a piano under the Market Hall where anyone could go and play. I have seen many brilliant performances there.This -  You'd see families happily travelling on such bikes. Everyone uses them! And the government gives you extra money if you go to  work on a bike!The waffles - (I ate that particular one in a place called Agrea in my first week in Ghent.)A lot of locals are Atheist and usually do not give a damn about religion(s). I have found some really funny portrayals of Jesus in local bars here which would probably be unacceptable in some other countries. Vegetarianism is being promoted a lot, especially in Ghent: Vegetarian Friendly Ghent. Worst things: It fucking rains all the time! Even in winters. Ok, I can actually handle rain. I can even handle cold. But both together, NO!As per some of the people I know here, it's usually not so easy to integrate with the locals. I know foreigners who have been living here for around 3-5 years without making any local friends.They close their shops at 6 pm and then don't open them during the weekend! When are we supposed to buy stuff? On the working days during the working hours? [Edit: apparently most of the shops are open on saturdays but not on sunday.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"You can take more risks. With high GPA (just like several other similar things) comes high expectations and hence less independence. I am sure there will be courses in which you got high grades because you really liked the subject. But, unless you are in a very specialised program it is very unlikely that you'd be able to maintain a high GPA without compromising on your interests. You may even start playing safe, like so many of my friends with extremely high GPA did. Taking courses which add no value to you at all besides a good grade. You would hesitate in taking that super interesting course in advanced graph theory because the professor is notorious for giving tough exams and low grades. On the other side, if you had a colourful grade card like mine with all grades from the lowest to the highest in almost every semester then you'll take that super interesting course, score highest marks ever in the mid term, lose your interest towards the end term, start skipping those morning classes, get an average grade in the end, but still manage a good recommendation from a well respected researcher for your graduate applications. (Ok, that might have been too specific. The obvious downside was that I couldn't even think of applying to some of the top grad schools in US/UK but in hindsight it all looks so badass!)Edit: I am not making a clear distinction between non-high GPA and low GPA.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"I will focus on finite geometry. Even though there are some books which can be read without ""many"" prerequisites I would strongly recommend that anyone interested in learning finite geometry should be comfortable with the following:Finite field, Linear algebra, Group action, Graph (mathematics),  Family of sets or Hypergraph, and programming in some Computer algebra system like Sage or GAP (the FinInG -- Finite Incidence Geometry package can be a good learning tool). Now to the textbooks. It's a bit hard to stick to just one single textbook for this area. Still, if I had to then I would go with Finite Geometries by Peter Dembowski. It's the textbook that many have used to teach this subject and it still has a lot to offer to researchers working in this area. But, I think it's probably not the book that everyone could read. For that, I would recommend this book/manuscript by Eric Moorhouse: http://www.uwyo.edu/moorhouse/ha....The required prerequisites for reading that book are provided there in the appendices and it also has further reading recommendations for those who want to delve deeper into the topic.  I have also shared my personal experience with learning this area  in a blogpost, Learning finite geometry, where I have given further book recommendations and learning resources.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Solving well defined, easily stated problems using ingenious arguments that don't involve much background in ""advanced"" mathematics is still a part of doing research in combinatorics. In fact combinatorial problems show up in many forms in other areas of mathematics too, but usually as a small part of a long argument after a lot of reduction (see this for example: Vipul Naik's answer to International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO): How relevant have you found your contest math experience to math study and research?). So, it can at times be helpful to have some training in solving olympiad type problems. But, you should know that research in combinatorics/discrete mathematics is much, much more than just solving such problems. Firstly, a lot of the research in combinatorics today is done using tools and ideas from other areas of mathematics (and the demarcation between different areas of mathematics is quite fuzzy). For example, you need a good background in topology (both general and algebraic) to tackle problems in Topological combinatorics, and you need a good background in group theory, linear algebra, representation theory to get into Algebraic combinatorics. See the wikipedia entry on various other such subfields of Combinatorics. Second, even if the research problems that you are attacking do not need a lot of background, they would need some mathematical maturity on your part which is what you are (ideally) trying to gain during your undergrad years. Learning algebra, analysis, topology, logic etc. are really helpful for that. Also, it's not always that clear what background in mathematics is required to attack a given problem. So, I would strongly recommend that you build a strong background in the traditional areas of mathematics, while exposing yourself to different aspects of combinatorics (see this for some book recommendations: Anurag Bishnoi's answer to What are the best books about combinatorics?). You could also try taking up some additional projects in areas of combinatorics that excite you (since you mentioned it: Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorems: Algebraic Approaches), so that you can get some idea about what research is like in those areas. Spending too much time on olympiad style problem during your undergrad years could be a big hindrance to that. Of course, if you enjoy doing it then go ahead and pursue it as a hobby. But, in my opinion, your time would be better spent in doing other things that I have advised.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Many generic answers have been given already. But I would like to give some personal anecdote as I haven't seen any of those yet. Also, I like talking about my work. Hopefully this would give you a rough idea of how the discovery and verification process goes sometimes. The new thing I discovered is a near octagon related to a well known finite simple group, G2(4)G_2(4). In simpler terms, it's a particular kind of graph which has a lot of symmetries and many interesting properties. How was  it discovered?For almost an year I was working on understanding and using certain techniques that my supervisor had developed to solve certain types of problems related to near polygons. It seemed quite interesting to me and after some work I was actually able to prove a nice result [1], a result that my supervisor conjectured to be true. But that's a different story.As an offshoot to that work I started doing some computations with something called the Hall-Janko near octagon (HJ). I wanted to compute all integer valued functions on its points satisfying certain conditions which may help me talk about other near polygons that contain HJ as a subgeometry. There was no known geometry that contains HJ (in a certain sense) so it seemed like what I was doing would just help me say something like ""There exists no near polygon that contains HJ (*conditions applied)"". But, I was in for a surprise. When I actually computed these functions both my supervisor and I saw that there might actually be a near polygon containing HJ. And to our surprise, there was one! I constructed it using these functions I had computed and checked that it is a near octagon, in my computer. The construction didn't look symmetrical at all as it had three different kinds of points but as I learned, looks can be deceiving. My idea was to construct the collinearity graph of this octagon and see how regular it is. Some obvious questions being, is it vertex transitive? distance regular? highly symmetrical? (these are the things I knew from my prior knowledge in the field of graph theory). Sage came to the rescue in answering these questions. It turned out that the graph had 503,193,600 symmetries and it satisfies many nice properties. After some google search I found out that there is in fact a well know group of that size, G2(4):2G_2(4):2. That looked quite suspicious. How do you verify it?So far all we had was just a computer model of this new near octagon along with some computations which showed that it has an automorphism group which is probably the same as G2(4):2G_2(4):2. In the mean time, I also learned about something called the Suzuki Tower. That looked highly interesting and I made several conjectures regarding how all those graphs in the Suzuki Tower could be constructed using the new octagon we had discovered. But all these are not really mathematical theorems. Just conjectures, which may or may not be true.So what we planned to do next was to somehow prove all these things that we thought should be true, preferably without using a computer. Getting motivated by some things that other people had done with such interactions of groups, geometries and graphs we came up with some ideas that might work. We would start with the group G2(4):2G_2(4):2, construct the the geometry using some of its involutions, prove that it is a near octagon and then prove all the conjectures we had formulated. Our efforts paid off and the plan worked. I wrote a draft with all the proofs and gave it to my supervisor. He checked everything, found some errors, suggested some edits and gave it back to me. I corrected everything, added some more things, changed the arrangement of certain theorems so that it flows better, and gave it back to him. This process went on for quite some time and when we both were happy with the final structure of how we would present our results, we have submitted the paper [2] to a mathematics journal. Is it falsifiable?Certainly it is possible that there are some big errors in our work which we somehow missed. Though we feel that it is highly unlikely. We have computer computations showing that everything we claim is true and all the proofs we have look mathematically correct to us. Also, another mathematician has verified some of our results. There can still be some gaps or mistakes in the proofs which the referees (other mathematicians that the journal editors would pick to check our work) would then probably point out, but if there are some I think those would be easily fixable. It could still be that the published paper, after going through the peer review, contains some errors which all of us missed. I have personally found some small mistakes in other published research papers. After all, mathematics is a human endeavour.  [1] Page on cage.ugent.be [2] [1501.04119] A new near octagon and the Suzuki tower",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"A linear operator is a linear function from a Vector space to itself. In notations, given a vector space VV, a linear operator is a function T:V→VT : V \rightarrow V which satisfies T(au+bv)=a(Tu)+b(Tv)T(au + bv) = a(Tu) + b(Tv) for all a,ba,b in the underlying Field and vectors u,vu,v.  A matrix with mm rows and nn columns over a field FF is a function from the set of all ordered pairs (i,j)(i,j) of integers in range 1≤i≤m,1≤j≤n1 \leq i \leq m, 1 \leq j \leq n  to FF. This function is usually written in a grid form as you can see on the wiki page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat.... The connection: Given a vector space of finite dimension nn and a  basis, for every linear operator on it there exists a unique matrix of nn rows and nn columns such that the value of operator at any vector uu is given by multiplying this matrix to the coordinates of uu with respect to the given basis, and vice versa. Therefore, once you fix a basis of a finite dimensional vector space a linear operator can be viewed as square matrix over the underlying field, which is sometimes helpful. Refer to  Justin Rising's answer to see an example of where the notions differ. Edit: See Debraj's answer for some other ways in which matrices can come into picture. It is important to keep in mind that a matrix in itself is nothing but an array (or a function as discussed above). Moreover, the index set of matrix need not even consist of integers nor is it necessary for the elements to be from a field.",high,high,high,mid,mid

Many would considered those to be serious prerequisites.  But I can't really think of any significant academic papers in modern day mathematics which could be read without this level of knowledge and comfort. Here are some in combinatorics (discrete mathematics) that anyone could read without serious prerequisites. I would also recommend that anyone who is interested in this area of mathematics (but not ""everyone"" in the general sense) should read them. De Bruijn–Erdős, A combinatorial probem, 1948. A classic by one of the most prolific and important combinatorialist, Paul Erdős. It demonstrates the kind of problems studied in extremal combinatorics. We are given some combinations (subsets) of a collection of objects and a condition on those combinations. We want to find out at most how many combinations there can be under these conditions.  We would also like to comment on how the combinations that reach this upper bound look like. R. C. Bose, A Note on Fisher's Inequality for Balanced Incomplete Block Designs, 1949. It's a short two page paper which arguably originated the so called linear algebra methods (the dimension argument, in particular) in Combinatorics. Aart Blokhuis, A New Upper Bound for The Cardinality of 2-Distance Sets in Euclidean Space, 1984. This one demonstrates the power of these dimension arguments. It uses a vector space of polynomials to determine at most how many points you can take with the property that every pair has distance a or distance b between them. In fact, just go ahead and read this book: Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics. The general philosophy can be described as follows:Given a set of points (or vectors, or sets) that satisfy some property, we want to say something about the size or the structure of this set. The approach is then to associate to this set a polynomial, or a collection of polynomials, and use properties of polynomials to obtain information on the size or structure of the set.Noga Alon, Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, 1999. This is a really powerful tool in combinatorics, which even a high school student can understand. In fact, it has already become a part of math olympiad teaching in many places. The general philosophy is the same, given a finite set of things, associate a polynomial with it, and then use this polynomial to say useful things about the set. Zeev Dvir, On the size of Kakeya sets in finite fields, 2008. This one generated a lot of excitement. It solved a famous open problem using really elementary means, that any math undergraduate can easily understand. Also see this, Dvir's proof of the finite field Kakeya conjecture. Again, it fits the general area of polynomial methods in combinatorics. So, you can clearly see my bias here.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"In school I had a decent enough exposure to only three subjects; physics, chemistry and maths. I never found chemistry that exciting and physics was good until it started seeming like they just come up with a new law when they find something new. Maths, on the other hand, always had this consistency to it. A new idea did not invalidate the previous one. Only assuming a few things to be true, you can build up everything and so you don't have to memorise a lot. So, by process of elimination I chose maths.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"At the bare minimum you would need to know basic linear algebra. There are many problems in combinatorics that you can solve by just using the concept of the dimension of a vector space. Some examples, The maximum number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., n} that pairwise share the same number of elements is n. The edges of the complete graph cannot be partitioned into fewer than n−1 complete bipartite graphs. Then you could refresh your knowledge of eigenvalues from linear algebra and delve into the area of Spectral graph theory. You could see how certain important classes of graphs like strongly regular graphs can be studied using the eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices. If you want to stretch that further then you could study Association schemes. Though, some knowledge of group theory is highly recommended for that. Or perhaps, you could look into the theory of expander graphs. For getting deeper into this area you'd need to understand the basics of group theory, field theory, ring theory, polynomials, etc. This is ideally covered in a standard introduction to algebra course. After that you could easily study topics like matroid theory, coding theory,  finite geometries and algebraic combinatorial geometry,  Some representation theory would also come in handy to study things like Young tableau. In summary, depending on what you want to study in algebraic combinatorics, you'll need to know the basics of group theory, field theory, representation theory and commutative algebra.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"I was born in a small hospital near my mother's village in the Sri Ganganagar District of Rajasthan, India and then raised in North West Delhi. My father belongs to a big family of farmers (9 siblings) where he was the only one who finished his schooling  (and later a diploma in civil engineering). Thanks to my dad's work as a civil engineer and my mother's support as a housewife our family transformed from a lower middle class family to upper middle class over the years. The transformation was quite interesting with a major step being my dad moving to Arab States of the Persian Gulf in pursuit of a job as a site engineer when I was 5 years old. It was the time of globalisation in India and several Indian engineers moved to those countries for promising jobs. He stayed abroad for 12 years while my mother raised me and my elder brother and sister on her own. We used to visit him in our summer vacations and he'd come home for some weeks in winters. My uncle (mom's youngest brother) stayed with us as well for some years till he got married and moved out. I have some nice childhood memories of learning cool stuff from him like whistling, kite flying, badminton and some field hockey. An important event that shaped my childhood was when I accidentally damaged my brother's eye while playing a stupid game. He got cataract and underwent a surgery because of it. He suffered a lot academically due to that and for some reason I started avoiding him after the accident. Probably because I blamed myself for his loss. Perhaps because of this and the fact that my father wasn't around I started giving my school friendships a lot of importance. I remember crying a lot whenever one of my close friends would change schools and move to a different city, which for some reason happened quite often.Academically I was usually around the top of my class without ever studying at home. Most of the classes in school were really easy and boring. I hated several of my teachers. One of them even slapped me when I was 10 over the fact that I was betting with a friend on something with real money. It seemed normal back then and I saw several forms of corporal punishment in my school. On a recent discussion with an old school friend we realised that many of our teachers were quite sadistic and we wonder what caused them to beat up such small kids. After 10th grade I chose physics, chemistry, maths and computer science as my subjects for the final 2 years of my school. The choice was driven by the fact that in all of my science textbooks till then they'd mention something really cool but then leave out the details saying that it will be covered later in senior years. I was a curious kid without access to internet or good science books. So, I thought I'll take those subjects when I grow up and see all the explanations. My parents supported my choice of subjects as it was a social norm at that time for kids with good academic records to choose science and maths while others would take commerce or arts. In 11th and 12th grade I started preparing for the entrance exam for IIT's by joining a well reputed coaching centre in Delhi. I really enjoyed that as it was something beyond the mundane school syllabus and I met several interesting and highly motivated people. I learned problem solving in maths, chemistry, physics and read a brilliant book on physics (Fundamentals of Physics). For the first time in my life I really had to put in some effort to understand academic subjects and solve problems. I started finding most of the social stuff like, going on trips, watching TV, hanging out with friends, as mundane and focussed on learning these cool things instead. In those 2 years I turned from a very outgoing person to an introvert. Towards the end of my school I started taking this entrance exam quite seriously and put in a lot of hours in practicing for that specific test. (Some background: it is a highly competitive test for one of the most prestigious undergraduate institutes in the country with an acceptance rate of ~2%). I managed to get a decent rank (~2400) after making a lot of blunders in the final exam. My parents, friends and relatives were really happy for me for while I was sad when I got the results as my final performance in the exam was far, far worse than I had expected. I chose to study a 5 year course mathematics and computing at Indian Institutes of Technology Kharagpur.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"Expectations I had that the institute (IIT KGP) did not deliver on:Freedom to choose things that I want to study. Teachers who properly understood the things that they were trying to teach.Healthy interaction between students and teachers. Freedom to spend a semester or more at some other institute in India and abroad, i.e., exchange programs. Decent housing facilities. No, I do not think that it is very difficult for an institute to deliver on some of these things. The quality of teachers can be improved by introducing audits of existing courses by external scientists/engineers/mathematicians and holding the professor accountable for their outdated (and sometimes fake) courses; making sure that they do not hire people with terrible research/educational background; taking student feedback more seriously by encouraging direct dialogue between student representatives and the faculty of the course;reducing the unlimited power given to the professors which can be and is abused by some of the faculty.

Such level of ego and delusion explains the lack of initiatives in this direction. Students should be allowed and in fact encouraged to go to different universities for a semester or more. With the amount of funds that IITs receive I don't understand how they cannot make decent living facilities for students. Building rooms which do not look like a prison cell should certainly be at a higher priority than building gardens and lakes with fake swans in them.Edit: good news regarding the student exchange programs, IIT-Kharagpur breaks glass ceiling to go global courtesy alumnus funding - The Times of India",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Let's try solving one of the simplest problem on IMO, problem 1 in the 1959 paper: Prove that the fraction 21n+414n+3\frac{21n + 4}{14n+3} is irreducible for every natural number n.The first thing that I'll ask myself after reading this is, ""When is a fraction irreducible?""Answer: when the numerator and denominator do not share any common factors. It may not look like it but I have made some progress because of asking that question. I have reduced the problem to showing that 21n+421n + 4 and 14n+314n + 3 do not have a common factor (irrespective of what natural number n is.)If we had two constant numbers, say 6 and 15, then I would know easily whether the fraction 6/15 is irreducible or not by checking all the factors of 6 (2, 3) and all the factors of 15 (3, 5) to see that they share a common factor 3. Hence the fraction 6/15 is not irreducible. (Its irreducible form is 2/5)This would work perfectly well if we knew about all the factors of numerator and denominator. But sadly, this doesn't help in our problem. Since, we have no way of knowing what the factors of 21n+421n + 4 or 14n+314n + 3 are. Sure, we can try to plug in some values of n to see if there is a pattern or not (as I would have done in the absence of any prior training) but that doesn't seem to help here. So, I need to ask myself more questions. My knowledge of a thing known as Greatest common divisor tells me that two numbers a,b do not share a common factor with each other if and only if there gcd is 1. Because of this knowledge I have been able to reduce the problem to, ""Prove that gcd(21n+4,14n+3)=1gcd(21n+4, 14n + 3) = 1 for all n"". (This is a general principle in mathematics, look at the extremum case. In this problem we had no hope of finding all possible divisors/factors but we can probably say something about the greatest common divisor.)Now I use another thing from my prior knowledge, Euclidean algorithm. This is a brilliant way of computing gcd's of two numbers fast and efficiently. But in fact, it can help us with our problem here. We have, gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = gcd(7n + 1, 14n + 3) = gcd(7n + 1, 7n + 2) = gcd(7n + 1, 1) = 1.And we are done! We have proved that for any given n the gcd of those two numbers is 1, so the fraction has to be irreducible. If you had found this problem (and the argument) to be really tough then you'll find other IMO problems to be almost impossible to solve. But, that can change. It certainly changed for me. In my first year of college I was stuck at this problem for hours: ""Prove that in a pythagorean triplet one of the three numbers must be divisible by 3."" It seemed like an impossible thing to do. But, after I trained myself and learned some basic number theory, more specifically Modular arithmetic then I could see how this is a really easy problem. In my opinion, what you can do now to get better at such questions is learn some more maths like number theory, combinatorics and geometry which isn't covered in high school curriculum. I can recommend a good place to start: Mathematical Circles: Russian Experience (Mathematical World, Vol. 7): Dmitri Fomin, Sergey Genkin, Ilia V. Itenberg: 9780821804308: Amazon.com: Books. But, I am sure you can find more relevant suggestions elsewhere. It would certainly help to find a math tutor who has experience in teaching olympiad level stuff. Good luck.Edit: If I was solving the problem right now then all I would have done is to just write that computation involving gcd's since everything else I mention here is of secondary nature now.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Give him some nice problems to work on rather than going directly into theorem-proof style stuff. For example, it wouldn't take too much time to define what a graph is, after which you can talk about this famous problem: in every group of six people, either there are three who are mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. Ok, this one might not be a great example since one can simply compute all possible graphs on six vertices (2152^{15} is not that big) using a computer and then check all of them individually but the general  proof of existence of Ramsey numbers  is pretty cool. As another example, ask him if one can tile a chess board which has a square deleted by 2×12 	\times 1 tiles? What if you want to do it with L-shaped tiles? For the L-shaped tiles can you do the same thing with any n×nn 	\times n chess board? What condition on the dimensions would suffice to prove existence of a tiling? Once you have guessed a condition, can you prove that it always works?What these problems indicate is that proving mathematical results is not that different from solving fun puzzles. In the first problem you could get away by listing all possibilities but that doesn't work if you want to solve a problem which involves infinitely many cases. Even for finite stuff usually the problem size is so big that you can't solve it by any feasible computational power. A proof comes in handy then. You can find more such problems here or somewhere online like this. Once you are familiar with some basic techniques of mathematical proofs it might be a good idea to make those ideas concrete and make sure that you understand what a proof is. Books like this may help. After that getting started with some standard stuff like group theory, topology and analysis shouldn't be so tough.  There are several great books and online resources available for that.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"I'll base my answer on personal experience. So bear with me in case this doesn't sound like a general advice. The first life-changing event for me was when I learned about Time signature. I started counting while listening to songs and discovered things like 3/4 and 7/8 in songs that I have known for so long. All the music I listened to after that became so much more than just a catchy tune I can hum along. I moved on from listening to the usual vocal based pop music to genres like progressive rock/metal, blues and jazz. I could really understand what was going on there on the drums and started playing guitar riffs in odd time signatures like stream of consciousness by Dream Theater. I could see why the swing beat is not just something you get or don't if you have a ""feel"" for music or not but it is something that can be learned. It was mathematical!The second one was when i learned scales and some basic music theory like how chords really work. Why certain tunes sound melodious/catchy over a specific background music. Why vocals in harmony sound good and how to make your own harmonies. As a listener I started noticing subtle chord changes and bass lines which I was oblivious to earlier when all I could hear was the basic tune that the vocalist was singing.  All this was a result of talking to friends who knew about this stuff, reading books and playing what I was listening on a guitar. I can recommend this book which I found really helpful for understanding these basics: The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory. Good luck!",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Since you mentioned problem solving as well, I recommend that you start with Mathematical Circles: Russian Experience and The Art and Craft of Problem Solving: Paul Zeitz. If you have some school experience in math olympiad then you may find the first one a little elementary but it's still worth a read. Moving on, you need to first realise that math is quite different from what you studied for jee. To first understand what the difference is, I would recommend Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction and What Is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods. You should also read this brilliant essay by Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology. Personally, I got good insights from reading about History of Maths as well. You can try Mathematics and Its History by Stillwell or Men of Mathematics by E.T. Bell for a less accurate but more fun description of famous mathematicians and their mathematics. These books would certainly boost your interest in math and beyond that you can read specific books on specific topics that you find interesting.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"Given a biregular bipartite graph, i.e., s+1 edges through each vertex in one partition and t+1 for the other partition, of diameter d and girth 2d is it necessary that s and t are prime powers? (assume s and t are greater than 1 and d is greater than 2 to remove trivial cases)For the smallest non-trivial case (d = 3) this is the same problem as the Prime Power Conjecture. It is open for every other case as well. (* this is a false statement, see the edit)Though I must say that it is not really an unsolved problem of graph theory. Certainly many mathematicians would consider it to be a problem in finite geometry and not graph theory. So, let me give another example: A subset S of vertices V in a graph G is called a dominating set if every vertex outside S is adjacent to some vertex in S. The minimum size of a dominating set in a graph G is called the domination number of G. Must it always be the case that the domination number of the cartesian product of two graphs is at least as big as the product of the individual domination numbers? The Vizing's conjecture from 1968 states that this inequality must always be true. I recently met some mathematicians at the International Conference of Graph Theory who are trying to find counter examples to this conjecture using the kind of bipartite graphs that I mentioned before and the incidence graphs of some other things like Combinatorial designs.Edit: for the case of d = 4, there are known classes of graphs for which s = q - 1 and t = q + 1 where q is a prime power but that's all.  Some references: Finite generalized quadrangles (see chapter 3)Generalized Polygons (Monographs in Mathematics): Hendrik van Maldeghem",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Oh several times! Being from India, it's almost always an interesting experience when you try to correct the ""teachers"", be it school or college. Most of my school experiences revolve around asking ""bad"" questions rather than correcting the teachers so I'll narrate a recent incident from my first class of object oriented programming in third year of undergraduate studies. (Since I am a first year phd student now and I did a 5 year bachelors plus masters, this happened around 3 years back.)When talking about data hiding in C++, after a long list of fancy terms which we haven't heard of, our professor mentions that a private data member of a class cannot be accessed directly (using the dot operator) outside the class. You can only return it using procedures of the class. But, if you are inside the main function then you can simply access it directly using the dot operator. Since most of the students already had some exposure to C++ we knew that it was wrong. Unaware of what this prof was capable of, we simply raised our hands to point it out that you can't do that. He refused to believe us. Things like ""but it's the main function"" were thrown at us and what not! Finally he said something like, ""fine show it to me in the computer lab after the class."" As instructed, we went to the lab and showed it to him. And obviously there was an error message. When we explained the error message to him, all he said was ""Oh this is okay, this computer must be using some different compiler. I use ANSI C++"". After that we lost all hope and just returned back to our rooms. We made a mental note of never attending his classes until he starts giving threats of de-registration from the course. Well, we actually did attend a few more classes to get some more gems out of him like this one. I guess my batch mates Shikha Singh and Sanjoy Das would be able to tell us about those similar incidents.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Incidence geometry was used by Jacques Tits in the study of finite simple groups and a major chunk of it was developed by him then. In some way, he was reversing the trend of studying geometry via group theory. Some of the concepts introduced or studied by him are generalized polygons, polar spaces and buildings. These are important geometrical objects for studying groups of Lie type. In late 70's Buekenhout developed the notion of Diagram Geometries in hope of using a geometrical approach (in the sense of Tits) to classify finite simple groups. Even though the classification was completed without the full use of this approach it is still a very important concept to study the sporadic groups in a uniform manner.Before Tits, Beniamino Segre initiated the study of projective/affine spaces over finite fields. He used some classical algebraic geometry and combinatorial techniques to prove several highly non trivial results. In words of Bueknhout [3] "" In many respects all of us, including Tits, were students of Segre"". The projective and affine spaces over finite fields are now important objects for combinatorics, coding theory, design theory, etc as I have mentioned in my earlier answer: What is the significance of the projective plane in mathematics?. Finite geometry is also used in the study of finite semifield, aka, non associative division algebras (see [1]).Incidence geometry also plays a significant role in graph theory, as regular near polygons are an important class of distance regular graphs which in turn are important for the study of association schemes. Moreover, generalized polygons (buildings of rank 2) are precisely the Moore graphs of even girth and hence they give important infinite classes of cages  (see chapter 3 in [2] and the Section 2.2 in [10]). Description of all known cages is available here: http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graph....Generalized polygons are also used in constructing extremal cycle free bipartite graphs [13].As another example, the bipartite graphs formed by taking incidence between points and hyperplanes of a finite projective space form highly expanding graphs with the least number of edges, see [9].Another application of some structures from incidence geometry, like generalized polygons, is construction of LDPC codes [11], [12]. For a historical overview of incidence geometry see [3] and [4]. In my opinion [5] and [6] are good introductory texts for this subject. Some of the important research topics in Galois Geometry (geometry over finite fields) can be found in [7]. References:[1] http://cage.ugent.be/~ml/LaPo201...[2] http://www.cs.elte.hu/~hetamas/p...

Anurag-Bishnoi,"I was planning to apply to UMich, Waterloo, UCSD, Delaware, Minnesota and UOttawa through the standard procedure of PhD applications in US/Canada. But finally I chose Ghent University after submitting my full application to just Delaware and Minnesota, and then skipped the other applications. The main factor in including a university in my list was to look for a place which had at least more than one faculty working in research areas I was interested in. After that I had a list of around 15 universities which I filtered down to 6-7 based on the idea that I'll have 1-2 highly ranked universities (where I was unlikely to get selected), 3-4 middle ranked places and 1-2 low ranked places (where I was positive about getting in) in my list. Then I contacted the people I was interested in working with to ask if they are taking any new PhD students and if I am a good fit for the department. Some of them replied positively and encouraged me to apply, others didn't reply at all.  How did Ghent came into picture? Here's how: I had a pre-final year summer internship in ISI Bangalore with Prof. Bhaskar Bagchi where I learned about finite geometry, algebraic graph theory, association schemes, design theory, group theory and how these are interconnected to each other.  He's a brilliant mathematician and he patiently taught me a lot of things despite my not so good background in maths. Learning from him personally and understanding clearly what it is that he does as a mathematician inspired me a lot and reinforced my belief in pursuing a career in maths. At the end of the internship I asked him about other places in the world where they do research in finite geometry. The first and the most important place he recommended was the incidence geometry group in Ghent University. I contacted some of the people in that group asking if they had any PhD opening. One of the senior most person replied. He liked my resume but he was retiring so he forwarded my email to other people he knew. In october two of the people from the department replied with their proposed projects asking me that I can apply to them if I am interested. One of the projects was related to algebraic/absolute geometry which I had no idea about and so I didn't apply in that. The other one was something that seemed exciting to me, a mixture of finite geometry, group theory, combinatorics and some computer programming. I showed my interest in that project and we talked about it over email but I kept on working on my other PhD applications as this was not a sure thing. I was lucky that this guy was invited to a conference in India in December which gave us the opportunity to meet personally. After that I was quite certain that I want to work with him. After a few weeks he asked me about my preference order in case I get selected in states as well as Ghent. I thought about it for some time and discussed with my professors. Finally, I decided that irrespective of what I get in states I would prefer to work in Ghent due to the following reasons: Even if I get into a school of my choice in states, it's not certain that I'll land up with the mathematician I was interested in working with or in the area I was interested in working with. My only contact with the professors in states was through emails but on the other hand I was able to personally meet this guy from Ghent and talk to him about his work and other related (sometimes unrelated) stuff. I wouldn't have any teaching obligations in Ghent, my grant would be a research grant without any other departmental duties. I wouldn't be obliged to clear a particular set of exams (quals) in Ghent and I'll get the freedom to choose whatever courses I want to pursue. The research group in Ghent is one of the most renowned one in finite geometry and there are many people working on finite geometry and related areas. So, if things don't turn out so well with my supervisor I can work with some other person in the department to complete my thesis. The professor ensured me that my grant would not be tied to the particular project which he had proposed and I'd be free to pursue anything in the related areas. Then I told this to the professor in Ghent and in a few weeks he confirmed his decision. After that I didn't bother about applying to other places that were left on my list as it'd be a waste of money (PhD applications are expensive in states!). Finally I did get selected in Delaware (Minnesota kept me in the waiting list and then rejected me) and realising that the graduate pay there was half the amount of what I was getting in Ghent made me a little happier about my decision :P",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"It depends on the problem I am trying to solve. If it is some exercise from a book that I came across while learning a new topic then I would probably just look for some hints in the solution manual or online so that I can make some progress. And then once I have solved the problem, albeit by some 'cheating', I would make the solution my own by making notes on it, explaining it to others, or applying similar arguments to other problems. If it is a research problem I am working on then I won't be able to just look up for some solution in a manual. My experience as a mathematician is quite limited since I started my PhD just about one year ago. But I suppose I can share a thing or two about some of the stuff I have already worked on. What I did in the few research problems I was able to solve finally was to take many breaks while keeping my progress till that point at the back of my head. The breaks could last from a few days to several weeks. In those breaks I would try to keep myself busy and productive by studying different things. I would sometimes simplify the problem into something manageable, add more constraints so that I can at least solve some special case of it. Luckily this worked sometimes leading to small progress and when it didn't I would go talk to my supervisor about it. Some of the approaches he'd suggest would probably fail but at least it will keep me busy with the problem. Finally, if I am lucky, there would be a day when I get that crucial insight while taking a shower or walking on the street, and after working through the details I would write down something like this on my research blog - The ugly case died today. So now we have a theorem: It is moments like these that keep me motivated. Even though they are rare, they are totally worth it. Of course it doesn't mean that it is only for those moments that I am doing research in maths, but I guess they are quite important.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"First, some mathematicians have already discussed in detail about problem solving in math and I would like to list two of my favorite books on this:1. The Art and Craft of Problem Solving: Paul Zeitz: 9780471789017: Amazon.com: Books2. Amazon.com: How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method (Princeton Science Library) (9780691119663): G. Polya: BooksThere can be several reasons why you get stuck on a problem which you are probably blaming on intuition. You can try going through these books to improve your problem solving skills in general. Now, I don't think you can really solve any problem in maths without first thinking about it or by a stroke of genius. If you don't have to think first then may be it's not a problem but just an exercise* where you are applying your previously mastered knowledge without much thought. Since, you are saying that you ""always start, only think while reading the question"" it could be the case that you are not being exposed to challenging problems. Try some problems from national/international level maths olympiad and see if you can solve them using the same approach? (Olympiad Resources • Art of Problem Solving). Sometimes intuition does play an important role in solving a particular problem but it is seldom the only thing involved in the process. Proper understanding of the problem statement, associating it with things you are already familiar with, comfort with logical reasoning, etc. play a significant role as well. * Here I am using the terminology by Paul Zeitz from the first book: We distinguish between problems and exercises. An exercise is a question that you know how to resolve immediately. Whether you get it right or not depends on how expertly you apply specific techniques, but you don 't need to puzzle out what techniques to use. In contrast, a problem demands much thought and resourcefulness before the right approach is found.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"I suppose at this stage I can safely say that I am good at maths. A short answer to your question is that I don't remember a lot of properties, at least not in a way that you seem to be suggesting.  In fact, I am pretty bad at memorising facts. Even if you tell me that x3+8=(x+2)(x2−2x+4)x^3 + 8 = (x+2)(x^2 - 2x + 4) I won't be able to keep that in my memory for more than a few minutes*. May be I could if I tried really hard, but that would require an amount of effort that I simply do not want to put in. As an anecdote, when I was 12, my elder brother challenged me to memorise a small english paragraph and then repeat it verbatim. I couldn't. So, how am I able to solve mathematical problems? I don't think I have a completely satisfactory answer to that. If you are asking for this particular problem, then my thought process would be quite similar to that of Thomas Dalton's. In general, here are some things that seem to help in doing mathematics:Understand the basics, and understand them well. In this particular example, understanding polynomial division, and how it implies that a degree d polynomial has at most d zeroes, is useful. And that would be useful in many more situations. Which is how you kind of remember it as well. Use the things that you have understood as much as you can. My PhD supervisor (who is certainly quite good at maths) did a course in Algebraic Topology when he was a masters student, and he probably aced it. But, he hasn't used any fact from that course for the past 20 years. So, he told me that he doesn't remember much. Of course, he would be able to re-learn most of the concepts at much faster pace now, than he did when he first learned them. Make connections. When you learn a new idea, think about how it relates to the things that you have already learned.  Can it be used to solve some problems that you solved earlier in a much ""nicer"" way? Does it give a more uniform approach to some ad-hoc techniques that you learned earlier? It helps to ask yourself these questions. It also helps to look for answers to these questions in books/notes or on the internet, even if you have come up with some answers yourself. Beyond this, you can read what other people who are good at maths have to say about this: How my math skills improved dramatically, Learning portal - Cognito, Solving mathematical problems, Letters to a Young Mathematician.* Though, I  might be able to remember  that x3−y3=(x−y)(x2+xy+y2)x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2) since I have used that identity a lot to solve some math problems, when I was in school. And then, I would just write x3+8=x3−(−2)3x^3 + 8 = x^3 - (-2)^3.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Classification of finite simple groups could probably be considered as combinatorial breakthrough, though that would be a bit of a stretch . At least, most of the sporadic groups appeared as automorphism groups of combinatorial structures. I have heard from important mathematicians that these results were some of the biggest breakthroughs in combinatorics: Robertson–Seymour theorem, Szemerédi regularity lemma, Lovász local lemma. But the field of Combinatorics is too broad to be able to give a satisfactory answer to this question. Every major breakthrough in coding theory, design theory, graph theory, matroid theory, finite geometry, polyhedral combinatorics etc. could be considered a breakthrough in combinatorial mathematics. Still, here are some of my favourite combinatorial breakthroughs*:This short paper by R. C. Bose which initiated the use of linear algebra in combinatorics: A Note on Fisher's Inequality for Balanced Incomplete Block Designs. See my blog post for details and further references: The origins of the linear algebra method in combinatorics. The paper by Segre on ovals in finite projecitve planes is one of the most significant results in finite geometry and it's one of the first of its kind: Ovals in a finite projective plane. Also check out his ICM talk on the topic: On Galois Geometries.These two papers by Erdös (not the first of their kind) gave rise to probabilistic methods in combinatorics: Graph Theory and Probability I, II. The role of Alfréd Rényi should not be overlooked. See this: Erdős–Rényi model.This 1976 paper by Peter Cameron established an interesting and useful link between seemingly disjoint areas: Line graphs, root systems, and elliptic geometry, which later played an important role in spectral graph theory: Graphs with least eigenvalue −2; a historical survey and recent developments in maximal exceptional graphs One of the first uses of topological methods in combinatorics by  László Lovász, to prove Kneser's conjecture, opened up a whole new branch of mathematics. It's also now one of his most cited papers: Kneser's conjecture, chromatic number, and homotopy. For further details, see this  and this.Another big breakthrough by Lovász was his work on the Shannon capacity of a graph. The counterexamples to Borsuk's conjecture found by Jeff Kahn and Gil Kalai in 1993 was a pretty big breakthrough. In 2013 Andriy V. Bondarenko showed, using the strongly regular graph related to the finite simple group G2(4)G_2(4), that this conjecture is false for all dimensions greater than or equal to 65. See this blog post: Borsuk's Conjecture is False for Dimensions Greater Than 65!The solution of  finite field version of  the Kakeya conjecture by Dvir is a very recent breakthrough. See this blog post by Terence Tao: Dvir's proof of the finite field Kakeya conjecture, and this survey paper on Polynomial Methods in combinatorics. A counterexample to the Hirsch Conjecture found by Francisco Santos in 2010 is a big breakthrough in Polyhedral combinatorics as it solved one of the oldest open problems in linear programming.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"In my opinion linear algebra is the most crucial subject of undergraduate mathematics. So I would certainly recommend that you understand a good amount of it. I have mentioned some sources here: Anurag Bishnoi's answer to Linear Algebra: What are some good resources for gaining an intuitive understanding of linear algebra?I would also suggest that you make your background in calculus a bit stronger. You can probably start real analysis directly from a book like Rudin or you can read Spivak (one of my all time favourite textbooks). Some easily accessible topics that you can try after that are graph theory, combinatorics, algorithms, coding theory, elementary number theory and cryptography. You would see a lot of linear algebra in these which will help you revisit some concepts and make your understanding stronger. Group theory is another crucial subject. You would have a lot of interesting examples of groups to work with if you are already comfortable with linear algebra, still you can start group theory right away. You can find many good book recommendations on quora and stackexchange.There are many other topics which are covered in undergrad mathematics programs. It would be good to have some idea about probability theory, topology and algebra but beyond that you can pursue things that interest you the most.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"I did my coaching at the Vidyamandir classes in Delhi (2006-2008). I enjoyed that a lot as it was something beyond the mundane school syllabus but in hindsight it doesn't seem that great. The reason I joined it was not because I was certain about appearing for JEE but because my brother had told me that I should try entering that place for the interesting experience. I was initially reluctant but after the entrance exam I gave, it seemed like a cool place to be. And towards the end I became quite focused on clearing JEE as I was convinced that it was the only way for me to get a decent college education in India (I was totally wrong about that! Read Anurag Bishnoi's answer to What made you work hard to get into IIT?) Some good things about that coaching: I realised the importance of making good notes. I learned a lot about teaching and saw clear differences from the school teachers. I became a better problem solver. I met some really devoted and interesting people there. Some bad things: They didn't support reading books on different topics on your own and never recommended any either. I realised later how detrimental that was to my proper understanding of the three subjects. At times it became too focussed on clearing that particular exam than actually learning real things. I realised later that many ""tricks"" that they taught could have been taught in far better ways. There was absolutely no focus on proofs or olympiad style problems in Mathematics. It was mostly about getting used to enough tricks to be able to solve the JEE exam well. In hindsight, if I had better resources and guidance available I would have been better off studying on my own through books. But given the position I was in at that time, going through that coaching was the arguably the best thing that could have happened to me.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"I will mention some active areas that are close to my work and area of expertise. Finite Geometry Here's a recent survey in this area: Current Research Topics in Galois Geometry. And here's the list of talks from a 2014 conference on finite geometries: Irsee2014. You should also check out this recent book to see some of the connections between finite geometry, extremal combinatorics and coding theory: Finite Geometry and Combinatorial Applications. Polynomial MethodsThis survey by Terence Tao is probably a good place to start: the polynomial method in arithmetic combinatorics, incidence combinatorics, and number theory. But you should remember that every researcher has his own biases. There are some topics in the so-called polynomial method that are not touched in that paper, for example polynomials in finite geometries. It's still a pretty good survey.Also check out some answers here: How to recognise that the polynomial method might work and these posts on my blog polynomials | Anurag's Math Blog. Network Coding TheorySee this big European project on this topic: Random Network Coding and Designs over GF(q). This is very much related to the combinatorics of finite vector spaces, and hence finite geometry. q-analogs of classical combinatorial results also play a significant role here. See [1305.6126] Problems on q-Analogs in Coding Theory. Spectral Graph Theory This is a huge area of combinatorics with lots of research going on. One of the biggest breakthrough recently was the work of Adam Marcus, Daniel Spielman, and Nikhil Srivastava: Interlacing families I: Bipartite Ramanujan graphs of all degrees, Interlacing families II: Mixed characteristic polynomials and the Kadison-Singer problem. Also see the web page of this upcoming workshop at Banff: Algebraic and Spectral Graph Theory. A good reference for this topic is the book by Brouwer and Haemers: Spectra of Graphs.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"I came across the proof of irrationality Square root of 2 when I was 13 in a school textbook. The teacher skipped over this portion of the text without even mentioning this. I had acquired a habit of reading the school textbooks on my own as I started feeling cheated by the teachers. So, when I read the proof, I didn't get it. At all! I started replicating it, writing it in my own words, etc. but still there was something bugging me about the proof. Then finally I realized that it was the idea of Proof by contradiction which I was unable to grasp. After a few days when I finally got it, it was a great feeling! The notion of proof was an alien concept which I couldn't find in any other subject but maths. Oh, I also recall a small trick I developed when I was 8 to write down tables quickly. I was quite bad at memorizing them. Then one day, I somehow discovered that to write the table of 13 from the table of 12 (which was easy to remember) by adding 1 to the first multiple, 2 to the 2nd and so on, i.e. the table of 13 is13 X 1 = 12 + 1 = 1313 X 2 = 24 + 2 = 2613 X 3 = 36 + 3 = 3913 X 4 = 48 + 4 = 52...Now, I see that algebraically this simply means that (13x = 12x + x) but back then it seemed like a really cool trick which I used often to show off my speed at writing all the tables from 2 to 20. :)",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"The lemma is basically one of the generalisations* of the fact that a univariate polynomial of degree d has at most d zeroes to multivariate polynomials.Let FF be a finite field of size qq, let n≥1n \geq 1, and let P∈F[x1,…,xn]P \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n]  be a polynomial of degree at most d<qd < q. If PP is non-zero then the number of zeroes of PP in FnF^n is at most dqn−1dq^{n-1}. (Or let SS be a finite subset of an arbitrary field FF, then P has at most d|S|n−1d|S|^{n-1} zeroes in Sn⊂FnS^n \subset F^n.)So, for example the polynomial xy+x2xy + x^2  has five zeroes (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2) and (2, 2) over the field F3\mathbb{F}_3, which is just one less than the bound 2⋅32\cdot3. The first use of this result (it's called a lemma for some reason) was in polynomial identity testing, and it later found application in many other computer algorithms. It also computes the minimum Hamming distance of Reed-Muller codes in certain cases (though this min distance was already known in the 60s). More recently, this lemma was used in the solution of  the finite field Kakeya conjecture by Zeev Dvir's where he also gave a new proof of the lemma. The basic idea is that if a given Kakeya set is smaller than a particular bound then there exists a non-zero polynomial of a small degree that vanishes on the set (by interpolation), which is then proved to be zero on all points, hence giving us a contradiction (by Schwartz-Zippel lemma), and the required lower bound on the Kakeya set. Further Reading: The Curious History of the Schwartz-Zippel Lemma, On Zeros of a Polynomial in a Finite Grid, The polynomial method by Terence Tao, An Alternative Proof of The Schwartz-Zippel Lemma, Two proofs of the Schwartz-Zippel lemma* there are many other generalisations like combinatorial nullstellensatz, Chevalley–Warning theorem and The Lang-Weil bound.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Call a set of lines passing through a common point equiangular if the angle between any two of them is the same. Now, say you want to find out the maximum number of equiangular lines* passing through origin (or any other fixed point) in Rn\mathbb{R}^n. How would you go about?Here is a linear algebra based proof of the fact that there are at most n(n+1)/2n(n+1)/2 equiangular lines through origin, by Tom H. Koornwinder:Let L1,…,LmL_1, \dots, L_m be lines passing through origin in with angle arccos(α)arccos(\alpha) between every pair of them. Pick unit vectors u1,…,umu_1, \dots, u_m on each line. Then we have ⟨ui,uj⟩2=α2δi,j\langle u_i, u_j \rangle ^2 = \alpha^2 \delta_{i, j}. Define polynomials P1,…,PmP_1, \dots, P_m as Pi(x)=⟨ui,x⟩2−α2⟨x,x⟩P_i(x) = \langle u_i, x \rangle^2 - \alpha^2 \langle x, x \rangle. Then we have Pi(uj)=(1−α2)δi,jP_i(u_j) = (1-\alpha^2)\delta_{i, j}, and therefore, these mm polynomials are linearly independent. The space of nn-variable homogenous polynomials with degree at most 22 can be easily shown to have dimension (n+12){n + 1\choose 2}, and therefore m≤n(n+1)/2m \leq n(n+1)/2. *equiangular lines are related to Two-graphs.Some references:Linear Algebra Proofs in Combinatorics?Linear Algebra Methods in Combinatorics by Babai and Frankl",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Some reasons why finite projective planes are significant: They are related to system of mutually orthogonal latin squares. More specifically, the maximum number of pairwise orthogonal latin squares of order n is n-1. The bound is achieved when n is a prime power but is that the only n for which this holds? That's an old and important open problem in combinatorics.  They are related to Steiner system. Read this post by Cameron: Steiner systems. Solutions to some nice extremal problems in combinatorics turn out to be projective planes: De Bruijn–Erdős theorem, graphs without quadrilaterals, Zarankiewicz problemProjective planes are used in design theory, coding theory and cryptography: Error Correcting Codes and Finite Projective Planes, Low-density parity-check codes based on finite geometries: a rediscovery and new results, Linear codes from finite projective spaces, Applications of finite geometry in coding theory and cryptography, Planes, Biplanes and their Codes, Current research topics in Galois geometry, Some low-density parity-check codes derived from finite geometries.Certain substructures of projective planes called ovals and hyperovals have been useful objects for studying some interesting finite groups and designs (among other things): http://www.win.tue.nl/~hansc/mat..., http://cage.ugent.be/~fdc/intens.... The incidence graphs of finite projective planes are important examples of certain extremal graphs. See Heawood graph, Moore graph, Balaban 10-Cage | Visual Insight, and (k,6)-graphs.Some interesting combinatorial results like the friendship theorem which says that ""If in a finite society any two individuals have a unique common friend, then there exists someone who is everyone else’s friend."" can be proved using the theory of projective planes. The notion of Semifield is interlinked with that of projective planes. See Donald Knuth's PhD thesis on this topic. You can also check out some surveys here and here.

Anurag-Bishnoi,"You need to learn the basics of at least linear algebra, abstract algebra and real analysis in your undergraduate years if you want to pursue research in math. So, you can start doing that right now. Pick up a textbook, watch some lectures and solve problems.While doing this you can also explore some topics which interest you. For me, that was combinatorics, graph theory and number theory. For you, it could be numerical analysis, probability and statistics or some interdisciplinary stuff like computational biology, cryptography, machine learning, approximation algorithms, etc. The most fruitful way of exploring these is by finding a mentor, preferably a professor who works in these fields. Summer internships are perfect for this. You can apply to the various summer research programs in India or abroad.After doing all this if you are convinced that research is what you really want to do then you can start looking for places you would like to apply to. India has some good schools for graduate studies in math like TIFR, IISC, CMI, IMSc, ISI, IISER but if you can you should look for schools abroad which have strong faculty in areas you are interested in. It would give you more exposure and generally a better research experience.Now, some tips regarding this maths and computing program at IIT kharagpur:Don't rely on your department courses and teachers to build your interest in maths. There are very few teachers who teach a course properly there. Identify them and avoid waisting your time in bitching about the others.Don't fuck up your grades! Especially in maths courses. It doesn't matter that the only way to get marks in some of the courses is by cramming previous year question papers, just do it! It wouldn't take that much time or effort but having a good academic record can be important when applying to some schools later.When you apply for further studies, recommendations would be one of the most important part of your applications. Unfortunately, the IIT KGP math dept faculty is hardly recognized even in India, if not for the wrong reasons. So, you can't just rely on them for all your recommendation letters. Take up good summer projects under some well known people to compensate for this.Take some courses like computational number theory, graph theory and other maths based courses in the computer science department. Faculty at CS dept teaches them better than the maths dept.Learn how to code. A lot of maths research today, even pure maths, rely on basic computer programming. Your first year programming course would not have taught you much and the computer science courses in maths dept would actually have a negative impact on your programming capability. Take up some online courses on coursera, edx, etc or take electives in CS dept.Try to avoid following one particular ""funda"" given by some seniors. Listen to different opinions, use your brain and make your own choices. It would be very convenient to follow the herd, as most of your batch mates will do, but it would do you no good unless your aim is just to get a well paying job during placements.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"Brief answer: depends on the project you are working on and the part of it (if there exists one) which requires some big computations. Personal experience: Currently, I need to program a lot. I am basically studying a geometrical structure of 63 points (seems small but it isn't small enough to completely rely on brute force) by computing its hyperplanes (a particular kind of subsets of points) and certain integer valued functions on the points which give rise to those hyperplanes. Then I need to study these integer valued functions too which would have some computational part in it. I program in GAP (System for Computational Discrete Algebra) as it allows me use the automorphism group of this structure to aid my computations. A few months back I didn't need to program at all as I was reading and building the related theory. Now that I have a particular direction, I am following it to see where it leads me. In a few weeks (if I am done with the computations and have verified its correctness) I may not need to program at all for months as I'll try to use the data I have to argue about bigger (possibly infinite) structures that contain this small geometry inside.",high,high,high,mid,mid
Anurag-Bishnoi,"The idea of proof and its importance became clear to me in 1st year of college after reading What is Mathematics by Richard Courant (and some other similar books). I could probably write them in a good enough structure but I never really bothered about it till my real analysis course in 3rd year. The lecturer was a brilliant teacher and he insisted a lot on writing proofs clearly. We spent a month studying Dedekind cuts, least upper bound property and related results about real numbers. Proving things like ""Rational Zero = Real Zero"" gave us a lot of practice in writing proofs. So, I guess there were two ""clicks"". One when I understood what proofs are and why they are important in my first year. The next one when I saw the process of turning a mathematical idea into a well written proof in my real analysis course.Edit: my first exposure to proofs was when I was reading a chapter on irrational numbers in my school textbook. I spent hours to understand what was going on in the proof of irrationality of square root of two. Finally understanding it as a kid could possibly be counted as another one of the ""clicks"".",high,high,high,mid,mid
Rajesh-Tiwary-6,"I was a dumb guy in mathematics, no matter how hard I tried i used to suck at it. All my friends were extremely good at it as they used to go to tuition which my parents could not afford. I failed in Class 9th in Mathematics, I was torn and promised myself that I won't sit and cry rather will make an effort.So I started doing something which really helped meI started reading all the solved examples, noted the authors approach of solving questions and practiced similar questions.1 year of this practice and see yourself how I scored :I was All India topper in mathematicsthis score gave me courage and motivation to solve mathI kept the same practice on and in 12th Std i scored :So basically I want to say that a few academic failures are necessary for your life, it shows you where you lack and what you can do to improve yourself.So know where you're weak and promise yourself to practice those areas more and soon you'll be successful for sureThanks for A2A Seema ShahEdit 1 :Seema Shah ma'am there's one more point I would like to add to this answer and that is about a Teacher's role in a students development:I have been teaching myself from quite sometime and I have seen one thing in Indian  teachers which makes me sad :They compare the students with each other.In my opinion every student is different and has a different area of interest. Some are good in arts, some at sports, some at theory while some at practicals, so its a teachers responsibility to identify these traits and encourage it. For example if I scored 100 in maths than if my teachers will rub my marks to every students' face that would be wrong. It will make the other students jealous of me and they will feel bad for not scoring that good and in turn I would feel outcast.Teachers should always compare the marks of the students with their own previous marks to show them how much they've improved/deteriorated and then they can tell them to break their own records, this way they will feel a sense of pride even if they do not score better than the remaining lot.Eg> if I score 60/100 in one exam and other student get 85/100 then comparing these two would be wrong but if I score 70/100 in my next exam then if you compare it with my previous record (60) you can tell me that I am on the right track and have improved and can do much better, this way I will feel good and proud of myself (no matters how much other students have scored in the same exam)I feel a teacher's role is very important in a child's growth and it should be performed with utmost care.",mid,high,high,mid,low

Rajesh-Tiwary-6,"Although I am not sure how much relevent my answer is but would like to share my story I am youngest in my family, being raised by very loving and protective parents and elder siblings, I always took things for grantedI used to get my work done, my clothes ironed and all small things done by my elders.So when I joined College and started staying away from my family, I realised how much they mean to me.After college I got a job in a different city away from my parents,where I did all kind of stuff that single guys do -Stayed up late at night, went to parties/dates, learned smoking and boozing.My parents here were with my sister , who is a very doting daughter and is always there for them (All daughters are like that) , but after her marriage she moved to her  husband's place. My parents were alone and started missing their children.My mother is a housewive and stays at home alone so she needs someone to talk to about how she spend her day, my dad has got busy working hours and hence is not able to give much time to her. My parents used to call me every hour and talk trivia just to hear my voice, I was also alone in a distant place bored of my unorganised life , thats when i decided to move back to my hometown. I raised a transfer request and now I live with my parents, I can not express how happy I am.

Rajesh-Tiwary-6,"Thanks for A2A, what a wonderful question! In my opinion there are both advantages and disadvantages of having elder siblings, here is a list that I can think of as of now- Disadvantages : 01. If you have an elder sibling, he/she will be used as a comparison tool throughout your life - ""Look at your brother, you should learn from him""02. If a glassware/ceramic utensil breaks while playing hide and seek, guess who is the by default curlprit - younger child03. You are considered irresponisble even if you are more responsible than your elder siblings04. In family matters your opinions do not matter much - ""Abhi toh bachcha hai (you're still a child)""05.

Rajesh-Tiwary-6,"It makes you feel blessed.Disclaimer - Poor English ahead (English is not my first or even second language, any suggestions for improvement will be highly appreciated)My mother and father hail from a small town in Bihar, India. My mother never went to school and my father managed to go to college.They never left their town during that phase.My father got selected for Indian Army in 1979 and was transferred to Pune (one of the finest cities in India). My father took my mother along with him. there, they explored the outer world together and explored love for each other.We used to get transferred to different states after every two years. Me and my siblings were born during these transfers.We never had a permanent home of our own, neither did we have permanent friends because getting uprooted from a place and settling to a whole new one never left us with that option, but one thing that was permanent was the way my parents love and respect each other.I have seen times when my father wasn't able to afford any luxuries for my mother, all his income would be spent on educating his 4 children, but my mother would never complain, she would be there for him always. She never demanded anything for her own.Last few days of the month would be very difficult as my father's salary would have been spent completely, I have seen my parents eating from same plate sharing the little food that would be left after feeding us.During 1999 Kargil War (Indo-Pak War) my father was sent to Border for straight 2 years, He used to write letters to my Mom every single day. After reading those letters my mother would get all teary and she would have her dinner only after she has read the letter about my father's well being.India won the war and my father returned safe and sound. He told us the only thing that kept him going was the hope of returning to his wife and kids.After 30 years they finally build their home in the same city where they fell in love, Pune.Now they stay together in this beautiful house and every time I visit my parents, I feel I am out for pilgrimage.I am proud to be born to parents who set a whole new definition of Love for me",mid,high,high,mid,low

Rajesh-Tiwary-6,"I am gay and I loved a straight guy for 8 years. He is my best friend.He didn't have any girlfriend so I was there with him all the time, silently praying that someday he will feel the same way I do.But it never happened, I tried everything to get him attracted towards me, nothing worked.One day I thought about my life's past 8 years and I concluded that I love him so much that I can let him go. So, I did that, he is still my best friend and he still says he loves me the most and we share everything but now I know that he isn't mine.He has been dating a girl from past few months, to be very frank it hurts me a lot but when I see him happy with her I know that I did the right thing.Isn't the happiness of the person you love the most, defines your love?So I’ll not advise you to forget her and move on, rather be there for her, help her.

Rajesh-Tiwary-6,"I'm glad that you asked this because people have misconception about it.Homosexuality is NOT a tradition/disease. Its in your genes. Imagine someone born with brown eye color in a family where everyone has black eye color, does it makes him sick? is it an age old tradition?NOHe's born that way, the only difference is a person discovers his/her sexuality only after attaining puberty as children do not have sexual feelings till they reach a certain age.So there's nothing that triggers homosexuality.I am assuming you (the person who has asked this question) is straight male, so can you tell me when did you first realized you are straight? can you tell me what triggered heterosexuality into you?No, right ?You just know that you like girls but since when you can't exactly tell.Same way gays also can not tell when they started liking boys, they just know.Regarding deprivation of girlfriend wala point, Imagine you had plenty of opportunity to have boyfriends as lot of boys are approaching you, would you turn gay then?Same is with homosexuals.they do not turn themselves to be gay because they do not have opportunities with girls. FYI, I have been approached by more no. of girls for a relationship than all my straight friends combined!So definitely no deprivation of girlfriends either.I hope I have cleared your doubts to some extent.No offence is intended whatsoever.Thanks for A2A",mid,high,high,mid,low

Rajesh-Tiwary-6,"First of all I'm really sorry for your situation but I would start answering this quoting your own words : We have tried many times to stop the relationship. every time we were sad and talk to each other again. If you're unble to end this relationship that simply means your love is strong enough to conquer every obstacle.See, every woman (introvert or extrovert) has to take this risk of going into a new family and adapting a new life, same goes for the men as well.If you marry him, you'll be happy with him thats for sure. There will be some problems regarding language and culture but I guess there is no age limit for learning new language (I know 7 languages).As far as financial matters are concerned, you could get a job after marriage and you both can earn together.All you need is to discuss everything with him, tell him that you're willing to get married to him and see how he wants to take this further.Its either in or out, you can't keep it hangingIf he agrees to be with you, no matter what the situation is, marry himIf he's unsure about the same Leave him ...........................................................................................Just Imagine the situation - You don't marry him even if he's willing to make adjustments for you and you marry someone else with whom you're not happy, won't it kill you to think that you had a chance to marry the man you loved but you didn't just because you were not willing to take a risk? Listen to your heart and do what needs to be done, not everyone is lucky enough to find their one true love. All the best :)",mid,high,high,mid,low

Being a valedictorian doesn't means you'll get a good job, luck is equally important6. ""I love you"" can sometimes be the most dangerous sentence you could come across, trust me.7. Coming out of the closet isn't THAT big deal, nobody cares whom do you choose to spend your life with , all they want is some dirt to gossip8. You're good in studies, pursure engineering/MBBS, Bullshit! follow your dreams, do what you like doing.9. Somebody liking all your facebook profile pictures doesn't means he/she is interested in you, you might just have a pretty face.10. Indian boy who doesn't like cricket is not man enough, crap! Not everyone is born to follow same trend as their peer groups.11. Respect someone JUST because they're elder to you, crap! respect comes from someone's maturity and not age.12.

Bhagya-Shree-D,"This is a bit long and  little confusing incident, but I promise that it is one of the kind. This happened to my quiet, introverted roommate. It was the day before mechanics exam. She being a geek, had prepared everything in advance and was sitting  jobless. (Yeah! The day before exam). There was another geeky, well prepared friend of her's, who too was jobless. And both the jobless people started posting  some  conceptual mechanics doubts in whatsapp,he  clearing her doubts and she clearing his. Suddenly, out of the blue he texted her some heart emoticons followed by, ""i love you "".  This girl asked me what to do. She suspected the guy to be using "" chatur ramalingam policy "" as in 3 idiots movie. ( distract your fellow competitor during exam time.) I asked her to text back, ""I love you, bro "". But she texted him, "" I'll let you know after exams."" The guy's reply proved her doubt. Chatur's reply was -"" hey ! It was a prank. Sorry!. Just checking. "" She replied that she had known it and is sportive about  it. It ended there. We both laughed and I went to another girl's room for combined study, leaving my well prepared, jobless friend. Six months had passed. My friend and Chatur guy, both passed the semester with good CGPA.She had 0.35 more than him ( In the mechanics exam, both had full marks. OMG!) Very recently, when we were in an emotional talking session she told me what had happened that day after I left.  She was pissed at him for playing Chatur policy. She tried playing back a trick. She texted him that she always had a thing for him and was nervous about asking him out. He readily agreed, telling that their relation must not affect their CGPA. Twist ....he fell prey to her prank. But what was happening ? Wasn't that a realization to her that he likes her ? The  so far single, introverted girl was now in a situation knowing he likes her. He thinks she likes him. But her's was prank proposal. It was time for her to end the prank. She said it. But he had actually let out his feelings. ( very confusing. It took me long time to grasp all this from what she said). Things were now a question before her as to accept his love or laugh off as prank. She got confused. She started feeling something for him. Things started off as prank had turned serious. (Mechanics exam next day). He called and told her to focus and not to worry.Next day, after exam he actually asked her out seriously. She replied a ""yes"" seriously. Accidentally they fell in love.We had exam that whole week. So they didn't have great long talks or chats. Just knowing each others' feelings for each other. She told me all this only after six months. There were no signs of them being in love. She kept the secret so well. They don't talk on phone nor have I ever seen her texting really long. They do not meet in real too. He's in a different branch of engineering. ( first years have common syllabus).All these factors sound abnormal in love story right ? She told me that they broke up. I don't know the reasons or how long they were in the relation. But it was her first love that happened, accidently. Only thing I know is that she still misses him, but she never accepts the fact.",high,high,low,mid,low
Bhagya-Shree-D,"I believe that we are born to learn. Every life experience, good    or  bad, comes with a lesson. If we learn to embrace every experience as a lesson, there would be nothing to fret about in life.Lessons from my life :Happiness comes from within:  I believed that, achieving could make me happy. Definitely it does, to some extent. I would postpone my happiness, until my target is achieved. But, that is not how things work. What I learned was, we are all in an illusion that others, with more materialistic achievements are happier than us. Well, happiness has got nothing to do with this. Materialistic achievements guarantee momentary happiness and it gives an ego boost. To be in a permanently blissful state, happiness has to come from within. ​What goes around comes back:  The theory of Karma, actually works. Every good thing or bad thing happens for a reason. The world is a mirror, where every thought, word and deed has a reflection. Our negative emotions on someone, our rude way of dealing someone; all these damage us, not others. To have a comfortable life, it is important to feel good about everything. Goodness brings in more goodness. Lessons from my sibling's life:Never settle down for things and people when you know it is not going right: Adjusting is a good trait. When life does not go as we imagine, we will have to adjust with things. Adjusting well,is an art. But , comprimising your ideals, is not a desired quality. If we have a principle of life, never go against those ideals. When it is known that, someone or something isn't going right, never compromise your ideals and settle for it. All it takes is patience. Let go the bad and wait for a better future which holds people and things deserving you. ​Lessons from friend's life : Life does not always go as planned : This sounds sad. But it isn't actually. When life goes against our plans, it is actually offering us something else, which can make us better and stronger. Sometimes,the unexpected turns in life, makes it more interesting. I would take an example from the bollywood movie Queen. The heroine is initially torn, when her fiance cancels their marriage. That unexpected havoc, turned into a blessing for her. She meets very interesting people on her trip and she blooms out into a confident and better person.Things worked for her better good. Whatever, looks bad and ugly right now, would turn into something meaningful and beautiful later on.Life is understood backwards, but it has to be lived forward. ​",high,high,low,mid,low
Bhagya-Shree-D,"For centuries, we have been living with certain notions. There are certain definitions and standards and society expects us to live by it. There are some characteristics attributed to a man and a different set of characteristics to a woman. When a man or woman fails to live by these definitions, they are given tags. When a man is active and bubbly, he would be called childish. If a woman tries to be friendly with other men, she may be given a slut tag. There can be many other examples, where either of the sex is at a disadvantage1) Tomboy is better accepted than a girly boy.2) Boys who roam at night are considered cool dudes and girls are supposed to sleep at night.3) If a man can't cook well, it is fine, but if a woman can't , she is not a perfect wife.4) If a woman in unemployed and lives with husband's salary, it is fine. But, an unemployed husband is really looked down upon.There are many such notions. We must live our life, for our sake, rather than bothering what society tells. We must not be bothered by these ideals. We just have to do our duties without harming anyone else.",high,high,low,mid,low
Bhagya-Shree-D,"The kaveri delta coal- bed methane extraction project is currently undertaken by a Haryana based private company named GEECL. The project is opposed by farmers as well as agricultural and environmental experts and hence it is currently suspended by Tamilnadu government.The chairman of Centre for Cauvery delta development studies (CCDDS), S.Ranganathan  had said that the delta was a food producing area and there was a vast difference in extracting coal bed methane in a fertile land like Mannargudi and other places such as Ranikunj. S.Janagarajan from Madras Institute of Development Studies said that delta was already vulnerable and production of coal bed methane would damage it further environmentally, economically and socially since methane is worse than carbon dioxide.Dr.Natarajan who participated in hydrological investigations of the delta tells that if 25 years of production phase is allowed, entire groundwater in the zone would be depleted and shallow aquifers would be pumped out in five years or sooner. This would lead to groundwater flow from coastal side resulting in sea water intrusion and salinization. The groundwater depletion can aggravate the livelihood uncertainties stemming from non-release of water from Mettur dam. It would affect food production and livelihood of farmers and farm labourers too.This project is likely to create hydro-geological, socioeconomic and environmental disturbances to the delta which is already facing water scarcity. This can lead to migration of farmers as water refugees.Danabalan and PR Pandian, farmer representatives said that farmers had not been consulted before clearing the proposal.Now a fresh round of protest has begun after Union Minister Arun Jaitley announced in budget that Centre would accelerate methane project. MDMK Chief Vaiko termed the methane project and proposals by Karnataka and Kerala to build new dams as very dangerous to the interests to Tamilnadu, especially Kaveri delta region.",high,high,low,mid,low
Bhagya-Shree-D,"Dear friend, I have been through the same situation as you. While reading your question, I felt like reading some question I would have posted some months back. You have asked for tips for improving yourself. I am writing a long answer and it gets a bit quote kind in between, but read on. :)You must realise that roaming out with friends is not the ultimate purpose of life. But, we are social beings yearning for attention and care, therefore there is nothing wrong if you desire to be with a bunch of good friends.You must really lookout  for a reason, if you think your friends are avoiding you. In many cases it may turn out that your cool nature or attractiveness makes them insecure. (people may be feeling weak before you, so they try to avoid you). Or else it may be that you have some strained relations with some of them or that you are plainly an asshole or a bore. The latter can be fixed, if you put some effort.Be confident and let your friends know that you are interested in meeting them up. Let go your ego and invite them wholeheartedly. They would definitely join you, if you are genuine.Learn not to give a damn. This is easy to say, but tough to follow. You have lived for years without the help of your friends and you can continue living without them. This is not a cynical statement. I am asking you to make yourself, your best friend.Last semester, I lived a sad life; some strained relations and none really to confide to. But, one day I decided to let go all hard feelings. I didn't do anything, but taught myself that this isn't the end of the world. Just like magic, things started changing. My friends started calling and messaging me. I got to hangout with friends from all levels of life, ranging from old schoolmates, entrance coaching mates and present college mates. The last two months of vacation, I must have attended about 7 meet ups for movies, food and beach stroll. I could talk to and forgive people who have hurt me. I apologized in cases, where mistakes were mine. It all felt like releasing the sadness I held for one semester.Realise that people love you out there. Not everyone is using you, nor you need to please everyone. Give up your ego and hard feelings. Call your friends and GO CHILL OUT !!!",high,high,low,mid,low
Bhagya-Shree-D,"In school we had to use pencil till we reach fifth standard. I used to envy the fifth class girls who showed off their fountain pens. Somehow I wanted to finish off fourth standard, so that I could also use a pen.  Pen appeared to be a classy and superior item in comparison to pencil. Now I know that pencil is used when we tend to make mistakes. It gives us a second chance to rectify. A pen thus is a symbol of maturity and class. A person carrying a pen is indirectly telling ,"" I'm no more a kid. I'm not likely to make errors "".  Other advantages of pen are ease of writing and low maintenance. ( requires no sharpening). To use a pencil; we need to carry an eraser and a sharpener. But a pen comes alone. It requires no other accessories. A good pen promises better handwriting. There is a wide range of choice if we speak of pens. It comes in different colors, types and shapes. Pencils differ only in their shades. I agree that they come in different shapes with spiderman and barbie stickers , all for attracting kids. There are more costly and classy pens than pencils. On summing up, pen is a classy and convenient writing tool compared to pencil. Edit - I never knew about pencils costing 38 thousand rupees. Thanks for the comment.",high,high,low,mid,low
Bhagya-Shree-D,"You sound desperate to come out of being single. There is probably peer pressure on you for getting into a relationship. You are actually not in need of love, relation or a girlfriend. You are under a false belief that having a girlfriend can bring happiness in your life. First of all, you must understand that having a girlfriend will not add happiness into your life. People say they are happy in a relation, because, that is when they start feeling good about themselves. So, if you can feel good about yourself staying single, that is the best.  You just need to realise that, having a girlfriend is not the most important thing in your life. There are many other fruitful and productive things to do. Let all girls be your friend. Only then you can actually pause and look for the special one. If you eye every girl with a prospect of being your girlfriend, you will miss out the one really meant for you. Come out of shyness and feel confident. Prioritize goals in life and work for it.

Bhagya-Shree-D,"Well friend, I'm also a very emotional kind of person. I have an expressionless face most of the time and keep a serious look. People think I'm bold, strong and practical. So, they treat me like that. People come to me with their problems, I sort them out if I can. They think I'm free of troubles and have a strong heart, which never breaks. To the outside world, even to many of my  close friends, I'm a strong hearted person who never cries, who has no problems in life and who is well-versed to give philosophy lectures when others are in trouble.Deep down, I keep crying whenever I'm sad. It may be my ego, I cry out only to my mother and may be to one or two others. Sometimes, my mother finds it so hard to bear with my crying( since I hold on to the same problem and cry over it ). I tell her, that she is the only one to whom I let out my emotions. She tells me that I wouldn't need her for that too, if my heart was actually strong. If I was really a strong person, I wouldn't be crying out to her or to anyone else.The first step in having a strong heart is believing you have one. That is what I do with others except my mother. I have projected out myself as a strong willed person. (Fake it till you make it)Avoid situation and people, who may bring you down emotionally. It is hard, but not impossible to let go troubling memories of your past.Believe that, every hard experience in life makes you stronger. This is truth. You may not have realized it. After every storm, you come out as an evolved person and your heart has become stronger.World needs emotional people who can still keep values like kindness, love and care. Being a cry baby is a different thing. Keep this is mind that being emotional is not a bad thing. When channelized properly, you can become an asset to the mankind. Remember that, you can be emotional and strong hearted at the same time.",high,high,low,mid,low
Bhagya-Shree-D,"Most of the answers have mentioned the points that I wanted to keep. Yet again, I am writing them down.Wrong career choice:17-18 is the most deciding time in our life, because that is when we choose our course for higher education. Wrong choice can result in a wrong career and thus an unhappy life. There are people who have recovered from this, by following their passion and succeeding in life. But that requires great skill sets and it is not be possible for everyone to recover from the consequences of this wrong choice.Sacrificing academics : Brilliant and studious students, once into top professional degree, tend to give up academics for various reasons. I have seen JEE toppers failing in various papers. It isn't that they find things hard to learn, but just that they feel that, once in college, one can enjoy out forgetting good marks. This negligence can result in companies chucking them off their list, on account on low GPA and back papers.Falling for wrong people: In early twenties, people tend to get into a relationship. It may sadly be with a wrong person. The situation may  emotionally pull them down. Breakup, makeup, trying, crying, the cycle goes on and on. Many productive people go down in their lives because of sad breakups and depressing relationships. It may be a set back in academics or at the worst drug and alcohol addiction.Addiction : Addiction to anything, good or bad, is bad. Addiction to alcohol, drug, social media, etc is very difficult to recover from. Youngsters misuse their newly gained freedom to indulge in certain activities which may become addictive in future.Mistakes in social media.  I came across this in Quora. ""Three mistakes of my life,WTF, whatsapp, twitter,Facebook"". Social media is a useful tool, when used appropriately. But otherwise, it can be really disastrous. Getting close to dangerous people through chats, sharing intimate pictures, dirty texting etc are all irrevocable havocs. On the name of fun, youngsters do not realize that, they are inviting dangers.Not giving time to family: Youth is time for friends, college friends, girlfriend, boyfriend,Facebook friends and quora friends (:p), but what about family? I believe this is a big mistake that we do. Early twenties, is probably the last few years, you can be there entirely for your parents. Because, in late twenties, after marriage(Indian scene ) priorities are going to shift from parents to spouse and kids. At any cost parents must not be ignored on the name of friends, academics and career.Life is all about learning from mistakes. In the end, all that matters is whether we have learned or not.",high,high,low,mid,low

Bhagya-Shree-D,"I am extremely lucky to have been born in a family, where there is nothing like gender inequality. Girl or boy, we receive  same treatment. Also, I'm from Kerala, a state with a favorable sex ratio. Women are respected in my state.95% women in my family are working women. Even my great great grandmother had been a working woman!!!.In my family, there is no preference for a male child. I never saw anything like male chauvinism except in movies. My father is very supportive of my earning mother and he totally respects her. I have seen them both, having equal say in all matters. Not even once has he ever imposed his opinion on her.Kerala is a safe place for women, (there had been mishaps and crimes) as far as I have seen. I was never even once eve- teased or stalked by anyone on road. I have been out at nights alone( up to 9 pm), I have traveled alone in trains during night. I consider myself lucky, since I never faced any troubles during all this.Only after high school, I came across boys who were really male chauvinistic. There was a boy who had told it so openly that girls are dumb and can't crack IIT, they are inferior to men etc. During GDs in college, we are given topics like, "" Is losing virginity before marriage a big deal "". I found all the boys speaking on this, were focusing only on girl's virginity. Some of them were passing on really male chauvinistic comments and senior boys were supporting them. I hate boys who tell this- "" I can get through this, because I'm a boy"". In India, we need to go a long way. On one level, there is female foeticide, rape, domestic harassment, eve- teasing and multitude of crimes against women. On the other level, there is this nasty thing called male chauvinism. All those male chauvinistic pigs(MCP), are highly educated boys, who if given a chance would write wonderful essays on women empowerment. They would never rape a woman or do any crime against women. Yet, subtly they all feel that women are inferior to men. Men and women are not equal. We are biologically and psychologically very different. But, that doesn't make any one sex inferior to the other. We need to work on gender equality on both the levels.

You will realize this, once you begin socializing.Be approachable- Part of being social is making it easy for people to walk up and start a conversation with you.

Bhagya-Shree-D,"To enjoy being single, the only thing to be done is, not to fret over the fact that you are single and people around you are happy in a relation. There is too much peer pressure on youngsters these days to get into a relationship. Couples around you, couple dance workshops in college, seeing endless number of girls and boys looking into their phones and smiling, friends telling how great their partners are , etc gives us a feeling that there is something wrong when we are being single. A person who is single may undergo ego issues, inferiority complex, pain of an unsuccessful past relation etc. I believe that relationships are overrated. Once you realize this, it is very easy to be happy when you are single. When I look around, I can see many happy couples, sad couples, desperate singles and happy singles. Common factor among happy singles is that, they are all busy people.Keep yourself busy. Everyone knows this, but very few follow this. We all have some jobs right?Either as a student, employee, job seeker etc. Do that part well. Work is worship. Dont search for hobbies, keep doing whatever you are doing. Start learning all that which you are passionate about.Utilize the time productively I believe that a single person gets more time than the other in same working condition, because he/she wouldn't be going for a date, chatting or talking for what seems like infinite hours. The bonus hours must be considered as a gift and used productively.Learn from others The best part of being single is this. You can learn from the mistakes that others commit in a relationship. Observe people around and listen to  them, when they share their stories with you. You will get to learn ugly truths of life without undergoing anything bad. You can also get to learn relationship hacks which would come useful in future.Being single is a happy phase of life, where you get a lot of time and space to mould yourself out.

Bhagya-Shree-D,"It has been seven months, since I entered into my college. Well, in these seven months I have learned so much than what I learned during my entire life. I am basically learning a lot about life, since I joined the college. So, this question is very relevant to me. It is going to be a little long. I was in a very happy surrounding back home. My mother was my best friend. I must say that the world was all rosy for me. Coming to college, I had to be in a hostel. I got adjusted well to the hostel, college and mess food. Even at home, I had habit of managing all my things, so I did not face any issues in hostel.  But, away from home, I realized that life isn't full of rose petals, we would encounter thorns too.The lessons l learned are the following:Let me put the sad truths first:People change a lot. Don't expect your old friends to be the same, they used to be. College can change the outlook of people. So, they wouldn't be following the ideals, you saw them following back in school.People wouldn't care for you, unless you are pretty, popular or dying.  This is the sad truth. I was taught that, physical appearance doesn't matter. But the sad fact is, it does matter a lot. I have seen people being really conscious about their looks and being too much judgmental about others' looks. They would judge people, not based on their work, but just based on their looks.Being too nice makes you vulnerable to getting hurt. Being too nice and trying to please someone can bring troubles in your life. It is better to please yourself first, before pleasing others. I am not telling that one has to turn selfish. It is just this: keep yourself first.Now, the pleasant lessons:Nothing can beat hardwork combined with sincerity and passion. Even if world is unfair to you on many grounds, being passionate and sincere about your goal can bring you on top. We know this point, but college has provided me more examples, to validate this.You can be happy, if you choose it. That is, my happiness is entirely in my hand. Instead of blaming situations or people around, I can work accordingly to keep myself happy. Instead of waiting for any magic to happen, I can turn into the magician and bring happiness into my life.Reading can beat loneliness: My best friend, leaves home every weekend. When not busy with academic work, I have felt really lonely. Being an introvert, I never initiate conversation nor am I into social networking and chatting. Quora had rescued me and some other books too. Reading keeps me busy and I could free myself from depression.These are some lessons, which are neutral to me. They are neither too sad nor too pleasant.CGPA matters. Unless you are a genius, CGPA counts. Even if you are not pretty and popular, you will feel satisfied at the end, if you have a decent CGPA.No matter, how great you are, there are people who are better than you.  This means, you are in a highly competitive environment. There are people who are better than you in some fields, but you are better than others in some other fields. It is important to find that field and work on it.There are many more life lessons, I got to learn.

Everyone were shocked to see her. Worried of losing the reputation of the family, an elderly one suggested to paint the girl,white. Her parents readily greed. They purchased the best quality paint and painted her white until she turned into a snow white beauty. She grew up as a white beauty without even realising she was born green.

She looked at her skin, only to realise that it was green. People around her started giving her weird looks. The innocent girl ran back into her home.She realised the ugly truth, that green was her colour and how much everyone hated it. She cursed herself for being born green. She looked into the mirror and realised that she was beautiful in her own way. She accepted her green skin and smiled in the mirror. She accepted it as blessing of God.

There are female versions of you, in fact a lot of them. There are girls too, who preserve their things for soulmates. There are girls who do not even have a crush in their life, because of their loyalty to their future partners. But what do they do ? They may be shy to meet other men, they may not talk or interact much with men, they may not post a question in Quora like, ""Where do I find my male version ?"". In fact they would be at a greater trouble than you, seeing whatever happens in modern India.  They may be disgusted at the ideas of live-in-relationships, multiple boyfriends, pre-marital sex and many such stuff, which they can't just accept. Moreover, do you believe that the world gives them hope to believe in true love or perfect life partner ? What I mean to say is that, there are female versions of you. But you may miss them out, because they may not take the first move, they may not respond positively to you, they may not be too cool or good looking. She may be the silent girl in your class you never talked to, or the girl who never showed up for any college events or she may have been the nerdy one sitting in the dark corner of library. I'm not telling that all female versions of you are introverts or geeks. May be she is center of attraction in a crowd. But her outgoing nature may give you a feeling that she is not the conservative woman in your mind. It is wrong to believe that girls who have male friends aren't conservative. Summing up: The female version of you is around the corner. Just that you don't know it is her, doesn't mean she isn't there. If you find her out, you are lucky. Never expect her to be perfect. Expect her to be someone who's nature is compliment to your nature. Never feel disheartened when someone tells you that you can't find a perfect match. Nothing is impossible. Miracles do happen.

Bhagya-Shree-D,"In India, 18 is considered as the age of achieving basic maturity. It is at this age most students start staying away from homes( in hostels). If at 15 years one could achieve basic maturity, it is indeed a great thing.  I believe that attaining a matured outlook is extremely beneficial to the person. Being able to handle oneself and help others is very much a desirable trait. Into the future, this experience of handling things independently will come very handy.   But in India, 15 is not a big age. It is  the age meant to sit and study aiming a 10 CGPA in tenth class boards. Parents do not expect kids to earn, deal with finance or date ""properly"" as mentioned in the question. They would not ask a fifteen year old's opinion in dealing bigger things. ( This is the general case , there would be many exceptions ). While taking admission in NIT Calicut, students were taken to a separate hall and asked to fill some forms and attach some certificates. I saw many students who called out officials for helping them in filling the forms. Had they learned mature deals such as filling a form or paying fees, this wouldn't have happened. The question was whether maturity looks good on a 15 year old. I assume that it is about suitability. If a 15 year old is actually doing all the things in the question, his/ her friend may ask, "" My parents do these things for me. Tere papa lazy fellow hain kya?"". Anu aunty next door may tell the parents,"" Why do you let your kid handle big things. My husband pays Sony's fees. Aapka beta bacha hi hain na!""( There are many cases where kids have shown extreme maturity and taken family matters in control and dealt with them intelligently. Hats off to them !)We must remember that 15 year old is not exactly a bacha and he/she  must at least have an idea about what maturity is and how to handle things maturely. It is very much a good thing and a useful thing.",high,high,low,mid,low
Bhagya-Shree-D,"I never watched any superhero movies or read any superhero comics, till I entered into college. I was interested in real life heroes than fictional and fantasy ones.It was in my first semester ,that is about eight months ago, I joined Quora. I got to see a lot of quotes from Batman trilogy and I found them interesting and inspiring. I started discussing about Batman movies with a guy friend and realized that he had a lot to tell to tell about Batman franchise. I decided to watch Batman trilogy.For the first time, I saw a superhero movie and I was amazed at it. I realised that I too can enjoy superhero movies. I saw ""Man of Steel "" and two of the spiderman movies.I guess no one would disagree to the point that, Batman is most inspiring among all superheroes. Among Superman and Spiderman, I found Superman more inspiring; though spiderman is more relatable. Superman, though being an alien, got down to help humans and the element of kindness in him, is adorable. This answer is based on the very few movies, I saw from superman(1)and Spiderman series(2).My answer is not in accordance with the question. BATMAN IS MOST INSPIRING.",high,high,low,mid,low

Bhagya-Shree-D,"The best memories of my childhood are associated with my grandfather, who is no more now. The coolest among them are.The walks to remember: The evening walks through our street, till the nearby river, holding his hands. We would talk about various things ranging from my school feeds to his childhood memories and even episodes of puranas and moral stories.Playing in rain: My grandpa always exposed me to nature. My parents and grandma wouldn't have allowed me to play in rain. But he would come out with me and we would both play in the terrace against the rain drops.Animal kingdom: He exposed me to caterpillars, birds' nests and a lot more. I remember him showing some worm and asking me to hold it. Initially I was hesitant and later on when I tried it, it felt cool. He had taught me that dead cockroaches are to be held with its antennas and dead rats by its tail. He taught me that grasshoppers are harmless and shouldn't be killed. One day, when he saw my repulsion towards lizards, he took wheat flour and shaped out a lizard. He added two mustards as eye beads.(creative right !)I played the whole day with that ""atta lizard"", and I could overcome the lizard phobia. (Still I hate them, but I tolerate them). Another day, I saw a snake and I went to my aunt and asked her to do some ""Nag pooja"", to please the snakes. My grandpa asked, "" Do you think that only humans have the right on this planet? Let other animals and reptiles too be here. Do not intefere in their lives. They won't harm you. Let them be."" Because of him, I do not scream at insects. I am cool with picking up live snails, caterpillars, millipedes, grasshoppers etc. I am indifferent to lizards and thankfully I do not get to see snakes. I get along easily with most cats and dogs. I adore rabbit and birds. I do not mind touching an elephant, cow or goat. I am waiting to touch a lion and tiger.:pMy childhood was cool because of my cool grandpa and his cool nature.

Bhagya-Shree-D,"I keep switching between both- being straight forward and being not so straight forward. Here are the things that happened in my life.I tend to be frank and honest. If I have an issue with anyone or anything, I would confront it directly. I never judged or criticised anyone, but I had faced people on face whenever needed, instead of backbiting. I have lost friends because of being honest. Learning from my lesson, I decided to remain diplomatic. Chucking my honesty, I started being a little fake. I behaved as the angelic girl, who never gets angry, never tells ugly truths and who is full of compliments. I got many friends and I everyone gave me the nice girl title.Later the fakeness became part of my life and later that side became of the real me. But since I was being too nice, people were taking me for granted. Part 3. Now, I switch between both. I am honest and diplomatic. I do not hurt anyone. I say ""no"" and ""don't"" whenever required. I no longer care about what opinion people have about me. I believe that I'm not hated by anyone. I have only few good friends, but they are great quality friends. Because of my straight forwardness, two or three people have distanced themselves from me. But , I believe that they have in fact helped me.

Bhagya-Shree-D,"I smile a little less usually. I have a serious and sober face. People judge me as a serious person and many are a bit hesitant to approach me. Whereas, actually I'm a fun loving person and I do laugh out loud and smile at dear ones. Once people get closer to me, they say that their notion about me was that, I was serious and egoistic and now it has changed. I never felt like changing myself. Because of my neutral face, people do not mess up with me, perverts do not approach me and seniors never ragged me. I was happy being that.Two weeks back, I got a serious leg injury and I could not even walk. I went to a hospital. I was really distressed and feeling very awkward. I had to go in a wheelchair and it felt like the worst moment of all. The whole crowd was staring at me, since I was the only teenager in wheelchair and the rest all were really old and weak people. An old man even came to me and asked why I was in a wheelchair. The pain of the injury was also very high. I wanted to cry, but my ego didn't let me to. In the X- ray room, there was a cheerful nurse who changed my day. What she did was this,  she gave me a beautiful smile. She asked me a few details, all with a very cheerful face. I couldn't do anything else, but, just reply back with a smiling face. At that horrible state too, I felt like smiling, because of her smile. The journey back from X-ray room was much less painful because the positivity of her smile still lingered in my heart. The good news that followed was, my X-ray didn't show any fracture and doctor suggested that a leg bandage would be sufficient.I gave a thought into it. My worst experience could turn so much better, just because of her smile. I started observing people around me and found smiling faces more adorable than serious faces. I may or may not be serious within. But, putting a smile on my face, could bring a lot positive vibration and positive people around me. I started putting some effort into this. Since my usual face is a neutral one, smiling for no reason is still hard for me but it is not impossible, I realized. I learned this too, I can smile and still be free from people who mess around. I can smile and still not invite any perverted guys. I can smile and still get all respect that I would get with a serious face.A smile means a lot to me.

But, mostly we forget to be happy during the journey. We postpone happiness till the destination and never do we care to enjoy the journey.We recursively think of mishaps, hold onto our worries, over plan the future and what not.

Bhagya-Shree-D,"After fourth standard, I had to move to a new city since my mother was getting a job transfer. Since she was likely to get transfer again to other cities, my parents decided to admit me to kendriya vidyalaya(KV). Transfer from one kV to other is quite smooth and it doesn't affect one's studies. There was an entrance exam for non- kV ite student to join KV. I had prepared really hard. I studied for about two months of vacation .There were two KVs , one nearby and other one far away from my house. I gave tests in both. It was pretty easy. I was almost sure of making it. But the problem was that there were only two seats and about fifteen students gave tests at both the places.Since I did not have reservation, I had to come first to grab the seat. In the nearby KV ( let me call it KV-1), I came second. But there was no use. No admission. I lost it. I remember sitting and crying.  A week later, KV-2  results were out. I came first. I had made it. But the issue was this school was really far away from my house. There were no school vans or taxis available. Only option was taking a public transport system as in a bus. This won't sound tough. But I was then a nine year old, thin and weak looking girl, new to the city, with little or no exposure to public transport. My only option was to travel alone. All acquaintances expressed their concerns to my parents about letting a little girl travel alone. But they supported me and said that there is nothing to worry. The long journey in the crowded bus was hard. On the third day, while getting down, someone had pushed me accidently and I fell out of the bus and got a ligament injury. I cried, but I am still grateful for the two teachers who were in same bus and helped me out. Eventually I learned to manage things. I made friends with some regular travellers, bus conductors and some school mates who got into the bus at various other bus stops. Speaking about the school, it was amazing. I began participating in various activities, made great friends and enjoyed a lot. Those were the best days of my life. I met the best teacher in the world there. Sapna Mam, my Hindi teacher is still my inspiration. I still remember all her motivating words. I don't know if she remembers me at all, but I owe her a lot. A year later, I could get KV to KV transfer into KV-1, the nearby one. I could comfortably travel in non-crowded school van. This school too was amazing. I studied there for five years. All these five years went smoothly. What helped me in KV-1 were the lessons I learned in KV-2. Be it motivation of teachers or the rich experience gained out of traveling alone. Had I initially come first in KV-1 during the admission test and joined there, I would never have learned all these life lessons. I would have remained that mediocre person I was before joining KV. I am not claiming that I'm anyone extraordinary, but I know how much I've learned and how much I've grown in this experience. The admission I was denied at first is the best thing that happened in my life. I've learned to accept failure and I know that ""no"" from something means ""yes"" to some greater thing, in fact the greatest thing.",high,high,low,mid,low

We can never understand how lonely they feel without us. They have to celebrate most of the festivals without us. We can happily celebrate here with our friends but think about them. Our presence is the only thing which can make them happy. But, we are not there with them (because of various reasons). It makes them sad but they don't make us realise that.  So, this is the least possible thing we can do to make them happy. Talk to them daily (And don't wait for them to call us every time. Sometimes, you can also call and feel that happiness in their voices).PS: This Diwali, I have planned a surprise visit back home :) (Tickets done.

Dipti-Raj,"I'm your super-super-duper senior. Well I'm not very very old but now in my early 50s. There is a convocation speaker lurking in every old man trying to come out and lecture all the young. Though I'm successful but not so much as I'd get invited to address a convocation. That I intend to do here. Normally I try to avoid dispensing free advice because I know how difficult it is to put it into practice. And there is nothing more depressing than a good advice. But for the time being I can't resist myself. So here it goes..... Despite friends and family, youth is probably the loneliest period of life. But it is the most exciting and can be a greatly satisfying period of life. Try not to plan too much and don't worry too much. Every week keep asking yourself ""Am I anxious? If yes, why so much? What is it that I'm so anxious about?"" Confront the problems in your life head on. Don't ever forget that it's not so much money, material and achievements that make your life but the people around you and your relationships with them. But never underestimate the importance of money. It'll always be the most helpful and the best friend of yours. So always have some amount of it saved with you. Try to gain independence in thoughts and actions as much as possible in your life. Preserve your self respect. You'll meet a lot of people in your life. It'll never be possible for you to build permanent relationships with them except very few loved ones. Sometimes you would lose your loved ones. Some will betray your trust and hurt you. But remember nothing stops the flow of life. They say, ""The show must go on!"" I say ""The show will always go on, with you or without you!"" So don't stop anywhere. Develop a healthy distrust in people but also learn to trust the right people at the right times. Nobody is good or bad all the time.You may find the cruelest and ruthless ones doing kind acts and the kindest and the best doing cruel things. Don't get perturbed by it. Life is paradoxical and so are people. You are also one of all the people. Love someone. Deeply and violently. It will elevate you. Will give meaning to your life. Lest life is meaningless. If it ever happens that you open your eyes some day and find that the world is lot more horrible place than you ever imagined , don't weep. You will find solace in your love. So find someone and love him/her more than yourself. That will give you enough reason to stand up to the horror , cruelty and ruthlessness of the world. Always be loyal and helpful to your family, your brothers, sisters and cousins. No matter who says what, the ones who are related to you by blood will always be more closer to you than anybody else. Take care of your health and your body. Don't drink too much and don't smoke. It will greatly reduce the quality of your life in later years. Have a steady and balanced lifestyle. Draw some sweat from your brow everyday. You will reap its benefits for all your life. Don't let your work eat completely your life. Give yourself and your family some time. Have fun. It's not a crime to have fun and to be happy. The greatest regret that most people have at the end of their lives is that they worked too hard and never gave themselves enough time to live life fully. Don't ever compare yourself with others. Believe me, you are far too special than anybody else in the world. Don't spend your life to be someone else. It's your life. Take control of it. What else can I say. If I were to leave a note behind for my son and daughter, before passing away, I wouldn't change a word from above. If you are still reading patiently all that I have written above, I want to make a last point. This is the gist of what I have learned all through my life.

Dipti-Raj,"It's not a story. Its about my recent experience.I was in Saudi Arabia for 3 months at a university for my summer internship. Before visiting there, I had never met any people from Pakistan and I don't know why but I (I think many others too) had a perception of all Pakistanis either being a idle or involved in some terrorist activities. But, at that university, there were a lot of people from Pakistan involved in maintenance jobs, at the stationary shops, at the diner where all the students and professors used to have their breakfast, lunch or dinner. The first day when I went to the diner for my lunch, at the food serving area, I saw an Indian looking guy in 30's. He was the first Indian (I though) I met there and so I was very happy.To start a conversation, I asked him: Kaha se ho sir aap? (Where are you from, sir?)(expecting answer like Punjab, Tamil Nadu or any other Indian state) To my surprise, he said: Pakistan, Lahore.I was seriously amazed at that moment. It was my first meeting with someone from Pakistan. So, I asked a bit more about him/his family/for how much time he was working there/does he miss his family and all these. He sounded (and was) of very good nature and told me to call him anytime if I need any help there. There I realised, for the first time that they are also very hard working people and are no different then us. My perception for Pakistan and Pakistanis completely changed. Everyday, I used to meet him at the diner, greet him as hello bhai..kaise hain (It would feel myself being in my own country in a foreign land). And the day I was leaving from Saudi, he was very sad and told to come again as a full-time student there, if possible.At the end, I would only say, they are no different then us.

Dipti-Raj,"Thanks for A2A.As I write this, I assume that you are not an Indian and as you are asking about marriage, I will also assume that you both have been in the relationship (LONG DISTANCE) for some time, know each other well, have love, commitment, trust and faith.  (Without these, the chances of marriage are even lower, also cosidering the LDR)OK. I would say your chances of you both getting married depend on different factors. Well, it depends on a lot of factors because marriages in India are not just a single person's call. It involves a lot of other matters. The main two issues which I think are : 1) The family issue : It is better to tell him(at the soonest) to ask his parents ""what his parents think about you both getting married"". If his parents approve it, then its all ok. But if not, ""is he ready to marry you without the consent of his parents""?2)  Different Cultures : As the cultures and traditions of the two countries might differ to a great extent, it is better to talk (and decide) about where you both are planning to get settled after marriage. I fear it might be difficult for a woman of a different country with completely different cultures to settle in India. So, better decide about this too.At the end, I would add that it is better to talk with him about these things and any other issues which might come up in your mind. Because, getting married is a big decision for both of you. So, talk, think and then decide.I wish the best for both of you !!Thanks.",mid,high,high,low,mid

Don't just quit. Face it man.Some good suggestions are already here. I would request you to follow these.Consult your seniors for academic help (books, notes, any other suggestions). I know the seniors at IITs are very supportive and also they will not need any kind of party from a junior for helping.They might be making fun of your economic condition.The best way to end this is be a maggu. Start studying very hard.Once you will start doing good in your academics, they will always come back to you (for help in their studies before exams!!). I believe this might make you feel better.Regarding friends, I would say if they are (really) making fun of you, you should understand they aren't someone whom you can call a friend!!! And I also don't believe that all the people surrounding you are like those. You just need to find a company of better, understanding people.Don't say that you don't have friends. If you don't find one in your college, its not bad to be alone (in a contructive way !!). Make friends around the world in quora, facebook. Talk with them, share your feelings.

Tejas-Lad-2,"Well, being a hardcore cricket fan, I always like to analyse these stuffs. I have come up with few points.Rahane to open along with RohitShikar Dhawan has been out of form lately and in spite of being exceptionally talented, has performed below par. So, I would like to see Ajinkya Rahane open with Rohit Shrama. Ajinkya Rahane, one one end is good at rotating strikes and Rohit can play aggresively. This will also allow Virat to come at his usual number 3 position thus benefiting both Rahane and Virat.   2. MS Dhoni at number 4 Well, the old Dhoni we knew was hard hitting batsman and this his number 6 position was justified. Considering his recent performances, it can be clearly seen that he has been finding difficult to hit the balls hard but easy to rotate strike. With Ajinkya Rahane at the top, MS Dhoni gets a vacant spot at number 4 and owing to his current style of playing, he can easily fill that spot.  3. Number 5 - 8These positions are the major causes of concern for the Indian team right now. At these positions we need a good wicket keeper batsman (So that Dhoni's pressure gets reduced as well as an emergency backup) , 3 All rounders (One spin, one fast and other either) so that batting has good depth and we have 6 bowlers in the line up. 4.

Tejas-Lad-2,"Being a member of Gopali Youth Welfare Society[GYWS], I would like to write about it. Pardon me for the long answer.Gopali Youth Welfare Society  is a registered non-governmental voluntary organization, primarily managed by the students of Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, with the support of faculty members and local social enthusiasts.The most beautiful thing in the world is to see children smile. Next is to know that you are the reason for that smileAs it is with most part of Bengal villages, condition of villages near IIT campus is really bad in terms of employment, education, health and many other factors. Thus GYWS was formed back in 2002. With our prime focus on Education we are managing an English medium school in nearby village with beneficiaries of around 200 village children who are getting free education also they are provided with school uniform, notebooks and rest required materials. Just to clarify we don't go and teach them but we manage school including teacher’s salary, staff salary, funding for the students uniform, notebooks and everything. We collect funds from industries to help this school grow. Some of our initiatives:1. Jagriti Vidya Mandir [JVM]:An English-medium school in Gopali, which aims to provide quality education to children from underprivileged backgrounds. Established in 2008, the school currently has around 200 students studying from Nursery to Class V. Started initially in a leased building, the school has since moved to its own permanent campus, which shall gradually be developed into a hostel-cum-school campus with classes up to XII.2. Child Labour Rescue:Child labour has been a prevailing issue in Kharagpur for many years, and so a team of GYWS members took the initiative to rescue children working in various canteens in the area. The rescued children have been enrolled into nearby government schools, and all expenditures of their education are borne by GYWS. The Society constantly keeps track of their progress in school and maintains contact with the children and their families.3. Paperkraft:This project is aimed at providing employment and empowerment to rural women, under which women from Gopali are trained to make paper bags from old newspapers, which are sold in the market, and the revenue is then given to the women in return. The old newspapers are collected from the IIT hostels by student members of GYWS.4. e-Samadhan:This project is aimed at providing support to the rural populace in availing government schemes and enquiring about the status of their applications and requests to government offices. Any person can file their grievances at one of the e-Samadhan counters, and a dedicated team of GYWS.

KGP BloodConnect It was realised by us that whenever there is a requirement of blood, many people are willing to donate blood but due to some or the other reasons communication gap becomes their barrier and as a result prompt help doesn't reach to the patient which is very essential in case of an emergency.GYWS and Student Welfare Group, IIT Kharagpur , thus, jointly began this initiative to ensure that any person in need of blood in case of an emergency finds a suitable donor at the earliest. A number of volunteers have signed up to be ready to donate blood when the need arises.Some of our Achievements:Our Society has successfully rescued 12 child labourers till now, who are all currently enrolled in local government schools.GYWS has been empanelled in the National CSR Hub by Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS).GYWS and its activities have been showcased on a number of platforms. The Society had a stall at the PAN-IIT Alumni Meet in December 2012, and at the arena of Spring Fest, the annual social & cultural fest of IIT Kharagpur.Media Coverage:1.

Vishal-Katyal,"Diamond-Water Paradox or Paradox Of Value.This is a solved paradox presented by the economist Adam Smith in the 1700's. Water which is essential to life is so much cheaper than diamonds, which are not essential. But why?Why does an economy put a much lower value on something vital to sustaining life compared to something that simply looks shiny and sparkles?The answer lies in the understanding of the word ""Scarcity"" and ""Marginal Utility"". Scarcity is excess of human wants over what is required to satisfy these wants. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction or gain someone gets from using or purchasing an additional unit of a particular good or service. The total utility derived from water is very high, but for most of us, the marginal utility of water is very low. We can consume as much water as we want, so the extra utility derived by the extra glass of water is very low. In contrast, the total utility derived from diamonds is much lesser than that derived from water because we consume so few of them. Consequently the marginal utility of diamonds is much higher than marginal utility of water.It is marginal utility, not total utility that determines the price. The higher marginal utility of diamonds is then associated with the higher price of diamonds. Note that if we were in a desert, the marginal utility of a glass of water would be huge -- and no doubt we would prepared to pay a very high price for it!Demand is only half the story! Price is also determined by supply. Very few diamonds are produced, so even if the demand for diamonds is lower than demand for water, the price of diamonds could be still higher. The supply of water in a desert is very low too and so the price of water would be much higher than normal in a desert.Reference :- Paradox of value and Diamond-Water Paradox in Economics: Definition & Examples - Video & Lesson Transcript | Study.com",mid,mid,low,low,mid

Me :- Yeah, I was busy in my studies for a while. How you doing? How's studies?Cousin :- School is good. Ten minutes passed. We walked in the park without a single word spoken by each of us.

Her family was a modern one and so they agreed. When they went to the boy's family for the marriage, the decided to approach an astrologer as to how their marriage life will be.Astrologer :- Jii dekhiye, bass 11 gunn mil rahe h (Only 11 planets are in favor of the marriage)Her Father :- Ji hum aapko soch kar batate h ( We will let you know about the marriage )After one day, her parents called the boy's parents and denied the marriage stating the astrologer's hideous predictions. She was in tears and so was he. She discussed about this to her friend X and X decided to sort the issue.Chahat invited his boyfriend's parents to her house and they had a get together with her parents. She also called X who also accompanied themX (to Chahat's father) : Sir, suppose Ranbir Kapoor (A very famous and smart actor in bollywood) came to your house and asked for marriage with your daughter, what would be your decision?Father (Surprised) :- I will see if my daughter likes him or not, and if she does then I will be grateful to marry my daughter to him.X :- Would you ask a astrologer before the decision?Father (after thinking a lot) :- Umm, YesX :- Now sir suppose the astrologer says that he is not compatible for your daughter, would you marry your daughter to him? Think about the lavish lifestyle your daughter will live. Audi, BMW, Gucci, A lavish big house and what not. She will be a queen. Now answer my question, sir. Will you still go with the views of astrologer?Chahat's father was numb on hearing this and couldn't reply to X.

It is so much fun to just relax in your bed doing your stuff and do not care about the outside world.They speak when its needed. They do not spoil others' ears with chatter-boxing and do not waste their words. They speak carefully.They do not like to take life advice from loved ones but they appreciate life advice from a stranger! Normally, they do not like to be given advice.They do not like to be talked about. They work in peace and do not tell anyone about their work. They are too good at keeping secrets. They admire the people who are close to them and thus never break their trust. They are not shy for useless parties. Its just not their stuff!You can always tell them a problem and they will end up giving you so many solutions, even when they do not know much about the problem.They normally stay at home watching television, playing games, reading, studying or visiting social networking sites like Quora.Cons :-They are usually not given what they want.

Vishal-Katyal,"Reasons for reservation system in education in India :-People are living in the 20th century but still are hypocrites who judge people on their castes and not their knowledge.People have a deep incite thinking that the reserved categories - SC/ST and OBC are poor. HELL NO. It is never like that! Some of them are so rich that they have undue advantage of reservation system.The government is right now only thinking about the ""poor reserved people who cannot have advantage of education"" but they are not thinking of ""rich reserved category brats taking unnecessary advantage of reservation"". Fine. Help the poor but why helping the rich reserved ones? They are spoiled brats living on their parents money. They do not want education because if they did they would never require to take help of these systems. Education is a RIGHT and not a PRIVILEGE. This is indeed true too but the reservation system supports it in a vicious way!The political parties do not like to loose in the coming elections. Why would they remove reservation? Some of the ways to minimize the impact of Reservation System :- Giving advantage of this system to only the poor ones. This could be ensured by restricting to give the benefits based on their salary status.

Vishal-Katyal,"Patidar Anamat Sangarsh Samiti (PASS) has organized a rally on August 17, 2015 in Gujarat demanding reservation rights for all or for none. There are various causes which has led to this and I think this rally cannot single-handed abolish the reservation system. Alpesh Kathriya, PASS convener has said that they don't need the support of political parties rather they're welcoming the support of some social leaders. But this is it? No, not at all. The political party in power needs to be influenced as to make changes to convert the Patel (Patidars) into OBC and make them eligible for the reservation system. Effect so far :- As per the TOI, there are significant transfers of police officers in Gujarat after the Patidar agitation has started. State Government on Tuesday has transferred 65 Deputy Superintendents of Police so far. And mind you all of these police officers are the Patel's (Patidars). Not only this, the most significant and the most promising thing to see here is that the out of these transfers young women police officers of the Patidar community got transferred to some of the most important posts. How good is this? :- I personally think that it is a brave step taken towards the reservation system. But is it involving everyone? No. It includes only those who're of the Patidar community. There are two sides of the same coins. It is either totally abolishing the reservation system or abolishing only for the Patel's.

Okay, lets not talk about things for a while. Staying alone in your room is so much fun. Just sit back and relax. Think about the good times you had with your friends and family (even if they have left you alone.) Think how you were enjoying on that vacation with your cousins. Think about the outings you had with your few best friends. Internet :- There is so much stuff on the web. Gain knowledge on any topic you like. I do this very often when I'm alone. Very often. This will help you in two ways --                                                                                 Helps you increase your knowledge.                                                          Helps you pass time by doing something productive.Music :- Alone?

Just read and read. After all, A book is the man's best friend. Walking/Workout :- Go for a walk in a park but without headphones. See the nature. Smell the fresh air.

Vishal-Katyal,"The basic ""fucking"" theory behind false rape claims is pretty simple and complex at the same time.Lack of Investigation :- People blindly trust anyone, when he/she is raped. Yes, if you are raped, then you should be given support and the guilty should be punished. But, strictly because of getting so much of hospitality, money and support because of getting raped doesn't mean you should charge the other as a rapists. I read the second article in the above question where the guilty had just hold her hands because of a fight on money, and he is accused of being a rapist. Has he raped you? Do you have any proof that he raped you? But, hell yeah your tears and a mere false explanation can give you sympathy of being raped.Do you know how the non-guilty feels like? :- No, not at all. If anyone touches you by mistake in a crowded bus you call the cops. He didn't hold your hand neither did he had any intentions. A person committed suicide in Indore being accused of a false rape. He was so ashamed what the society would think of him, that he committed suicide.Too much sympathy :- Many people will offend this. Due to the ongoing rapes everywhere the whole world has become more and more sympathetic towards the raped. Yeah you should be sympathetic and you should support him/her, but after knowing the whole scenario that whether he/she is raped or not. False rapes are not to be answered only by feminists.

That's it.You really don't crave for anyone's company if they don't have time for you.

I strongly offend these people who blame women when it is not their fault. Ques:- Why are some Indian men blame the girl if she is raped? Ans :- These some Indian ones include 90% of old males.

Ques :- Why is female infanticide so common?Ans :- To tell you sir, the ratio of female infanticide has reduced from that compared to ten years earlier but this ratio should reach zero. And this is not happening. The reason behind this is the same philosophy of men being preferred over women. They want boy over a girl but they don't realize that the one who gave birth to that BS boy was also a girl once.

Our city is filled with persons like chain-snatchers, rapists and ""keen observers of women"" type of people. Because of some men being like this, the whole gender ""Male"" is at stake.

He was aged 33. He would be earning like this till his retirement at age 65. The total amount which she lost because of his death is = 18*32 = 5.76 crores.

Vishal-Katyal,"Lets talk about random things in India which will relate to the Question.India is full of people having different cultures and castes. However, we Indians claim ourselves as ""EQUAL"", but we are not. We are divided in castes. Castes means upper castes and lower castes. So, people of India taught me that you can be discriminated even in a democracy.India is a place of integrity. We live in a place of togetherness and moral values, but we break them too which we should not. So India taught me how to break rules while sometimes following it.Food. Indian food is just so tasty that you can't resist but eat it all, especially the street food. So India made me a foodie.We Indians believe in God to the utmost extent that we have made endless donations in some of the various big temples of India. On the other hand, their are various people who are below poverty line. So India taught me to believe in God and his principles by keeping its disciples poor because of huge spending on God.In India we claim a women as ""LAKSHMI"" (Goddess) of the house. But on the other hand you find some bastards killing girl child and doing gang rapes to a girl. So, India taught me to disagree with its own views by respecting women on one hand and disrespecting her on the other.",mid,mid,low,low,mid

The driver was around in his 40's.  We Indians have Hindi as our mother tongue and is usually spoken by every person in day to day life. We didn't expected a reply what we got from the driver.Driver (to my mom) :- Yes, mam where can I drop you?We were stunned for a minute and then mom replied to him conveying the address. Surprisingly, the driver came out to be a complete extrovert.Later on the signal, a biker jumped the red light.Driver :- kya hoga aise logo ka?

Completely stunned*Mom :- Is your wife working?Driver :- Yes, she works in a firm. (I don't remember the name of firm)Now, you must be thinking that why am I a rickshaw driver. Haan?Mom :- No, why would I. (Still stunned)Driver :- Mam, to tell you I have a B.tech degree from ""XYZ"" University. But due to some family problems, I have to work as a driver.

Vishal-Katyal,"Some parents are just too much to pressurize their children. I have seen some people who said me that their parents reply like they have done an obligation on them to raise them up in life. However this trend is slowly diminishing.The psychology which I assume is that parents want their children to deal with the same situations with which they have dealt in their childhood. It is somewhat found in every parent. An example of this is : If you are a boy and while you are sitting on the bed after your 12th boards and enjoying your holidays, your dad comes to you and says, "" When I was in 6th class, I used to sit on the shop and help my father."". So is this my fault you suffered like this? This is what they do.Now, I assume you have surveyed only Indian parents and yeah the mentality of the parents who were raised in 60's or 70's is somewhat like this only. They are still supporting their parents who mentally tortured them in childhood and this is what they expect from us too.They are not seeing that the time in which they were raised and the time in which we are raised is different!",mid,mid,low,low,mid

Shivansh-Mishra-3,"I'm pretty shocked no one here mentioned banker turned writer turned dance show judge Chetan Bhagat's legen...wait for it ....dary novel.Yep I'm talking about Half Girlfriend.The novel is undoubtedly his worst. Based on rustic Madhav Jha's antics at St. Stephen's College ( where he got into via sports quota) and his desi       love story with the daughter of one of Delhi's bigshots , our author really got creative .( Somebody please sing Uptown Girl by Billy Joel to Mr Bhagat , so he realises he's lagging 40 years behind). Also , our hero is pretty obsessed about kissing.(So much so, it seems like the only thing on his mind)But that's where the cliché ends.Sadly.( Weird, but true). Mr.Bhagat , showing off his creative skills , weirdly twists the 'Story'  , with the rich gal leaving the poor ( literally) fellow heartbroken , after she discovers his 'true' desires. Fast forward a little , our little Romeo still craves for the rich gal and finds her ( astonishingly ) in Patna. Now instead of having 'happy ever after' ending , the rich gal teaches our Hero English usage ( that escalated quickly). From here the story just goes downhill with the protagonist's mother taking up the villain's role in their one again budding relationship( Saas, Bahu aur Saazish) and the story  finally ends on a teary note ( So ,Romeo and Juliet it is).So , all this crap along with the author's unappealing way of writing make for a perfect waste of 260 pages of paper.The real surprise is that it was the Best seller in Indian novels of 2014.All in all , a perfect MASTERPIECE.",high,mid,mid,mid,high
Shivansh-Mishra-3,"Okay , since you say there are about 40-50 active nations and there aren't many minnows ,let's assume the year to be 2040.Now let's analyse whether India would still be a top side.First case : No  Unlike popular belief this may well be true. After all there are at least 25 sides capable of beating the other at will , in such a way that it wouldn't be called a surprise or luck. So India will probably be just another side in the game. A comparison could be mmade to Uruguay when the FIFA World Cup was still in it'd early stages. Uruguay were one of the best teams along with probably Brazil and Russia. But now in 2015 ,they have been reduced to a competitive side with not many accolades to show for themselves. Also we may compare the team to our own Field Hockey team of the old. Now we are just another top tier hockey team. Plus if we assume the entry of Germany or maybe France into competitive cricket ,these teams may have a fitness advantage .Second Case :Yes This too is equally probable. I say this as Indian cricket has been constantly evolving and innovating the sport.Unlike Hockey and Football we have no problem with sporting gear and good coaches. The Indian crowds too are the most passionate and this removes the problem of lack of interest.Finally I would say Time is key. If the current brand of cricket goes on then we stand a good chance of being a top side in the competitive cricket sphere ,which I wish comes fast.",high,mid,mid,mid,high

Kiran-Kumar-Pasam,"Source: HP Senior technical executive, Chennai.Once I consulted HP service center as I was facing a problem with my battery of HP Pavilion laptop. I learned that my battery life time is over from a senior technical person.[Sounded knowledgeable to me when I observed him talking to other customers]. So I had put this question to him:How to ensure a better and efficient battery life?He goes like this...Battery life time depends on its capacity and in layman terms it called life cycles[LC], one LC = battery charge from 0-100.Meaning if you drain out a fully charged[100%] battery power completely then the battery is said that consumed a LC.Ideally for any laptop battery [6 shell], its ranged around 500-600 LCs. when it reaches that limit, battery duration starts slowing down.When asked about a new battery usage guidelines, he suggested me to drain the new battery to below 5% [probably 1-5%]  and then keep it for full charge[100%] for the first time, this way you will kind of calibrate the new battery's power and configure it's capacity.A device should be turned off while charging. This allows the battery to reach the threshold voltage unhindered and reach a low saturation current when full. A parasitic load confuses the charger.               -Basic to Advanced Battery Information from Battery UniversityAnd for better efficiency : Do not drain battery frequently below  30%.Use with a charger plugged-in if available [in case of Laptop]Use sleep for short breaks and hibernate for long breaks [in case of Laptop]Dimmer screen brightness if not required.Close/ kill unused processes.Not to use the device in low battery conditions.Wrote this as it has useful points for generic battery efficiency irrespective to a phone/ lappy.",high,mid,high,low,low

Kiran-Kumar-Pasam,"Suppose that there is a building with 100 floors. You are given 2 identical eggs. The most interesting property of the eggs is that every egg has it’s own “threshold” floor. Let’s call that floor N. What this means is that the egg will not break when dropped from any floor below floor N, but the egg will definitely break from any floor above floor N, including floor N itself.For example, if the property of the eggs is that N equals 15, those eggs will always break on any floor higher than or equal to the 15th floor, but those eggs will never break on any floor below floor 15. The same holds true for the other egg since they are identical.These are very strong eggs, because they can be dropped multiple times without breaking as long as they are dropped from floors below their “threshold” floor, floor N. But once an egg is dropped from a floor above it’s threshold floor.Here is the puzzle: What strategy should be taken in order to minimize the number of egg drops used to find floor N (the threshold floor) for the egg? Also, what is the minimum number of drops for the worst case using this strategy?Remember that you are given 2 identical eggs which both have the same exact threshold floor.Of course, I was rejected because of this question.

Dad told me 'The bus was full with only one seat left and the driver was in a hurry and said can't wait and pulled off.'[and the vacant seat was a co-driver seat, the one that's right next to the driver, usually cleaner sits there]So I waited and got another bus and left to Bangalore.While I was on my way to Bangalore, there was a huge gathering of people and roads were blocked and all vehicles took another route to bye-pass the traffic.I could barely see from the window why such gathering out there and all I could make out from that was it was an accident.[But, I dint know it was the same bus that I missed]The same day at office I was browsing through some news online and ITS THE SAME BUS that I missed.Then I realised that it's not he bus that I missed but it's the death.**goosebumps for a minute**Just felt that I was the luckiest on the earth that day!Five killed in road accident near HoskoteFrom then till now, I never neglected urination!Peace!",high,mid,high,low,low

Kiran-Kumar-Pasam,"a heart touching one !A wealthy lawyer was riding in his limousine when he saw two men along the roadside eating grass. Disturbed, he ordered his driver to stop and he got out to investigate.He asked one man, ""Why are you eating grass?""""We don't have any money for food,"" the poor man replied. ""We have to eat grass.""""Well then, you can come with me to my house and I'll feed you,"" the lawyer said.""But sir, I have a wife and two children with me. They are over there, under that tree.""""Bring them along,"" the lawyer replied.

Kiran-Kumar-Pasam,"Feel happy.Arranged marriages are mutual, practical and works more with minds rather than hearts, so don't take it to your heart at first place. Either parties should be okay with each other and then only it's called an arranged marriage. What if match is fixed with a compromise. That will surely evoke discrepancies in later married life. Instead, waiting for a right match is totally and absolutely worth.Let's think it other way, what if you reject a person. Does that mean the person is unfit? No. It's just that he couldn't meet your expectations. Same thing with you, may be his/ her expectations are different from what you are. May be it's the case that you're over qualified and they might have rejected you.TO DO:1. Try to figure out the reason behind rejection.2. If it is something you can do to overcome the situation[Fairness, fitness, shy etc..], attempt to make it better, just do it, don't think much, it's gonna help you.3. If the reason for rejection is not in your control [Financials etc.]and you can't do anything about it, then why is your worry? Just wait for the right one.4. Don't be in a hurry to get married, after all it's about choosing a life partner.5. Define some expectations for yourself in the bride/ groom, you too have choice to reject/ approve.6. If got rejected, think it's not for you. You deserve better.Good luck !",high,mid,high,low,low
Kiran-Kumar-Pasam,"What are hiccups?Hiccups occur when a spasm contracts the diaphragm, a large sheet of muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. This spasm causes an intake of breath that is suddenly stopped by the closure of the vocal cords (glottis). This closure causes the characteristic ""hiccup"" sound.What causes hiccups?A very full stomach can cause bouts of hiccups that go away on their own. A full stomach can be caused by:Eating too much food too quickly.Drinking too much alcohol.Swallowing too much air.Smoking.A sudden change in stomach temperature, such as drinking a hot beverage and then a cold beverage.Emotional stress or excitement.How long do hiccups last?Hiccups usually stop within a few minutes to a few hours.Hiccups that last longer than 48 hours are called persistent hiccups. Hiccups that last longer than a month are called intractable hiccups. While very rare, intractable hiccups can cause exhaustion, lack of sleep, and weight loss. Both persistent and intractable hiccups may be a sign of a more serious health problem and must be checked by a doctor.There are many known causes of persistent or intractable hiccups, including:Central nervous system problems, such as cancer, infections, stroke, or injury.Problems with the chemical processes that take place in the body (metabolic problems), such as decreased kidney function or hyperventilation.Irritation of the nerves in the head, neck, and chest (vagus or phrenic nerve).Anesthesia or surgery.Mental health problems.How are hiccups treated?Most bouts of hiccups go away on their own within a few minutes to a few hours and do not require any treatment.Many home remedies are used to treat hiccups. Most of them involve increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the blood, which usually stops hiccups. Some of these remedies include:Holding your breath and counting slowly to 10.Quickly drinking a glass of cold water.Eating a teaspoon of sugar or honey.The treatment for persistent or intractable hiccups depends on the underlying cause of the hiccups and may range from medicine toacupuncture or hypnosis. Sometimes several treatments may be tried before persistent or intractable hiccups are controlled. If you have hiccups that last a few days or longer, your doctor may conduct tests to rule out a more serious problem.Who is affected by hiccups?Hiccups affect males more often than females. Hiccups occur in practically every human being, including babies and older adults.",high,mid,high,low,low

I was on my bike humming and riding slowly. I noticed a biker ahead of me, it was a three-wheeler Scooty, on which a middle aged physically challenged guy riding with his wife sitting behind. As she was on a saree, she was sitting one sided. She was not sitting properly so she slipped and fell down from the running vehicle.I pulled over my bike road side and rushed to her and helped her get up and asked to sit and offered some water[bottled water in my back pack]. Her husband turned over his bike and came back to us, was furious and angry over his wife and started scolding in Tamil [his native language] for not holding him proper. As I know Tamil, I switched from Hindi to Tamil and asked him to drive slow and careful as the road is full of potholes.Now, here is the strange part:All at a sudden his furious red face turned bright and happy, and was looking at me with wide eyes as if he was seeing an Alien speaking in his native language.

Kiran-Kumar-Pasam,"Although I google the below content, I feel few small scale companies are innovative too.. like ID [Instant foods, dosa/ idly dough, ready to make parota, ready to make rava idly..] Bindu Jal Jeera soda, OLA cabs..]1. UNIQUE IDENTIFICATION AUTHORITYFor amassing a trove of biometric identification to activate benefits for millions of Indians. The government office is using multimodal biometrics—fingerprints, iris scans, and photographs—to build the world's most ambitious identity database. A mammoth ecosystem of agencies deploys its open, scalable model, and the robust system can enroll the identities of a million people a day with 99.99% accuracy. It authenticates people over a mobile phone network using a one-time password or their fingerprints (illiteracy is a problem in India). In the process, it enables instant, paperless provisioning of banking services and welfare benefits to millions of Indians who lacked any identification until now. At last count, 450 million Indians had received their new IDs and used them to make 40 million cash transfers. Read more >>2. ZIPDIALFor dialing into the very Indian ""missed call"" money-saving tactic. ZipDial's marketing and analytics platform is fashioned out of the ingenious practice of escaping a charge by calling and hanging up to convey a predecided message. Its unique business model works by providing a number for brands to publish on their marketing campaigns. So far, ZipDial has targeted 416 million callers for clients like Disney, Dove, and Coca-Cola, which can now text customers about new deals and product launches. India's largest political parties, the Congress and the BJP, have recently signed up, which means ZipDial is now headed for the mainstream. The service just launched in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and will soon be in Indonesia and the Philippines. Read more >>3. INNOZFor bringing the Internet to India's vast underconnected masses. Innoz's SMSGyan allows feature-phone users to access the Internet anytime and from anywhere by facilitating their web searches via text messages. The service has processed 1.3 billion queries so far and has more than 120 million active users, mostly in India. But the service is also growing in Africa, the Middle East, and other parts of Asia. Innoz was launched by a group of engineering college dropouts who came upon the idea when they weren't able to search for ""How to woo girls"" on their very basic phones.4. GOONJFor galvanizing a behavior shift in urban India to care for those in need. Goonj channels excess resources from urban households to impoverished, rural, and disaster-struck areas. In exchange for clothes, furniture, household goods, and medical supplies, village and slum communities self-organize and build schools, roads, and toilet facilities. The company has thus turned used clothes and other second-hand material into currency, successfully leading more than 1,500 such projects in the past three years alone. It recently delivered thousands of tons of material to the floodstruck in the Himalayas, to cyclone victims in eastern Orissa, and to victims of communal violence in central Muzaffarnagar, through a network of schools and nonprofits. In a large country, Goonj is a game-changer, teaching urban Indians when, what, and how to give.5. ERAM SCIENTIFIC SOLUTIONSFor improving the country's mess of a public-toilet network. Not long ago, Bill Gates let the world know that he was serious about building a better toilet. Eram Scientific Solutions, which makes the Gates Foundation–backed Delight public toilet system, is just proof that the man delivers on his promises. The company's toilet flushes automatically—when people enter, after they leave, and every two hours—to keep tidy, but it also saves energy with motion-sensor lights and fans. Four hundred of them have been installed across the country so far, with a reported 6,000 in the pipeline.6. MITRA BIOTECHFor rethinking conventional cancer drug therapies by applying data analytics.Though it saves lives, chemotherapy—in which enough toxins are pumped into the patient's body to kill malignant cells but spare the host—is still a risky process. Founded by Harvard and MIT researchers, Mitra Biotech's CANScript technology re-creates an artificial environment for a patient's tumor sample and tests various drugs on it directly, allowing the company to arrive at a personalized treatment in less than a week. Mitra has formed partnerships with several Indian hospitals and is eyeing a U.S. entry.7. INTERVIEWSTREETFor leveling the playing ground for coders all over the world. Interviewstreet's disruptive platform helps screen and hire programmers through online coding tests and contests, thus matching best performers from around the globe to business titans. Interviewstreet counts Facebook, Amazon, Morgan Stanley, Zynga, and Walmart among its customers, and it recently placed 40 Indian computer-science students in some of the hottest jobs in the Valley just as they were finishing up their degrees.8. MYDENTISTFor putting smiles on thousands of faces with a Starbucks-inspired chain of dental offices. MyDentist is a two-year-old dental chain based in Mumbai and Pune that has brought dimensions of the retail business to dental treatment. With 75 locations throughout the country, which will grow to 150 this year, MyDentist offers efficient care at standard, transparent rates. It's affordable to the underprivileged crowd, such as cab drivers and domestic workers, who live in slum areas: Root canal treatments cost just 2,500 rupees ($40), and 21,000-rupee braces can be paid in 1,500-rupee ($24) installments. The chain treats a whopping 15,000 patients each month.9. OLACABSFor smoothing the journey of India's growing but scrappy car rental market. Within a year of its launch, Olacabs has grown to become India's largest car rental brand. Its success lies in the myriad tech solutions it uses to navigate the chaos of India's urban commuter system: Its mobile app lets a user summon a cab with a single click and allows real-time tracking of the cab as it nears. Meanwhile, Olacabs' predictive algorithm helps anticipate demand at different locations and times, monitors traffic and weather conditions, and, after a customer books, accurately predicts the time of arrival. Olacabs currently aggregates 7,500 cars in India's four largest cities and achieves an explosive 25% month-over-month growth rate.10. CLOUDNINEFor delivering world-class services and health care to expectant mothers. Despite the ongoing efforts of India's government, the country still lags behind much of the world in infant and maternal mortality rates. Cloudnine, however, has managed to sustain a 0% maternal mortality rate and a 99.72% survival rate across 16,000 deliveries at its five Bangalore-based health-care facilities. The company, which recently scored $16 million in a funding round led by Sequoia Capital, credits its all-hands approach for its success: Its hospitals contain standard pregnancy and neonatal care but also feature specialized units for fetal medicine and workshops for first-time parents.",high,mid,high,low,low

The sage offered him a boon, ""Say, my child, what you want and I will fulfil your wish.""The lazy Brahmin thought and said, ""Get me someone who'd do all my work."" The sage granted him the wish and a genie appeared. The Brahmin grinned but the sage warned, ""You should have enough work to keep the genie occupied. He shall never be free."" The Brahmin nodded and bid adieu to the sage.""Give me work master,"" said the genie. ""Go the farm and water the crops."" And he obeyed. The Brahmin thought that it was no big deal to give orders to the genie. But the genie would return in a few minutes and eagerly ask for a new task.This cycle repeated and finally there left no undone work. ""Give me a work, or I will eat you up!"" roared the genie. The Brahmin got terrified! Then his wife asked, ""Can I give any task to him?"" ""Please do,""agreed the Brahmin. ""Genie, go to the dog, Moti and make his tail straight."" The genie obeyed and never returned again. His wife turned to the Brahmin and said, ""Now did you understand the importance of working? We should do our own jobs and never rely on anyone else. When we completely depend on others for our work, we always get into trouble. The best help we can do to ourselves is to help ourselves.""And the Brahmin went to work in the field from the next day and lived happily ever after. It's a folk tale.

Sanskruti-Siras,"Dr. Ambedkar was the Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Constitution. Undoubtedly he was a great scholar, not only in social sciences but also in literature. It was the time to list out the national languages for the Indian Constitution. Keeping in mind the ancient and historical greatness of the Sanskrit language, Babasaheb had proposed that it should be made as a national language. Now, the Sanskrit language was considered as the mother of all languages. It had perfect and impeccable grammar. And, such language was originated in India. So, Babasaheb strongly desired to have Sanskrit in the list. Meanwhile, in some meeting, he and Mr. Shastri, started to converse on a certain issue unbelievably, in Sanskrit. All the members were dumbstruck. It gathered a lot of media attention. The literary greatness of Ambedkar spread everywhere.Unfortunately, due to the disapproval of other members, Sanskrit couldn't be recognised as our National language. Hindi was preferred as it is widely spoken. He had got very disappointed with this.And today, the world's crazy to learn Sanskrit. The Europeans are running to prove that such divine language originated there. While, years ago, by some fools, Dr. B.R.

Sanskruti-Siras,"The story of Urmila, Lakshman's wifeLakshman’s wife, Urmila, wanted to follow her husband to the forest as Sita had followed Ram but Lakshman begged her to stay back saying, “I will be busy taking care of Ram and Sita and will have not time for you. Help me by staying back so that I do not have to feel guilty or anxious about your wellbeing.” So Urmila stayed back, reluctantly, wondering how she could help her husband help Ram.On the first night in the forest, Lakshman kept watch while Ram and Sita went to sleep. That is when Nidra, the goddess of sleep, approached him. He begged the goddess to leave him alone for fourteen years so that he could guard his brother and sister-in-law night and day. The goddess, impressed by his act of filial devotion, agreed. But the law of nature demanded that someone bear the burden of Lakshman’s share of sleep. “Go to my wife, Urmila, and inform her of the situation,” said Lakshman. Nidra went to Urmila. Urmila bowed her head and replied, “Give me my husband’s share of sleep for fourteen years so that he can stay awake all that time without any fatigue.” So it came to pass that Urmila slept for fourteen years night and day while her husband stayed awake in the service of Ram and Sita.This had an impact in the war against Ravana. Ravana’s mighty son, Meghnadh, was invincible. Only a man who had not slept for 14 years could defeat him. Thus Lakshman was able to kill him, all thanks to Urmila.

Sanskruti-Siras,"This is one of the Aesop fables; I'm sure you've read it at least once in your lifetime. A father had a family of sons. Unfortunately they weren’t very nice to each other. There was constant quarreling and bickering.No matter what this Father said to his sons, it didn’t do any good. As a result he thought long and hard about what he could say. He wanted to provide them some type of lesson that would help them realize the impact that their constant quarreling would ultimately have.One day the quarreling became more aggressive and even violent. The father broke it up and sent each son to a different corner of the yard.It was at that point that this wise Father came up with a lesson. He sent one of the sons to bring him a bundle of sticks.He tied the bundle of sticks and asked each son to take turns in trying to break them. Each of them tried very hard, but couldn’t come close to snapping the bundle.The father then untied the bundle and gave each son one stick and asked them to break it now. They did so easily.He then said: “My sons, do you not see how if you help each other and work with each other, it will be impossible for your enemies to injure you?

Sanskruti-Siras,"I'd like to tell you what happened in my house 14 years ago. My grandmother(dad's mother) used to (maybe still) hate my mom. She hadn't accepted my parents' love marriage even it had been  5 years and they were just blessed with me. Disputes between my mother and my grandmother had been as though it was part of daily routine. There was no peace in the household. Then my dad walked out with my mom, carrying the one year old me with absolutely nothing in his pockets. How difficult it must have been for him! Even though his own real mother was living in town, in the house which he had been brought up, then he had to rent a small quarter 4 blocks away from there. Then, he had no money and no job too. Just some brilliant ideas of stock market. He earned everything from scratch. Today I'm 15 years old and our relations with my grandmother have improved. In 2011, we shifted to live with her after spending a decade in a rented house. My mom has been so adaptive, we forgot the past and today we all live in the same building in peace. She lives on the ground floor, we on the second. Everything is so perfect now. So, yes, moving out is a right decision. At least to heave a sigh of relief. To get space. To relax and take a break from the consistent bad atmosphere. Then once if things get better and normal, you can move in together again or continue to live separately. Just don't cut contact with your parents. They have given you your life. Visiting them ocassionally will do fine. Sometimes we have to take hard and bitter decisions for the better itself.",high,mid,low,low,mid
Sanskruti-Siras,"Sanskrit is undoubtedly one of the most ancient languages and it's superiority is unquestionable. I've been to USA and Germany and I myself saw the respect they have got for Sanskrit. My mom and grandmother both are Sanskrit teachers. I visited schools and universities in Germany and USA and believe me, I was asked whether I, being an Indian, know Sanskrit. I said ""yes"" and they were like ""wow! We learn it here as well"".That day I came to know about the plight of the language. The foreigners are ACTUALLY learning it and we on the other hand TOTALLY neglect our own language and instead run after theirs. Germans have their education in German. Not in English. They just learn English as a supportive language for worldwide network. While we on the other hand have inculcated English as if it's our Mother tongue. I have got no problem with that, I myself love English but I feel it's wrong when we don't learn our indigenous prospects and let others do it.Anyway, it's good that now people have realised the importance of Sanskrit; if not in India, then at least it would get a place in rest of the world.",high,mid,low,low,mid
Sanskruti-Siras,"Jeff worked day and night in a factory to make ends meet and made a satisfactory living. Jeff was friendly at his workplace. Everyone liked him because of his loyalty and modesty. He had a beautiful wife whom he loved a lot. She was so gorgeous, she meant the world to him. He couldn't live without her. As an ideal wife, she always acknowledged the efforts of her husband to earn more. Whenever he was disappointed that he can't give his wife the luxuries of life, she would say, ""Where there is love, there is everything.""As fate could take it, Jeff's wife got severely ill. All the doctors in the villages were visited, all the savings were spent but her condition didn't improve. So, Jeff went to his boss and co-workers to ask for financial help. They all collected money. He thanked them all and said,""Where there is love, there is everything."" But, in spite of the treatments, his wife couldn't be saved.He was depressed. He missed her terribly. He decided to clear all the memories regarding his wife, sell out the house and move to another town. He thought, what can my poor wife have except two pairs of clothes? But, as he searched through her dressing table, to his astonishment, he found rich jewels, rubies and ornaments of all kinds. Further in her trunk of clothes, he discovered elegant gowns and designer garments. He wondered how his wife managed to gather all that stuff.

Sanskruti-Siras,"Just class teacher? Nah. I go to my parents' school. My grandmother is the founder. My dad is the director. Mom, the head mistress. Pretty much my own school? So, there are so so  many pros and cons about it that I've been thinking since childhood. Here are some of them: Advantages :Getting acquainted with the behind the scenes plans: It may be any planning for some meeting, holiday, program, I would be the first to know it. And then, even before the notice pops out in the school, me and my friends used to know every detail (even what is not mentioned in the notice ;) ) So sometimes my dad had to be careful what to discuss with mom at the dining table. And now that I'm in X , he even discusses problems with me.Totally familiar atmosphere: Grandmother and Mom in the premises, so much familiar! Humble treatment from the teachers: I'm a sincere girl but whenever it  used to come to adverse punishment I used to be pardoned with some small dose. All the teachers treated me like their own daughter. I never wanted that, but it came.Emergency services : If ever I fell short of food, stationary stuff, or anything, help is right out there. Thinking that I've listed all the possible advantages, here go the disadvantages. Disadvantages:Being in your limits: My mom didn't like it when I used to cross my limits and be over friendly with some of the teachers. She would say, ""Bapachi shala ahe tar jasta maju nako! "" meaning, ""Even it is your dad's school, stay in your limits!""Getting fake friends:  My classmates stuck around me, I don't know why. Maybe they felt like being in limelight or they felt secure with me. But never to their benefit. I had so many friends at a time, now being in X, I have only 5. Others all fake.Accuses about manipulating marks: I'm the class topper. But I've never been one since the beginning . My classmates and even their parents had once complained and spread rumors that "" I secure the first rank always because it's my school."" Just imagine working hard the whole year, and facing this as the reward. So what of it's ""my"" school, I stand first because I study, you morons! Accuses about extra attention: This always troubled me. Parents complained about their child being neglected by the teacher because of me. How, man? Teacher teaches the same to the whole class! And just because of this ""extra attention "" I 'd come first, according to some.Fear of the teachers : Now you would wonder that if the teachers are friendly why to fear them? But being my teachers, they were my mom's colleagues. Even a small misbehavior would be immediately reported to my mom. That'd follow some lecture at home. This doesn't happen in case of a regular student. :(Ideal behaviour: ""Students watch you!"" Mom would yell. I'm not very punctual and get late every now and then. So, here it goes, ""if you reach late, and we don't punish you, we can't even punish others because they see you being spared. Understand? You're special."" So, in that case I'm special and along while availing some advantages I'm advised to act like a normal student. :P But in spite of it, I've enjoyed my schooling at lot.

Sanskruti-Siras,"The story below is written by my 13 year old self. It was published by The Hindu, Chennai in Summer 2014. We were given a theme to write a fantasy story using the character: Ankur.                                                                          THE FIRST FLIGHTBouncing on the flowers and hopping off the leaves, little Ankur made his way hurriedly to catch his siblings. Out for his first fly the buzzing sound of his wings made him overwhelmed. Very close to his mother, Ankur was too anxious about his fly. But mother never allowed little Ankur to step out of the hive. So this time he went all the way gazing at the greenest valleys, having the most colorful flowers and could easily hear the constant sound of drooping dew in the rare silence.‘’Wow! Such an amazing plant! Brother, you need to see this’’, exclaimed distracted Ankur. There comes no answer. He looked around but found no one in sight. Brave enough and too curious about the thing he tried to peep inside. A layer of glue is what he saw. ‘’I think this fluffy coat is a free of cost bed for tired baby explorers like me to rest on. Shouldn’t I rest on this cute bed?’’, thought Ankur. Forgetting about his siblings and fearlessly entering the mouth of the plant he made himself comfortable on the sticky layer. Enchanted by the sweet odor Ankur soon fell asleep. Completing his short nap, he opened his eyes…..finding himself in some other land. He wandered around, continuously, looking for his family. He couldn’t see anyone nearby. Too upset and losing all the courage Ankur unknowingly sat upon a tender object. “Ouch!’’ Someone cried a second after Ankur dumped himself on that delicate stuff. Ankur hastily got up. ‘’Who was this?’’ he shouted surprisingly. ‘’It’s me, here, look down, little bee.’’ It shocked Ankur when a flower said that with its leaf patting on his shoulder! ‘’A flower! You talk!’’ “Yes. And what’s so astonishing? You are in Pitcher wonderland. Indeed, each and every living being talks here. The only sad thing is that I can’t move. From years I’m stuck here. Well, may I know, who you are?’’ ‘’I…..I……I am Ankur,’’ replied Ankur hastily.He narrated the whole story of his journey till there to the flower, “Flower, please help me. I want to go back to my mother. She must be waiting for me.’’ The flower gave him sympathy and suggested a way of exit, “Look, I really don’t know the exact way out. But you can look upon my advice. You are in a wonderland. This land is controlled by a super natural power known as ‘pitcher land power’. If you will to go out you would’ve to earn ‘pitcher points’ by helping the needy people. If you earn enough points pitcher power would fulfill your wish. And you also can donate your points to other people for their welfare. But Remember, as this is a wonderland everything would be an illusion. You see water, it is land. You see a thorn, it is a petal. And don’t even try to enter the palace gates and restricted castle area. You’ll be cursed and left here forever. Go my son, explore! Earn the pitcher points!’’ Cherished by the words of the flower Ankur headed towards the castle. He explored the free area of the castle. Unwittingly, he entered the restricted area which had the king's armory. He flew around and peeped inside a cannon. He lost his balance and too fast slid downwards! He tried his best to fly up but in vain. He looked down and saw lances poking on him. He lost all his hope and closed his eyes tight, waiting for death. And a minute later Ankur opened his eyes. He saw himself lying on a bed of flowers. He saw a fairy arising before him. His mouth wide open in a surprise, the fairy talked to him, “Thank you dear, you relieved me from the curse of an evil demon.  As a present I gift you 10,000 pitcher points and some of my magical powers. You can use them to go back home."" Too glad by the thought of going back, Ankur first decided to roam and spend some more time in the wonderland. Flying joyfully he reached the palace. Remembering the words of the flower Ankur stopped at the entry gate and asked some questions to the soldier. The soldier told him that the demon resides in the restricted area of the castle. He had invaded this land many times and tortured the king and his subjects. The king and the queen are now imprisoned and when the prince tried to take revenge, the demon turned him into a flower. Ankur, using his magical powers rubbed his palm and to the soldier showed the picture of the flower whom he had talked to. He finally gets that the flower is nobody else but the prince himself. Ankur asked the soldier, “Is there a way of getting the king out and turning the flower a prince again?""    “Yes, there is. If anyone with a kind and loyal heart kills the demon everything he has done by using his magical powers would turn into its original kind. And I think you are perfect for this deed.’’Ankur decided to help the people and give them their king back. He called the fairy and asked her for some help. Together, they made a big army of soldiers. As they weren’t supposed to enter the castle, they preferred air attack. Every solider had his magical wings and all of them threw tons of arrows at the demon from the window. Only in a few moments the evil was lying dead. The people celebrated! The king and the queen were rescued. All of them went to see the prince.For their utter disbelief, the flower instead of turning into the prince, was about to die. The fairy answered them, “The demon must’ve reserved his powers into the flower. That means when the demon would die the flower would also suffer a slow death. If we will to save the prince the one who killed the demon would’ve to give away all his points and pledge that he’ll live in the pitcher world forever.’’ Ankur was helpless. He wanted to serve the wonderland but was also missing his family. He lastly decided to reside in the wonderland rest of the life and save the prince. Ankur bestowed all his points and vowed, “I’ll live here forever! I’ll live here forever! And Yes, I’ll live here forever!!!”From the flower, emerged a handsome prince who with all his heart thanked Ankur. Ankur was happy for the pitcher world but on the other hand very upset for himself. Seeing this pitcher people insisted, “My Lord, Ankur has helped us so much. We should also do something for him in return. He’s missing his parents. Let us send him back home.” The King came up with a locket in his hand and said, “Ankur, wear this. This’ll help you go back home.” As soon as Ankur wore it, thundering started. Ankur, this time really shaken closed his eyes and prayed.He heard a voice growing louder, “Ankur! Son Ankur! Get up sweetheart. Your brothers are ready. Weren’t you excited for your first fly? And what’s this, around your neck?”Story By:Sanskruti SirasNot for reproduction.See Also: Compilation of my Compositions My blog at Quora",high,mid,low,low,mid

Sanskruti-Siras,"THE STORY OF THE GOD OF LOVEKamadeva is the Hindu God of Love and in an important story in the Puranas, Kamdeva was assigned with the mission to stop Lord Shiva’s penance that he started after the death of Sati Devi.After the death of Sati, Lord Shiva entered into yogic penance in the Himalayas. Lord Shiva was no longer interested in the world.Taking advantage of the situation, a demon named Tarakasura, son of Vjranga and Varangi, did Tapas (penance and austerities) and pleased Lord Brahma and got two boons. As the first boon, he asked Brahma to make him the most powerful man in the world. As the second boon he sought that his death should only happen at the hands of a son born to Shiva – thinking that Shiva will never again marry.After getting the boons, Tarakasura showed his true color and started attacking the demi gods, saints and humans. He defeated all the Kings and Devas and took control over earth and heaven.All the Devas and saints sought refuge at the feet of Brahma who told that the only solution for this problem was to bring back Lord Shiva to the world and stop his penance.Brahma told them that Goddess Sati was reborn as Goddess Parvati and was doing penance to get Shiva as her husband. But Shiva was not ready to stop his intense penance.Brahma asked the gods to take the help of Kamadeva to stop the penance by creating sexual desire and passion in Lord Shiva.Kamadeva arrived in front of Shiva along with Ratidevi, and shot five arrows of flowers at the heart of Shiva.Shiva’s meditation was interrupted and he was terribly angry and opened his third eye on his forehead, and a fierce blazing flame came out of his third eye and burned Kamadeva into ashes.The sperm that split from Shiva as the result of the arrows of Kamadeva fell into River Ganga and it was born as six children. These six children were looked after by the Krithiga Stars and were later joined to a single child by Goddess Parvati after her marriage with Lord Shiva. This child was Kartik and he later killed Tarakasura.Shiva was later convinced regarding the intention of Kamdeva and he was later restored.Source: Story - Shiva Burning Kamadeva",high,mid,low,low,mid
Sanskruti-Siras,"The story below is written by my 13 year old self. It was published by The Hindu, Chennai in Summer 2014. We were given a theme to write a fantasy story using the character: Ankur.                                                                          THE FIRST FLIGHTBouncing on the flowers and hopping off the leaves, little Ankur made his way hurriedly to catch his siblings. Out for his first fly the buzzing sound of his wings made him overwhelmed. Very close to his mother, Ankur was too anxious about his fly. But mother never allowed little Ankur to step out of the hive. So this time he went all the way gazing at the greenest valleys, having the most colorful flowers and could easily hear the constant sound of drooping dew in the rare silence.‘’Wow! Such an amazing plant! Brother, you need to see this’’, exclaimed distracted Ankur. There comes no answer. He looked around but found no one in sight. Brave enough and too curious about the thing he tried to peep inside. A layer of glue is what he saw. ‘’I think this fluffy coat is a free of cost bed for tired baby explorers like me to rest on. Shouldn’t I rest on this cute bed?’’, thought Ankur. Forgetting about his siblings and fearlessly entering the mouth of the plant he made himself comfortable on the sticky layer. Enchanted by the sweet odor Ankur soon fell asleep. Completing his short nap, he opened his eyes…..finding himself in some other land. He wandered around, continuously, looking for his family. He couldn’t see anyone nearby. Too upset and losing all the courage Ankur unknowingly sat upon a tender object. “Ouch!’’ Someone cried a second after Ankur dumped himself on that delicate stuff. Ankur hastily got up. ‘’Who was this?’’ he shouted surprisingly. ‘’It’s me, here, look down, little bee.’’ It shocked Ankur when a flower said that with its leaf patting on his shoulder! ‘’A flower! You talk!’’ “Yes. And what’s so astonishing? You are in Pitcher wonderland. Indeed, each and every living being talks here. The only sad thing is that I can’t move. From years I’m stuck here. Well, may I know, who you are?’’ ‘’I…..I……I am Ankur,’’ replied Ankur hastily.He narrated the whole story of his journey till there to the flower, “Flower, please help me. I want to go back to my mother. She must be waiting for me.’’ The flower gave him sympathy and suggested a way of exit, “Look, I really don’t know the exact way out. But you can look upon my advice. You are in a wonderland. This land is controlled by a super natural power known as ‘pitcher land power’. If you will to go out you would’ve to earn ‘pitcher points’ by helping the needy people. If you earn enough points pitcher power would fulfill your wish. And you also can donate your points to other people for their welfare. But Remember, as this is a wonderland everything would be an illusion. You see water, it is land. You see a thorn, it is a petal. And don’t even try to enter the palace gates and restricted castle area. You’ll be cursed and left here forever. Go my son, explore! Earn the pitcher points!’’ Cherished by the words of the flower Ankur headed towards the castle. He explored the free area of the castle. Unwittingly, he entered the restricted area which had the king's armory. He flew around and peeped inside a cannon. He lost his balance and too fast slid downwards! He tried his best to fly up but in vain. He looked down and saw lances poking on him. He lost all his hope and closed his eyes tight, waiting for death. And a minute later Ankur opened his eyes. He saw himself lying on a bed of flowers. He saw a fairy arising before him. His mouth wide open in a surprise, the fairy talked to him, “Thank you dear, you relieved me from the curse of an evil demon.  As a present I gift you 10,000 pitcher points and some of my magical powers. You can use them to go back home."" Too glad by the thought of going back, Ankur first decided to roam and spend some more time in the wonderland. Flying joyfully he reached the palace. Remembering the words of the flower Ankur stopped at the entry gate and asked some questions to the soldier. The soldier told him that the demon resides in the restricted area of the castle. He had invaded this land many times and tortured the king and his subjects. The king and the queen are now imprisoned and when the prince tried to take revenge, the demon turned him into a flower. Ankur, using his magical powers rubbed his palm and to the soldier showed the picture of the flower whom he had talked to. He finally gets that the flower is nobody else but the prince himself. Ankur asked the soldier, “Is there a way of getting the king out and turning the flower a prince again?""    “Yes, there is. If anyone with a kind and loyal heart kills the demon everything he has done by using his magical powers would turn into its original kind. And I think you are perfect for this deed.’’Ankur decided to help the people and give them their king back. He called the fairy and asked her for some help. Together, they made a big army of soldiers. As they weren’t supposed to enter the castle, they preferred air attack. Every solider had his magical wings and all of them threw tons of arrows at the demon from the window. Only in a few moments the evil was lying dead. The people celebrated! The king and the queen were rescued. All of them went to see the prince.For their utter disbelief, the flower instead of turning into the prince, was about to die. The fairy answered them, “The demon must’ve reserved his powers into the flower. That means when the demon would die the flower would also suffer a slow death. If we will to save the prince the one who killed the demon would’ve to give away all his points and pledge that he’ll live in the pitcher world forever.’’ Ankur was helpless. He wanted to serve the wonderland but was also missing his family. He lastly decided to reside in the wonderland rest of the life and save the prince. Ankur bestowed all his points and vowed, “I’ll live here forever! I’ll live here forever! And Yes, I’ll live here forever!!!”From the flower, emerged a handsome prince who with all his heart thanked Ankur. Ankur was happy for the pitcher world but on the other hand very upset for himself. Seeing this pitcher people insisted, “My Lord, Ankur has helped us so much. We should also do something for him in return. He’s missing his parents. Let us send him back home.” The King came up with a locket in his hand and said, “Ankur, wear this. This’ll help you go back home.” As soon as Ankur wore it, thundering started. Ankur, this time really shaken closed his eyes and prayed.He heard a voice growing louder, “Ankur! Son Ankur! Get up sweetheart. Your brothers are ready. Weren’t you excited for your first fly? And what’s this, around your neck?”Story By:Sanskruti SirasOriginally written at my blog Compilation of my Compositions",high,mid,low,low,mid
Sanskruti-Siras,"I was walking on the shore when I heard someone sobbing. My heart is so sad that now I can heart its wails? I had failed to research on my topic in Journalism. 'The hidden secrets.' I was alloted the beach and the ocean. Tomorrow I have to submit my report but I haven't done anything yet! I tried to ignore the cries as my tension was enough for myself. But then as the voice amplified, I followed it. There I encountered a handsome child. He seemed to hail from a good background. He was bright and cute. I coaxed him by giving some toffees I had. ""Why are you crying my child?"" I asked him. ""I have lost my way,"" he said, finding it hard to talk. ""Where is Mother?"" He nodded. He didn't know about her. ""Ok, tell me where do you live?"" I was doubtful if I could help him with the directions as I myself was new to Tarkarli. He cleared his nose with my kerchief and pointed towards the ocean. I was perplexed and thought the child is confused. I took him at my little quarter by the shore and offered him what little I had to eat. I decided to let him in for the night as it was too late. I am going to get an F tomorrow anyway. We both went to sleep. In the middle of the night, I got up to quench my thirst. I walked in sleep till the pot and rubbed my eyes open only to pour water in the glass. I turned around and saw a beautiful lady dressed in a blue long gown walking out the sea. The full moon reflected over her glittery blue dress and I enjoyed the glory. And then I saw the little boy running towards the lady. She lifted him up and he hugged her. She kissed him on the cheeks and hugged tighter. She must be his mother. Then to my shock, I saw both of them leave hand in hand towards the ocean. I ran outside and saw them immerse in the deep waters. Oh my god! Really? Life down the sea? I have got something for the report, Yeah!! I went to sleep tension free excited to be tomorrow's star. The next day on my desk, lied the kerchief I had  given to kid. On it was written with ink of gold, 'Thanks for helping my child. Please keep this a secret. We'll be grateful to you. Yours, The Queen.' I left for the school with a wide smile on my face, prepared, to get an F.",high,mid,low,low,mid

Very common to my age (14-15), I got attracted to one of my classmates. We got into a relationship and after 7 months we broke up. Tomorrow it'd be and month to that, and I had been depressed so much that I had stopped studying for the first 15 days. I suffered from cough and cold (due to excessive crying) and I even screwed up in my exams. All this during 10th Std,  the turning point of any student's life. Today, I tell myself ""only if I had controlled my feelings initially...."" Now, I think that the best time to get into a relationship is when you have achieved your most supreme goal of life. This goal could be any, like completing education, getting a dream job, it may differ from person to person. Set a target that before I don't accomplish this supreme goal of mine, I will control my feelings and only after I get that first, I will look upon the love factor. That's the perfect time.

Sanskruti-Siras,"I will like to state here The Cellular Jail at the Andaman Islands, the south east India. The Cellular Jail was built by the British to house freedom fighters and it was known to give the worst and most dreadful punishments and treatments. Prisoner Life in Cellular JailDuring twelve hours of the night, the warder insisted that the prisoner shall have no occasion to ease himself. The pot was so diminutive and that one could not discharge into it even once during the night. As for nature's call one had to go down on his knees to the Jamadar to let him out. The Warder may not take the call seriously. He may be reluctant himself or he may fear the Officer. The prisoner had, therefore, to check it till the morning. If the Warder realised and carried the matter to the Jamadar, the Jamadar would severely create the convict for the call at such an odd hour. He would or would not report to the doctor as his fancy or memory may guide him. The doctor's report on the ailment was never made or made only in one case out of a hundred. That report had to go to Mr. Barrie and Mr. Barrie would take action upon it at his own sweet will. Imagine the prisoner's condition during the night and during this process of red-tape. Particularly when the call was not normal but an abnormal and sudden ailment. In the morning Mr. Barrie, would sit in judgement upon it, rebuke sternly the warder and the Jamadar for their lapses of duty. When he prayed in this fashion there was no answering him. The prisoner was also cross examined by Mr. Barrie and if the former said that he could not help the call of nature Mr. Barrie would tum round upon him fiercely with the ejaculation why the devil did you have it? And if the wretched creature had the courage to say, I got it because I get it, the Jamadar would give a slap in the face and scold him for giving such an insolent answer. Usually the prisoner was let off only with this cannonade of word. But Mr. Barrie's particular kindness to the prisoner always ended in an order to put him immediately on the grinding mill.Freedom Fighter's in Cellular JailSome of the better known political prisoners incarcerated in the Cellular Jail were Barindra Kumar Ghosh, Upendra Nath Banerjee, Hem Chandra Das, Ullaskar Dutta, Indubushan Roy, Bibhuti Bushan Sarkar, Hrishikesh Kanjilal, Sudhin Kumar Sarkar, Abinash Chandra Bhattacharji & Birendra Chandra Sen. All these prisoners were sent to the Cellular Jail after 1910 on their conviction for participation in the Manictollah Conspiracy case. Vir Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was sent to Andamans on 4th July 1911 with sentence of two transportations for life. When he came to the Cellular Jail his elder brother, Ganesh Savarkar was already there. But the Savarkar brothers came to know about this fact only after having been in Jail over a year.The documentary of EPIC channel on the Cellular Jail brings tears to one's eyes.

Sanskruti-Siras,"The burglar who stole my life Why is someone knocking at the door so late at night? It’s past midnight, who can be there at this hour? I thought to myself. I tiptoed down the stairs through the living room to the front door. Parents were out of station. I didn’t notice anything amiss, although, I felt a bit uneasy being home alone. Being wise, I first peered through the door hole… nobody. Must be a prank…I turned to return upstairs. *knock knock* I was startled. This time I gathered all courage and opened the door. A few bats flew away. No sign on anybody. Strange. Evidently, the bats cannot knock. As I was closing the door, I heard footsteps from upstairs. My heart was thumping. To end the horror, I went upstairs but armed with a knife as I thought it’s better to be ready for any attacks. I suspected there were burglars. When I was walking up the stairs, it was totally dark. So as anyone would, I switched on the light. Just then, I saw a shadow moving from my bedroom to my parents’. I went into my room to see what had happened and to my surprise, all my valuables were gone. My laptop, my TV and above all – MY MOBILE! I could make do without a laptop or even a TV but my life resided in the mobile. For a moment, I really felt lifeless.Recovering, to bring help, I used the landline in my room and called the police. They arrived very quickly. I told them that the thief was in my parents’ room. We rushed into the bedroom and there she was. Standing with all my stuff and when the light shone on her, I knew who it was. It was my charwoman who was instructed to do so by my parents so I keep away from the gadgets and concentrate on my studies.       SANSKRUTI SIRAS19/4/2015Originally written at my blog : Compilation of my Compositions.",high,mid,low,low,mid

Nothing unleashes creativity better than that. Now pen down all your ideas. Just whatever comes to the mind. This not necessarily should be in chronological order. Just put down your idea.Have a separate sheet for characters. Write about them. Their overall personality, appearance, behaviour, psychology, etc. You'd need this while describing your characters and to interpret how each will react to some situations.Make sure you write about different chapters on separate pages so that you can rearrange and editing the notes can be easy.Read that notes you have now. Missed a point? Add. Didn't like something?  Edit. This procedure can take hours or days. It depends on you.When you're done with the notes, use MS Word to start writing.

Success will hug you when you make space for success.Credibility is not built overnight. If your problems are as colossal as a rock, remember, even the water can carve a stone. It takes years, but water never gives up. Only when you ignore yourself, you feel being ignored by others. One doesn't need to be famous for getting attention. One just need to be active and interactive.Work with the spirit of inquisitiveness and enthusiasm.

Atreya-Majumdar,"First of all let me clarify that the next term can be a lot of terms, because theoretically there exists more than one function which can connect these points. graphically speaking, these 5 points can be joined by infinitely mane curves, each of which corresponds to a different function.          I am assuming a polynomial function for finding that particular function. Since I have only 5 points, I can assume that the polynomial has degree four( since the number of unknown coefficients in that case is 5, which is precisely why we can solve the simultaneous equation from the given data).So, let, f(x)=ax4+bx3+cx2+dx+ef(x)=ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+eTherefore, f(1)=3=a+b+c+d+ef(1)=3=a+b+c+d+ef(2)=10=16a+8b+4c+2d+ef(2)=10=16a+8b+4c+2d+ef(3)=29=81a+27b+9c+3d+ef(3)=29=81a+27b+9c+3d+ef(4)=66=256a+64b+16c+4d+ef(4)=66=256a+64b+16c+4d+ef(5)=127=625a+125b+25c+5d+ef(5)=127=625a+125b+25c+5d+eNow, after doing a lot of mathematics, which will do nothing but lengthen my answer, we find that, a=c=d=0,b=1a=c=d=0, b=1  and e=2e=2Thus f(x)=x3+2f(x)=x^3+2Hence, f(6)=63+2=218f(6)=6^3+2=218Thus 218 is one of the infinitely other numbers in the next position of the series.",mid,high,high,mid,high

The demon transformed to the boy's lost father, and the boy morphed into the demon.......The curse of the demon was that whoever killed it, turned into that very demon.

Atreya-Majumdar,"The last loverIt has been years since the cuckoo bird sang. The last time the rose blossomed in it's brightest colours was before the deadly virus struck human kind. It erased all the forms of love resident in the human mind. Mankind have turned into mindless animals who are only driven by their one narrow interests. They had forgotten to dream.But.......There was a heart which the virus couldn't afflict. He was a soldier who had led a very remarkable life.Remarkable indeed was the colour of the curtain that hung over the hospital bed on which he laid, injured. It was a brilliant combination of green and purple.Green and purple, were the colours of the dress which she had worn when they had first met. They were not lovers, they were partners in the battle field called life.Life, was the things they wanted to spend together, to grow old together. He used to write her poems, which would make her blush to the colour of the roses that he brought her.Her..... she was everything that he knew, that he dreamt, that he meant. But like the dreams too, it shattered into pieces one day. Like the bright beautiful day which always succumbs to the dark night, it ended. The promise they made each other of holding hands till the end, fell apart.She was one of the first to be struck by the virus. The eyes that nested only her image once, had never been so full of tears.Teary was his eyes when he glanced outside at the nature through the window and then glanced at his own nature. He could never move on. In the loveless world in front of him, he lay on the bed clutching his own pillow, clutching at his own heart to fulfill a desire.A desire to run away from everything and hug her.But...he couldn't run. Just as, all had lost their dreams, he had lost his limbs.",mid,high,high,mid,high
Atreya-Majumdar,"I will have to let some statistical data do the talking for me. Last few years had been one of the greatest times for Patha Bhavan in terms of academic success. From IIT to ISI, we are cracking it all. Also, we are simultaneously doing good in the boards. I have personally heard that a teacher from another eminent school, Jodhpur Park Boys, to be precise had said that right now Patha Bhavan is one of the few best schools in West Bengal.Ok, enough prelude. So it is quite evident that that our school is doing really good, and it is not my personal opinion. The result and outsiders are saying it. You know almost in every institution in the world, even the best, the students studying complain about it. It is because the students who are in direct contact actually knows the weak points of the institution. It is precisely this reason for which I have prevented myself from making a comment on personal knowledge, as I am very much privy to the negative aspects of our school. Coming to the main point, all the new teachers recruited by our school have been in our school for a very small amount of time( except Shouvik sir) to make any serious impact(sorry I cannot tell about the new english faculty). So it would be unwise for us to conjecture upon the fact that if they would be able to replace the good teachers of Patha Bhavan. But one thing I believe for sure is that, if the new recruited teachers would have to replace the existing teachers, they will have to do a terrific job.Speaking on an extrapolated level, I think that nowadays good teachers are getting rarer because, we the students of today do not aspire to be teachers. So the best students go to different lines and the second or third best comies to teaching....Sayantan, Rupendra, students like you should contemplate on this point as a career option.Hence our next generation would surely respond positively to this very question.",mid,high,high,mid,high

Roshna-Nazir,"1. Walking in front of your crush. Losing all the motor skills and wondering what to do next with your body.2. Pretending you are actually surprised about a 'Surprise Birthday Party' thrown at you, although you knew exactly what they were up to, all the while.3. Not hearing someone say something and then pretend like you did, 'cause you really didn't want them to repeat that boring shit all over again or didn't want to seem dumb or deaf. You just Laugh and Hope for the best.4. Start with a sentence. Repeat it thrice. But that someone manages to overpower you and talk over you all the three times. And you just chuck that sentence.5. You suddenly realize you forgot something. And while you turn back and start walking in the opposite direction, you take out your phone and pretend like you just read an important text, and then frown at it, like you just forgot something very important, how stupid of you to forget such a thing, so people don't consider you a lunatic.6. Hiding in your room until your annoying, curious, inquisitive guests are home. And someone elderly in that group, calls out your name loud, and you act like you were very busy doing something very very important and say, Yeaaahh! Just a minute!7. When the teacher announces 'Choose your partner. Two in a team' and you are a group of three best friends.

And then make that sound again and again so everybody sees you and hears you, so you confirm it to them it wasn't a fart.  9. Not catching someone's name and avoiding them for the rest of your life.10. Having an imaginary argument in the head and make corresponding insane-looking facial expressions. And you find out someone was staring at you and you act like you're trying really hard to get the bothering stuck piece of chicken off your teeth, with your tongue.11. Trying hard to make an eye contact during an awkward conversation. In the course of doing that, miss the conversation and have a blank expression in your face making it still more awkward, which is then followed by the 'Fuck-the-eye-contact' expression and you just want to leave that place.12. Play your favorite song to your friends and the opening music takes too long. You say, It gets better in a minute. Your friends begin to lose interest. So you fast forward it and realize you just skipped the best part. Try to rewind and they've almost left the place. You just put on your headphones and get over it. 13. Someone sits next to you while you were just about to get up. You wait for another 5 minutes before you get up 'cause you do not want to hurt their feelings. Or do not want to imply they smelled bad or something. 14. Someone knocks your door and you really really do not want to open. You pretend you are asleep. But the person takes it up as a challenge and just doesn't stop knocking. You then make a sleepy face and say, yeaaah waaaait, in a sleepy voice. And then walk like a handicapped to open the door.15.
