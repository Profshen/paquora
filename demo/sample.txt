Honest answer; perhaps. Though, chances are, if it were even legal to own a firearm in France, I very much doubt anyone would still be ready to stop a suicide assault. The tactics of the terrorist may have been different, and the loss of life greater from multiple bomb attacks etc.

In addition to this, the time leading up to this is moment would likely have more loss of life for the unreasonable use of guns, similar to how other countries that legalise the ownership of such weapons. The initial questions should be, is it worth it?
